###Overview
For this project, we are seeking to improve the time to diagnosis to heart failure diagnosis by leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data. Specifically, we aim to use various methods to pull the various diagnostic components from EHR, then analyze and process them to assist with heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) diagnosis. For this class specifically, we are looking to leverage  the unstructured text from medical notes using NLP to assist in HF diagnosis. We will determine the diagnostic ability of unstructured text notes in determing HF and then compare it to other known diagnostic and predictive factors. 

###Introduction 
Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.
Heart failure (HF) is a progressive clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood. It carries a poor prognosis with 50% mortality within the first 5 years of diagnosis, and is associated with significant co-morbidity and remarkable decrease in quality of life and functional status. Unfortunately, recent data suggest HF-associated mortality and morbidity are on the rise. 

While the reason for the HF-related poor outcomes is multifactorial, an early and time-sensitive diagnosis has been shown to paly a significant role. In fact, research showed that a time-sensitive diagnosis of HF may reduce patientsâ€™ mortality and morbidity. As such, wide research efforts are being deployed to develop processes including algorithms to support clinicians (particularly non-cardiologist) in early diagnosing HF. 


### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

For this project, we are using MIMIC-III which is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. This is a vast dataset with many variables. We just got accessed to the dataset yesterday (11/16/2022) and are planning to pull the data, query it and start analyzing. 

To retrieve the data, we are using Google Big Query to pull the data onto our local environment. As part of retrieving that data via Google Big Query, we will need to make use of SQL. Specifically, we will pull pertinent tables.

### Results
```{r eval = TRUE}
#Read in some tables. ***learn how to read into table (as opposed to import them) from downloads file. 
head(PATIENTS)
summary(PATIENTS)
head(DIAGNOSES_ICD)
#***the noteevents dataset is not uploading

#Creating a gtsummary table
#Will need to do some descriptive statistics. Use praticum 4 for basic descriptive statistisc and praticum 3 (for visualization of that data)
library(dplyr)
PATIENTS %>% gtsummary::tbl_summary() .#May consider creating an arbitrary date to allow for age. 



#Consider using codes below
#nhanes %>% 
  #dplyr::select(-c(id, income, education)) %>%
  #gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = asthma) %>%
  #gtsummary::add_p()
```


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
