## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Pediatric emergency care (PEC) is a complex and fast-paced environment that treats patients across the healthcare and socio-demographic spectrums. Recently, there has been increasing focus on overall care quality and disparities in PEC. Disparities are known to exist in timely pain management by patient race and that those with non-English language proficiency have an increased risk of adverse medical events. Revisits, or returning to the emergency department within 72 hours of discharge, are an important marker of care quality and performance indicator of a department. While patients represent to the emergency room following a visit for various reasons, including progression of disease or repeat medication administration, it may signal incomplete ED care or insufficient anticipatory guidance. Revisits are also associated with increased healthcare costs, over-crowding and system stress, and decreased satisfaction of both families and staff.

Understanding the disparities associated with increased revisit rates and discovering modifiable factors is needed to offer solutions. This study will examine the association of sociodemographic and visit-specific factors that are associated with revisits that result either in a repeat discharge or hospitalization.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

#### Study Design

This is a retrospective study of patients, between 0-18 years old, presenting to a tertiary, academic pediatric emergency department between November 01, 2021 to November 01, 2023. Data was accessed through the institutional data warehouse, extracted from patient and encounter-level tables, deidentified, and downloaded as a CSV file.

**Outcome Measures**

The primary outcomes were return visits within 72 hours regardless of revisit encounter disposition, and return visits in 72 hours that resulted in admission, including observation, to the hospital.

**Factor Inclusion**

A priori, we selected both visit and patient-level factors. Visit-level factors included daily volume (separated into quartiles for each Campus), daily median acuity, daily median wait time, time of arrival to the ED (daytime: 7a to 3p, evening: 3p to 11p, overnight: 11p to 7a), length of stay, disposition type (discharged, Against Medical Advise (AMA)/Eloped) and ED location (main vs community campus).

::: {.column-margin style="bg: gray;"}
^1^Sex is being used based on availability and labeling in the data warehouse and is being treated as dichotomous. Author recognizes non-binary gender as the more appropriate variable to be used.
:::

Patient-level factors include age (\<1 year and \> 1 year) , sex^1^, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Other), preferred language (English, Non-English), individual triage acuity (1-5), history of complex medical conditions (Y/N), insurance status (Commercial, Government, Charity Care, Self-Pay), Childhood Opportunity Index (COI; Very High to Very Low), and whether they had a primary care physician (PCP) visit within 72 hours of their index ED visit (Y/N)^2^.

::: column-margin
^2^Other variables to include in future analyses include *patient distance from the ED*, *green space access,* and *top diagnosis.*

## Results {#sec-results}

### Department Summary

Continuous variables were summarized using mean, median, and interquartile range, as appropriate.\
Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages.\
A portion of these variables were collapsed into dichotomous variables based on previous research.

A total of 211,583 patients \< 19 years old were seen across both emergency department campuses between November 1, 2021 and November 1, 2023. There is a notable difference in daily visits between both campuses, which is expected given the bed availability is much larger at main (\~56) compared to community (\~21). Average acuity was 3.2 and 3.13. Median wait time was 24 minutes and 19 minutes. Median length of stay (LOS) was 3.22 hours and 3.43 hours. At the main campus, a total of 6938 (4.4%) patients returned to the ED following their index visit, and of those 1722 (1.1%) were admitted to the hospital. At the community campus, 2758 (5.1%) patient returned within 72 hours, and 818 (1.5%) were admitted to the hospital.

### Multivariable Logistic Regression

In multivariable regression, the following characteristics were associated with a higher odds of revisit within 72 hours: being under 1 years old, having a longer length of stay at the index visit, having Governmental insurance, having a chronic or complex medical condition, index visit arrival during overnight shifts, having an index disposition of eloped or leaving against medical advice, having an index visit at the community campus, or having a visit with a primary care physician within 72 hours of the index visit. Of note, certain factors were associated with a lower odds of revisit. These included: having a longer index visit wait time, being Non-Hispanic Black, having an index acuity of non-urgent, or having no insurance/self-pay.

```{r}
# Regression
m1 <- glm(REVISIT_72_HR ~ SEX + age_cat + eth_cat + ED_LOS + LANGIND + PAYOR_GROUP + COI + esigp + COMPLEX_CHRONIC_CONDITION_IND + Arrival + ED_DISPOSITION + CAMPUS + PCP_VISIT_72_HR + volume + waithr, data = data, family = binomial())

#Table
t3 <- tbl_regression(m1, exponentiate = TRUE) %>%
  bold_p(t = 0.05) %>%
  bold_labels() %>%
  italicize_levels()
```

On return, patients were at higher odds of being admitted if they were under 1 years old, had a longer length of stay at the index visit, had a chronic or complex medical condition, had an index visit arrival during overnight shifts, had an index disposition of eloped/AMA, had an index visit at the community campus, or had a visit with a primary care physician within 72 hours of the index visit. Similarly, certain factors were associated with a lower odds of revisit. These included: having a longer index visit wait time, having an index acuity of non-urgent, or having no insurance/self-pay.

```{r}
#Create subset of only patient readmitted within 72 hours
readmit <- data|>
   select(SEX, AGE_AT_VISIT, age_cat, esigp, eth_cat, LANGIND, PAYOR_GROUP, COI, ACUITY, COMPLEX_CHRONIC_CONDITION_IND, CAMPUS, ED_LOS, Arrival, ED_DISPOSITION, PCP_VISIT_72_HR, volume, waithr, READMIT_72_HR)
```

```{r}
# Regression
m.adm <- glm(READMIT_72_HR ~ SEX + age_cat + eth_cat + ED_LOS + LANGIND + PAYOR_GROUP + COI + esigp + COMPLEX_CHRONIC_CONDITION_IND + Arrival + ED_DISPOSITION + CAMPUS + PCP_VISIT_72_HR + volume + waithr, data = readmit, family = binomial())

#Create Table
t.adm <- tbl_regression(m.adm, exponentiate = TRUE) %>%
  bold_p(t = 0.05) %>%
  bold_labels() %>%
  italicize_levels()

#Merge tables of Any Revisit and Readmission
tbl.merge<- tbl_merge(tbls = list(t3, t.adm),
            tab_spanner = c("**Any Revisit**", "**Revisit to Admission**"))

#Table as gt
tbl.merge |>

## Conclusion

At a tertiary, academic, free-standing children's hospital with two emergency department campuses, 4.6% of patients returned to the ED within 72 hours of being discharged. Of those, 26% were admitted to the hospital on their return visit. This is consistent with national revisit trends at comparable children's hospitals. Similar to previous studies, presence of chronic/complex conditions, younger age, and later ED arrival time were associated with increased risk for revisit.

When considering disparities, consistent with prior data, publicly insured individuals were more like to return to the ED, but were not more likely to be hospitalized upon return. Non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely to return, but were not less likely to be admitted upon return. Patients without insurance/self-pay were significantly less likely to revisit or be hospitalized upon return. This should be further explored to elucidate whether this is due to provider bias vs familial preference. It would also be interesting to examine whether these patients overall receive less workup and fewer diagnostic tests. Compared to other studies, there was no association between non-English language proficiency and increased risk of return. This may be explained by recent expanded hospital efforts to have video and in-person translators available in multiple languages. Childhood opportunity index was also not associated with revisit rates, contrary to previous studies.

Additionally, we found that patients who visited their PCP within 72 hours were associated with increased risk of hospitalization upon return. This goes against conventional belief that increased access to one's PCP should decrease need for ED use. The current findings may may be explained if sicker patients are more likely to request PCP follow-up, but further exploration is necessary, particularly by examining outcomes of the associated PCP visits and whether ED referrals from said visits were made.

There are some notable limitations of this study. First, reason for revisit is not easily assessed. Patients may return to the ED for many reasons, including disease progression, as instructed for repeat testing, or because of incomplete care or inadequate discharge instructions. We are also unable to determine if the patient is returning for a completely unrelated reason. Second, our data does not include a revisit to EDs outside of the single academic institution, so the true rate may be higher than reported. However, our rates are consistent with national averages.

Overall, this study has shown that certain patient and visit-level factors are associated with either an increased or decreased risk of revisit to the emergency department. Most patients who do re-present will be re-discharged, but those that aren't tend to be younger and chronically ill. This work gives us benchmarks and better areas of focus to reduce disparities in care and provide appropriate resources to patients. Future efforts should examine the role of and the communication with the pediatrician at the index visit.
