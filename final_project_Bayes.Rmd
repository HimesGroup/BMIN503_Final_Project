### Overview
*Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.*

This project considers the burdens of poor air quality and its health consequences, and how they fall on different American communities. To explore and understand these relationships, I use daily site-level testing data from the EPA's Air Quality System for small particulate matter (PM2.5) from 2019, linked with census data for the tract surrounding each testing site. I am still determining how I can best incorporate data on the near-term health effects of poor air quality, although my main goal is not to use air quality to predict those health outcomes, but rather to determine whether there are differences (e.g. in extent/significance) between how community characteristics predict air quality and how those same characteristics predict the prevalence of events like emergency department presentations for asthma exacerbation. In developing a plan for this project I met with Drs. Anil Vachani, Gary Weissman, and John P. Reilly, who provided insights on the causal pathway from pollution sources to specific EPA-measured pollutants to short- and long-term health outcomes; potential data sources and analytic approaches; the ways in which "natural experiments" related to major changes in pollutant generation have been used to compare the effects of perturbation from a steady state; and more. Materials for this project can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/bayesb/BMIN503_Final_Project). 

### Introduction 
*Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem. Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.*

Poor air quality can have a substantial negative influence on health and quality of life, but different people will have different resources, incentives, and tradeoffs to consider in determining where to live, and we might expect that the relationship between who lives where and air quality is more complex than people with more wealth, income, and social power concentrating in places with better air quality. By considering many different community characteristics in building models to predict poor air quality, it is possible to learn which factors are most strongly associated with air quality and how successfully models trained on community characteristics can predict poor air quality and related health events.

### Methods
*Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.*

### Results
*Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.*

Perform bivariate tests of community characteristics vs air quality (continous measures and 1/0 for poor air quality above threshold). Create multivariate models to predict air quality from community characteristics. Construct a classifier using community characteristics and evaluate its performance against the real data.
