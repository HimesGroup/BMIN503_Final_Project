### Overview
*Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.*

This project considers the burdens of poor air quality and its health consequences, and how they fall on different American communities. 



To explore and understand these relationships, I use daily site-level testing data from the EPA's Air Quality System for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from 2019, linked with 2018 data from the 5-year American Community Survey for the tract surrounding each testing site.


In developing a plan for this project I met with Drs. Anil Vachani, Gary Weissman, and John P. Reilly, who provided insights on the causal pathway from pollution sources to specific EPA-measured pollutants to short- and long-term health outcomes; potential data sources and analytic approaches; the ways in which "natural experiments" related to major changes in pollutant generation have been used to compare the effects of perturbation from a steady state; and more. Materials for this project can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/bayesb/BMIN503_Final_Project). 

### Introduction 
*Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem. Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.*

Poor air quality can have a substantial negative influence on health and quality of life, but different people will have different resources, incentives, and tradeoffs to consider in determining where to live, and we might expect that the relationship between who lives where and air quality is more complex than people with more wealth, income, and social power concentrating in places with better air quality. By considering many different community characteristics in building models to predict poor air quality, it is possible to learn which factors are most strongly associated with air quality and how successfully models trained on community characteristics can predict poor air quality and related health events.

Very small particulate matter in the air can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing respiratory and cardiovascular health problems such as asthma attacks, bronchitis, heart attacks, and more. Particulate matter as a pollutant is classified as either fine or coarse.

Fine: Less than 2.5 microns in diameter. Referred to as PM 2.5.
Coarse: Between 2.5 and 10 microns

12 micrograms per cubic meter is considered the maximum acceptable concentration of PM 2.5 in ambient air. This corresponds to the boundary between the “Good” (green) and “Moderate” (yellow) zones for the Air Quality Index (AQI) as updated in 2012.


How strong are the associations between household characteristics and PM 2.5 levels?
Can household characteristics be used to confidently predict whether a community will experience worse air quality (in terms of PM 2.5)?


Particulate matter as a pollutant is classified as either fine or coarse.
Major source of PM 2.5: Combustion
Car engines
Coal- or gas-fired power plants
Burning wood
Localized sources like major highways and industrial plants may be undesirable neighbors, but air quality will rarely be the top consideration in where people live.
The tradeoffs between living near sources of pollution and other factors such as job availability, housing affordability, proximity to family, friends, recreation, etc. may work out differently for different types of households.


### Methods
I begin by defining a function to create a data frame from the results of a GET call to the EPA's Air Quality System API. I create objects with relevant reference lists and define a vector for the "lower 48" U.S. states and Washington, D.C. for later use. 

```{r get-AQS-setup, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Retrieve environment variables with EPA AQS API credentials
api.email <- Sys.getenv("EPA_AQS_EMAIL")
api.key   <- Sys.getenv("EPA_AQS_KEY")

# Function to create a data frame based on an API call
download.AQS <- function(whichData,customParams) { 
  rootpath <- "https://aqs.epa.gov/data/api/"
  morepath <- paste0(rootpath,whichData)
  fullParams <- append(list(email = api.email, key = api.key),customParams)
  step1.json <- httr::GET(url = morepath, query = fullParams)
  step2.parsed <- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(step1.json,"text"), simplifyVector = FALSE)
  step3.df <- tibble(Data = step2.parsed$Data) %>% unnest_wider(.,Data)
  return(step3.df)
}

# Fetch documentation for daily data summaries, state code list
dailyData.dictionary <- download.AQS("metaData/fieldsByService",list(service = "dailyData"))
list.states <- download.AQS("list/states",list())

# Omitting state codes other than 48 states + D.C.
list.states.lower48 <- list.states %>% filter(!(code %in% c("02","15","66","72","78","80","CC")))
list.states.lower48
lower48.codes <- as.vector(as.matrix(list.states.lower48[,1]))
```

To manage downloading daily PM2.5 data for each state for all of 2019, I define another function to loop through the state FIPS codes for given date parameters. Executing this step with 1 call per month of data takes roughly 90 minutes, so I save the resulting data frame and load it in the chunk below.
```{r download-AQS-2019, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Pull daily PM2.5 (parameter 88101) data for these states, with arguments for date range
get.daily.lower48 <- function(b,e){
collector <- data.frame()
for (s in seq_along(lower48.codes)) {
  newstate <- download.AQS("dailyData/byState", list(param="88101", bdate=b, edate=e, state=list.states.lower48[s,1]))
  collector <- bind_rows(collector,newstate)
  }
  return(collector)
}

# Run in monthly batches
dailyPM2.5_201901 <- get.daily.lower48("20190101","20190131")
dailyPM2.5_201902 <- get.daily.lower48("20190201","20190228")
dailyPM2.5_201903 <- get.daily.lower48("20190301","20190331")
dailyPM2.5_201904 <- get.daily.lower48("20190401","20190430")
dailyPM2.5_201905 <- get.daily.lower48("20190501","20190531")
dailyPM2.5_201906 <- get.daily.lower48("20190601","20190630")
dailyPM2.5_201907 <- get.daily.lower48("20190701","20190731")
dailyPM2.5_201908 <- get.daily.lower48("20190801","20190831")
dailyPM2.5_201909 <- get.daily.lower48("20190901","20190930")
dailyPM2.5_201910 <- get.daily.lower48("20191001","20191031")
dailyPM2.5_201911 <- get.daily.lower48("20191101","20191130")
dailyPM2.5_201912 <- get.daily.lower48("20191201","20191231")
 
# Concatenate monthly batch files into a single file for 2019
all.2019.dailyPM2.5 <- bind_rows( dailyPM2.5_201901
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201902
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201903
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201904
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201905
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201906
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201907
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201908
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201909
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201910
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201911
                                 ,dailyPM2.5_201912)

# Save full 2019 raw file
saveRDS(all.2019.dailyPM2.5, file = "all2019dailyPM25.RDS")

```

I test combinations of testing site location identifiers and add a single `site_id` variable to the 2019 PM2.5 data set by concatenating location identifiers. I also create a data frame with one observation per testing site.
```{r unique-AQS-sites, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Load the full 2019 raw file
all.2019.dailyPM2.5 <- readRDS("all2019dailyPM25.RDS")
str(all.2019.dailyPM2.5)

# Create a file of all unique combinations of geographic indicators for testing sites
testing.sites <- all.2019.dailyPM2.5 %>%
                      dplyr::select(state_code, state, 
                             county_code, county,
                             city, cbsa_code, cbsa,
                             site_number, local_site_name, site_address,
                             latitude, longitude) %>%
                      unique() %>%
                      arrange(state_code,county_code,site_number)
dim(testing.sites)
# 965 combinations

# Create a single unique ID column for site
testing.sites %>% dplyr::select(site_number) %>% unique() %>% dim()
testing.sites %>% dplyr::select(state_code,site_number) %>% unique() %>% dim()
testing.sites %>% dplyr::select(state_code,county_code,site_number) %>% unique() %>% dim()
# Only 253 unique site numbers. 770 state-site combos. 
# State + county + site number *is* unique (965 combos)

clean.2019.dailyPM2.5 <- all.2019.dailyPM2.5 %>%
  mutate(site_id = paste0(state_code,county_code,site_number))

```

Using the `tigris::tracts` function, I retrieve the geometries, GEOIDs, and other spatial information for census tracts and join each AQS testing site to the data for the tract within which it lies, based on the latitude and longitude from AQS. I looping through the state FIPS codes one at a time and stack the results into a single crosswalk file. This step is time-consuming so I save the resulting file and load it in the next step.  

```{r spatial-join, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Prepare for spatial merge. Create sf file from testing site coordinates
testing.sites.sf.points <- st_as_sf(testing.sites, coords = c('longitude','latitude'), crs = 4269)

# Download census tract sf shapefiles, one state at a time.
# Perform spatial joins one state at a time to avoid having to build the national tract shapefile.
for (s in seq_along(lower48.codes)) {
  newstate <- lower48.codes[s]
  newtracts <- tracts(newstate)
  newjoin <- st_join(newtracts, testing.sites.sf.points, join = st_contains, left=FALSE)
  if (s==1){
    testing.sites.tracts <- newjoin
  } else {
    testing.sites.tracts <- bind_rows(testing.sites.tracts,newjoin)
  }
}

# Save file with testing sites <> census tract
saveRDS(testing.sites.tracts, file = "testing_sites_tracts.RDS")
```

From `tidycensus` I now retrieve the variable list for the 2018 5-year American Community Survey. After reviewing the concepts from those variables as well as the [questionnaire](http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/2018/quest18.pdf), I create an object with a set of variables to test for associations with the AQS data.

```{r set-ACS-var-list, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
testing.sites.tracts <- readRDS("testing_sites_tracts.RDS")
head(testing.sites.tracts)

# Load a data frame with all 5-year ACS variables
census.1yr.vars <- load_variables(dataset = "acs5",year = 2018)
head(census.1yr.vars)

# Simplify the variable list to make it easier to review the major concepts represented
census.1yr.concept.counts <- 
  census.1yr.vars %>% 
  mutate(root.concept = str_split_fixed(concept," BY",2)[,1]) %>%
  mutate(root.concept = str_split_fixed(root.concept," \\(",2)[,1]) %>% 
      # Double escape needed to match open parenthesis!
  mutate(root.name = substring(name,1,6)) %>%
  group_by(root.name,root.concept) %>%
  summarise(obs=n(), .groups="keep") %>%
  arrange(root.name,-obs)

# View(sort(unique(census.1yr.concept.counts$root.concept)))

# After reviewing the variable list, create an object with the ones of interest
final.acs.var.list <- census.1yr.vars %>% filter(name %in% c(
     "B01002_001" # median age
    ,"B03002_003","B03002_001" # Hon-Hisp-White-alone // Denom
    ,"B02009_001","B02001_001" # Black race, alone or in combination // Denom

    ,"B08013_001" # Aggregate travel time to work in minutes
  )) %>% arrange(name)

final.acs.var.list

```

Once more I loop through the state FIPS codes, retrieving the ACS variables of interest by tract as a flat file using `tidycensus::get_acs` and preserving the data only for the census tracts that contain AQS testing sites. As this is another slow step, I save the resulting data frame. 

```{r download-ACS-for-tracts, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
head(testing.sites.tracts)

# Keep only what is needed to make the ACS calls in a small data frame
tst.minimal <- testing.sites.tracts %>% 
                mutate(site_id = paste0(state_code,county_code,site_number)) %>%
                dplyr::select(site_id, GEOID, STATEFP, COUNTYFP)
st_geometry(tst.minimal) <- NULL

# Loop through existing list of state codes
lower48.codes

# Make ACS calls one state at a time, only for counties with AQS testing sites
# Preserve estimate columns, ditch MOE
# Join to testing site list
# Stack ACS data together in a single data frame

acs.loop <- function(){
  for (st in seq_along(lower48.codes)) {
    
    newstate <- lower48.codes[st]
    
    county.list <- tst.minimal %>% 
                  filter(STATEFP==newstate) %>% 
                  dplyr::select(COUNTYFP) %>%
                  arrange(COUNTYFP) %>%
                  as.matrix() %>% as.vector() %>% as.list()
    
    results.acs <- get_acs( geography = "tract"
                          ,variables=as.list(final.acs.var.list$name)
                          ,state = newstate
                          ,county = county.list
                          ,output = "wide")
    
    smaller.acs <- results.acs %>% dplyr::select(GEOID,matches(".*_.*E$"))
  
    linked.acs <- tst.minimal %>% 
                filter(STATEFP==newstate) %>%
                left_join(.,smaller.acs,by="GEOID")
    
    if (st==1){
      collect <- linked.acs
    } else {
      collect <- bind_rows(collect,linked.acs)
    }
  }
  return(collect)
}

testing.sites.acs <- acs.loop()
testing.sites.acs

saveRDS(testing.sites.acs, file = "testing_sites_acs.RDS")
```

With all the ACS data I need, I can create clean versions of the variables to be included in the analysis. I exclude tracts that do not have complete data for all 19 ACS-based variables or with fewer than 500 respondents in the sample (using the denominator from the set of race variables).

```{r ACS-data-cleaning, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
testing.sites.acs <- readRDS("testing_sites_acs.RDS")

I join the census tract GEOIDs to the daily PM2.5 data, and clean and summarize the PM2.5 data by tract. Tracts with fewer than 50 days of valid data are excluded.

### Results
The continuous PM2.5 outcomes show geographic variability. Some patterns are evident; very rural tracts appear to have lower levels of PM2.5 compared to urban centers; the "Rust Belt" and southern California seem to have higher PM2.5 generally; but there do not appear to be large areas within which the analyzed tracts have very consistent values.

In considering the bivariate plots, several of the associations we noted from the multivariate models are apparent. Better air quality (lower PM2.5) is associated with:
* Higher rates of recent employment (worked in past 12 months)
* Fewer workers in manufacturing
* Higher % non-Hispanic white respondents
* Lower % Black respondents
* Older median age

Other associations with better air quality for which the bivariate plots are less convincing: 
* More workers in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining 
* Fewer workers commuting by car, alone
* Higher % veterans

To explore how well these factors perform at predicting tracts with higher PM2.5, I perform 5-fold cross-validation to generate and evaluate predictions for the binary outcome for whether a tract had >10% of days above 12 mcg/m3. Four (4) approaches were assessed: 
* Logistic regression with all 19 ACS-based variables
* Logistic regression with the top 8 variables from regression analysis above
* Random forest
* Support vector machines with radial kernel

These 4 approaches performed very similarly, achieving AUCs of 0.70-0.72, with linear regression (top 8) slightly outperforming the others. 

The community characteristics identified from the American Community Survey did show some interesting relationships with PM2.5 levels, as listed above. Taken together, though, their performance at *predicting* whether a tract will have worse air quality is fair or poor. Interestingly, measures related to income, rent and mortgage amounts, and poverty turned out not to be important in the models. In future work, it would be interesting to consider population density explicitly, and possibly proximity to shipping routes, or to a known set of factory sites.
