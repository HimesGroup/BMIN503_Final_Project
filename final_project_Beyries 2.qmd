## Overview {#sec-overview}

Substance use disorder(SUD) Using the 2021 NSDUH data, this project aims to track the prevalence of substance use disorder in the adult population of the United States.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

According to the World Health Organization(WHO), mental health issues disorders have risen 13% over the past ten years. This project aims to focus on the prevalence of depression in the US. Substance abuse issues are often linked with mental health issues such as depression. It will be explored if a relationship exists between substance use and depression among individuals.

This project may be helpful to those who work in fields related to mental health, substance abuse treatment or epidemiology. The link between substance abuse and mental health disorders can often be hard to study because it can be difficult to tell if one was caused by the other and in some cases which disorder occurred first. Tracking if rates of depression and substance abuse rates are correlated over the past decade may give some insight into how common the comorbidity between these two disorders may be.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

**Data set**

The data used for this project are from the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This survey intends to collect information from US civilians aged 12 and older.

**Libraries**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library("dplyr")
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggeasy)
```

**Pre-analysis**

Before any analysis could be done, variables were identified and the data was cleaned.

```{r}
#load in data 

Today is 12/7 

#NSDUH <- load()
NSDUH <- data.frame(NSDUH)


#select data needed and rename variables
NSDUH <- NSDUH %>% select(QUESTID2 , AGE3, income, COUTYP4, txevrrcvd, 
                          txyruseadb, txyrhosov,
                          txyrresov, txyroutpt, 
                          txyrmhcop , txyremrgn, 
                          txyrdrpad, txyrprisn, txyrslfhp, 
                          txyrother, TXYROTHSP2, impweeks,
                          suicthnk, suiplanyr, ADLSI2WK,
                          auinpyr, auoptyr, amdeyr,
                          casurcvr, camhrcvr, camhprob) %>% 
  
  rename(id = QUESTID2 , age = AGE3, income = income, citysize = COUTYP4, rec_sub_trtm = txevrrcvd, 
                          sub_trtm_12mo = txyruseadb, hos_trtm = txyrhosov,
                         rehab_trtm = txyrresov, outpatient_trtm = txyroutpt, 
                        mhfacility_trtm = txyrmhcop , ER_trtm = txyremrgn, 
                        private_trtm = txyrdrpad, prison_trtm = txyrprisn, selfhelp_trtm = txyrslfhp, 
                        other_trtm = txyrother, type_other_trtm = TXYROTHSP2, num_weeks_mh = impweeks,
                        think_suicide = suicthnk, plan_suicide = suiplanyr, dep_two_weeks = ADLSI2WK,
                        hos_overnight_mh = auinpyr, outpatient_mh = auoptyr, MDE_pastyear = amdeyr,
                        think_recovered_sub = casurcvr, think_recovered_mh = camhrcvr, think_had_mh = camhprob)
```

Data cleaning consisted of keeping only respondents of age 18 or older and only those who had responded whether or not they had received any treatment for substance use issues.

Describe the data used and general methodological approach used to address the problem described in the @sec-introduction. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

## Results {#sec-results}

Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. You may refer to the @sec-methods as needed. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

## Conclusion

This the conclusion. The @sec-results can be invoked if you'd like.
