### Overview

This project will be investigating 6 month outcomes in stroke patients who are discharged from the hospital to a nursing home. We will formulate 3 models. One model will address the question: What factors predict if these patients survive to 6 months? The second model will address the question: What factors predict if these patients improve their living situation (either living at home, a relatives or a residential community) or remain in the nursing home? The third model will address the question: What factors predict their level of function? Are they dependent or not-dependent?

Faculty advisors:

Dr. Monisha Kumar, Associate Professor Department of Neurology. At first I was going to have 2 research questions about final functional outcome and final living place, which each included survival as an outcome.  After, discussing with Dr.Kumar, predicting survival on its own is an important question. Then we decided because we will be looking at survival separately, we will only investigate final functional outcome and final living place for patients who survived 6 months after discharge. In addition, Dr. Kumar helped me decide how to group the final outcomes into clinical relevant groups. 

Dr. Rebecca Hubbard, Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Todd Miano helped me in determing how to analyze the data.  Dr. Hubbard at first suggested I use multinominal regression when my original research questions had 3 categorial variables with the mlogit().  After we changed questions, she suggested multivariate linear regression with the glm() function in R. She helped me decide how to group patients and which data to remove because of incomplete outcomes or not a clear outcome.  


### Introduction 

Acute stroke is a common and highly morbid disease. Worldwide it is the second most common cause of mortality and third most common cause of disability. More than 7 million people in the United States survive a stroke each year. Improvements in acute stroke treatment such as intravenous tPA and thombectomy have greatly decreased stroke mortality and disabilty. However, there are still a large number of patients who are not candidates for these therapies due to timing of stroke onset, medical comorbidities, medications and more. When a patient is not doing well in the hospital and we predict they will end up being discharged to a nursing home, families have many questions. Key questions are often: "Will they be in a nursing home forever or only temporarily?" "Will they be dependent on others for their care?" If we knew factors associated with these poor outcomes, it would allow physicians to better council families. This would allow the families to either plan for the future expected outcomes, or in some cases the families may decide against full aggressive care and concentrate on hospice measures only.

This problem requires a bioinformatician, statistical analysis and clinical knowledge of the problem from both neurology and intensive care point of view. As a bioinformatician in training, I have the knowledge on how to access this database in order to perform a novel secondary analysis.  With statistical expertise, our team is able to appropriately model and analyse our data. Along with this we require the clinical knowledge for the scope of the problem, the clinical significance and to help trouble shoot our analysis. For example, it was discovered some final cohorts on functional status at discharge had very small cohorts.  Using expert consultation from a neurologist we determined it is appropriate to group both the recovered patients and the not-recovered but not-dependent patients together. 

In patients who are discharged to a nursing home after an acute ischemic stroke, we aimed to 1) Build clinical prediction models that can identify key in-hospital variables which determine 6 month outcome, final living place and final functional outcome.
2) Describe the preditive performance of such models using both traditional regression and random forest approaches.
3) Use an easily reproducible, open-source workflow. 

We hypothesized we would be able to develop accurate models as described above. 

### Methods
The data used comes from the International Stroke Trial (IST) database.  This trial occured in the late 1990s and had over 19,000 subjects. It took place in over 35 countries and had a disproportionally older aged patients compared to other stroke trials.  This trial occured prior to thrombolysis or thrombectomy.  Therefore, it is a good database to analyze outcomes in patients for whom these therapies either were contraindicated or for whom they did not work. There is available data on variables assessed at randomization, which occured within 48 hours of admission, early outcome at 14 days and long term outcome at 6 months. 

First, we determined how many subject were in each outcome of interest. Based on this data and some low number of patients per outcome we made decisions to group outcomes together. 

Second, we created a clean database. This database included new dependent variables.  It also changed some independent variables into factors or into new groupings or renamed them into more understandable names.  Finally we kept only independent variables that pertained to the originial acute hospital stay as we wanted to develop a prediciton model based upon intial hospital characteristics. We then made 3 databases from this database with only the specific outcome of interest (survival at 6 months, final living place, or final functional outcome).  We did this as we expected final living place and final functional outcome to have an association and we did not want that association to be taken into account by the Random Forest. 

We then began exploratory analyses and descriptive statistics.  We made histograms of age and length of stay.  We compared age versus each outcome variable.  We compared stroke type and each outcome variable.  We compared gender and each outcome variable. We compared initial blood pressure readings and each outcome variable. 

In our next step, we aimed to determine which variables are most important and should be included in our prediction models.  We did this by performing Random Forest on all included independent variables for each of the outcomes.  We then chose the top 7 independent variables accross all 3 outcomes.  We chose to use 7 independent variables as our outcome with the smallest cohort was 69 subjects. After choosing the 7 most important independent variables, we used these variables in a linear regresssion prediction model and a random forest prediction model.  We did cross validation using a K-fold method, meaning data was split into K randomly selected sub-samples. K-1 sub-samples were used for model training. One subsample was used as an independent test set. We evaulated the models with Receiver-Operating Characgteristics (ROC) and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC).

### Results
Of patients from the IST trial who were discharged to a nursing home, we found 386 survived 6 months, 69 were not dependent on others for care and 186 improved their level of living and no longer lived in a nursing home (Table 1). We found age differed between between groups in all 3 outcomes in bivariate analyses (Figure 1a, 1b, 1c).  We found stroke type differed between all outcomes with Total Anterior Stroke having worse outcomes (Figure 2a, 2b, 2c).  We found males were more likely to have improved outcomes in bivariate analyses (Figure 3a, 3b, 3c).

Our Random Forest model using all independent variables gave 4 variables, which consistently had the highest importance for each outcome: Age, length of hospital stay, systolic blood pressure at randomization and stroke type. Other variables that were of high importance were consciousness at time of randomization, dysphagia symptoms and sex. These 7 variables were used in the final models. 

####Model Evaulation:

#####6 month Survival
All models predicting 6 month survival had a moderate to fair performance (Figure 4a,4b)(Table 2). The Logistic Regression model using top variables performed slightly better than other models with an AUC of 0.67. There is evidence for overfitting in both models of random forests as shown by the large difference between the AUC of the training versus testing data. Age, Total Anterior Stroke, No/Unknown Dysphagia were all significantly associated with increase chance of dying, while increased hospital length of stay and full consciousness at time of randomization where significantly associated with surviving at 6 months. Table 3 shows the p values for these variables. 

#####Final Living Place
All models predicting 6 month survival had moderate performance (Figure 5a,5b)(Table 4). The Logistic Regression model using top variables again performed slightly better than other models with an AUC of 0.7135. There is evidence for overfitting in both models of random forests as shown by the large difference between the AUC of the training versus testing data. Age, hospital length of stay, total anterior stroke, no/unknown dysphagia were all significantly associated with remaining in a nursing home in the logistic regression model (Table 5).

#####Final Functional OUtcome
All models predicting 6 month survival had a moderate to fair performance (Figure 6a,6b)(Table 6). The Logistic Regression model using top variables again performed slightly better than other models with an AUC of 0.71. There is evidence for overfitting in both models of random forests as shown by the large difference between the AUC of the training versus testing data. Increased hospital length of stay and total anterior stroke were both significantly associated with being in a dependent state in the logistic regression model (Table 7).

###Conclusions
For ischemic stroke patients who are discharged to a nursing home after a stroke were able to develop prediction models for 6 month outcomes of survival, final living place and functional outcome.  For all outcomes the logistic regression models using top variables slightly outperformed the other models.  Considering the multitude of factors the subjects are exposed to between hospital discharge and 6 month outcomes, it would be very difficult to have a highly predictive model using only in-hospital variables.  We therefor are satisfied with the moderate performance of our models. Future directions would be to apply and test this model on future stroke populations that were not able to receive thrombectomy or thrombolysis.
