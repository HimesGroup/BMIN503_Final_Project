AB Remote monitoring (RM) has become a new standard of care in the follow-up of patients with implantable pacemakers and defibrillators. While it has been consistently shown that RM enables earlier detection of clinically actionable events compared with traditional in-patient evaluation, this advantage did not translate into improved patient outcomes in clinical trials of RM except one study using daily multiparameter telemonitoring in heart failure (HF) patients. Therefore, this review, focusing on RM studies of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators in patients with HF, discusses possible explanations for the differences in trial outcomes. Patient selection may play an important role as more severe HF and concomitant atrial fibrillation have been associated with improved outcomes by RM. Furthermore, the technical set-up of RM may have an important impact as a higher level of connectivity with more frequent data transmission can be linked to better outcomes. Finally, there is growing evidence as to the need of effective algorithms ensuring a fast and well-structured clinical response to the events detected by RM. These factors re-emphasize the potential of remote management of device patients with HF and call for continued clinical research and technical development in the field. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: A clinically practical, brief, user-friendly, multi-domain self-report and caregiver-report tool is needed for tracking actionable symptoms in primary care for elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs).; OBJECTIVE: Develop and assess usability, administration time, and internal reliability of SymTrak.; DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase I: legacy instruments, content validity, analyses of existing data, focus groups (physicians, nurses, patients, informal caregivers), and Think Aloud interviews (patients, caregivers) were used to develop SymTrak. Phase II (pilot feasibility study): 81 (27 patient-caregiver dyads, 27 patients without an identified caregiver) participants were self-administered SymTrak in clinic.; MAIN MEASURES: SymTrak and demographic questions.; KEY RESULTS: Consistent themes emerged from phase I focus groups. Ambiguous wording was corrected with Think Aloud feedback. In phase II, patients and caregivers preferred circling words instead of numbers for item response options. SymTrak self-administration completion time in clinic was brief; mean was 2.4, 3.0, and 3.3min for the finalized circlingwords version, respectively, for caregivers, dyadic patients, and patients without a caregiver; and the maximum was 6.2min for any participant. Usability questionnaire ratings were high. Cronbach's alpha for the SymTrak 23-item total score was 0.86, 0.79, and 0.81 for caregivers, dyadic patients, and patients without a caregiver, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: SymTrak demonstrates content validity, positive qualitative findings, high perceived usability, brief self-administered completion time, and good internal reliability.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel analysis on DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is increasingly used to also identify actionable copy number gains (gene amplifications) in addition to sequence variants. While guidelines for the reporting of sequence variants are available, guidance with respect to reporting copy number gains from gene-panel NGS data is limited. Here, we report on Dutch consensus recommendations obtained in the context of the national Predictive Analysis for THerapy (PATH) project, which aims to optimize and harmonize routine diagnostics in molecular pathology. We briefly discuss two common approaches to detect gene copy number gains from NGS data, i.e., the relative coverage and B-allele frequencies. In addition, we provide recommendations for reporting gene copy gains for clinical purposes. In addition to general QC metrics associated with NGS in routine diagnostics, it is recommended to include clinically relevant quantitative parameters of copy number gains in the clinical report, such as (i) relative coverage and estimated copy numbers in neoplastic cells, (ii) statistical scores to show significance (e.g., z-scores), and (iii) the sensitivity of the assay and restrictions of NGS-based detection of copy number gains. Collectively, this information can guide clinical and analytical decisions such as the reliable detection of high-level gene amplifications and the requirement for additional in situ assays in case of borderline results or limited sensitivity.

AB Objective: To report the rate of candidate actionable somatic mutations in patients with locally advanced and metastatic gastro-enteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and of other genetic alterations that may be associated with tumorigenesis. Methods: A phase II mutation targeted therapy trial was conducted in patients with advanced well-differentiated G1/G2 GEP-NET. Mutations found in the mTOR pathway-associated genes led to treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, and were defined as actionable. Tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from GEP-NET were sequenced and compared with germline DNA, using the OncoVAR-NET assay, designed for hybrid capture sequencing of 500 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Somatic variants were called and copy-number (CN) variant analysis was performed. Results: Thirty patients (14 small-intestine, 8 pancreatic, 3 unknown primary NET, and 5 of other primary sites) harbored 37 lesions (4 patients had DNA of multiple lesions sequenced). Only 2 patients with sporadic NET (n = 26) had an actionable mutation leading to treatment with everolimus. Driver somatic mutations were detected in 18 of 30 patients (21/37 lesions sequenced). In the remaining samples without a driver mutation, CN alterations were found in 11/16 tumors (10/12 patients), including CN loss of chromosome (Chr) 18 (P<.05), CN gain of Chr 5, and loss of Chr 13. CN losses in Chr 18 were more common in patients without driver mutations detected. Pronounced genetic heterogeneity was detected in patients with multiple lesions sequenced. Conclusion: Genome-wide DNA sequencing may identify candidate actionable genes and lead to the identification of novel target genes for advanced well-differentiated GEP-NET. Abbreviations: Chr = chromosome; CN = copy number; DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; GEP = gastro-enteropancreatic; MEN-1 = multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; NET = neuroendocrine tumor; PFS = progression-free survival; PNET = pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; SINET = small-intestine neuroendocrine tumor.

AB Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms and can be transmitted between individuals and populations thus threatening the general public health and potentially the economy. Efficient diagnostic tools are needed to provide accurate and timely guidance for case identification, transmission disruption and appropriate treatment administration. Point of care (POC) tests provide actionable results near the patient and thereby serve as a personal "radar". In this review, we review clinical needs for POC testing for several major pathogens, including malaria parasites, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), dengue, Ebola and Zika viruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). We compare different molecular approaches, including pathogen nucleic acid and protein, circulating microRNA and antibodies, used in the POC tests. Finally, we review recent advances in novel POC technologies focusing on microfluidic and plasmonic-based approaches. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of a standardized, age-based metric for scoring clinical actionability to evaluate conditions for inclusion in newborn screening and compare it with the results from other contemporary methods.; STUDY DESIGN: The North Carolina Newborn Exome Sequencing for Universal Screening study developed an age-based, semiquantitative metric to assess the clinical actionability of gene-disease pairs and classify them with respect to age of onset or timing of interventions. This categorization was compared with the gold standard Recommended Uniform Screening Panel and other methods to evaluate gene-disease pairs for newborn genomic sequencing.; RESULTS: We assessed 822 gene-disease pairs, enriched for pediatric onset of disease and suspected actionability. Of these, 466 were classified as having childhood onset and high actionability, analogous to conditions selected for the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel core panel. Another 245 were classified as having childhood onset and low to no actionability, 25 were classified as having adult onset and high actionability, 19 were classified as having adult onset and low to no actionability, and 67 were excluded due to controversial evidence and/or prenatal onset.; CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel method to facilitate decisions about the potential use of genomic sequencing for newborn screening. These categories may assist parents and physicians in making informed decisions about the disclosure of results from voluntary genomic sequencing in children. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest cancers because it is highly resistant to every available therapeutic strategy, in particular conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy (RT). Sensitizing tumor cells to existing treatments remains a good option to obtain fast and applicable results. Considering that ionizing radiations induce radiolysis-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesized that ROS-inducing bioactive food components (BFCs) could exacerbate ROS-related cell damages, including DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs), leaving the cellular ROS scavenging systems overwhelmed, and precipitating tumor cell death. Combination of resveratrol and capsaicin radiosensitized radiosensitive tumor cells, but RT did not increase BFC combination toxicity in radioresistant tumor cells. BFC addition to RT increased ROS production and led to significant tumor volume reduction in xenografted mouse preclinical model. Strikingly, BFCs inhibited RT-induced DNA damage molecular response by strongly limiting the first steps of DSB repair, and by keeping cells in cell cycle, provoking exacerbated intrinsic apoptosis. This study positions BFCs as potent radiosensitizers when combined, and identifies an actionable molecular pathway by resveratrol and capsaicin combination. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUND: In the United States, patients who have breast cancer experience significant economic burden compared with those who have other types of cancers. Cancer-related economic burden is exacerbated by adverse treatment effects. Strategies to resolve the economic burden caused by breast cancer and its adverse treatment effects have stemmed from the perspectives of health care providers, oncology navigators, and other subject-matter experts. For the current study, patient-driven recommendations were elicited to reduce economic burden after 1) breast cancer and 2) breast cancer-related lymphedema, which is a common, persistent adverse effect of breast cancer.; METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 40 long-term breast cancer survivors who were residents of Pennsylvania or New Jersey in 2015 and were enrolled in a 6-month observational study. Purposive sampling ensured equal representation by age, socioeconomic position, and lymphedema diagnosis. Semistructured interviews addressed economic challenges, supports used, and patient recommendations for reducing financial challenges. Interviews were coded, and representative quotes from the patient recommendations were analyzed and reported to illustrate key findings.; RESULTS: Of 40 interviewees (mean age, 64years; mean time since diagnosis, 12years), 27 offered recommendations to reduce the economic burden caused by cancer and its adverse treatment effects. Nine recommendations emerged across 4 major themes: expanding affordable insurance and insurance-covered items, especially for lymphedema treatment (among the 60% who reported lymphedema); supportive domestic help; financial assistance from diagnosis through treatment; and employment-preserving policies.; CONCLUSIONS: The current study yielded 9 actionable, patient-driven recommendations-changes to insurance, supportive services, financial assistance, and protective policies-to reduce breast cancer-related economic burden. These recommendations should be tested through policy and programmatic interventions. © 2019 The Authors. Cancer published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Cancer Society.

AB PURPOSE: Rates of organ donation vary between otherwise comparable intensive care units (ICUs) suggesting that the process of donation must vary between ICUs. The purpose of this study was to describe the process of organ donation from the perspective of ICU staff, identify important drivers of successful donation, and develop strategies to improve the process of donation.; METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 32 ICU staff, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, using an interview guide developed from previous studies on organ donation. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, we coded interviews using qualitative content analysis. We integrated findings from the interviews in a mixed-methods analysis with previously published data from a document analysis and cross-sectional survey to identify practices that may enhance organ donation in the ICU.; RESULTS: Five major themes important to the organ donation process emerged from the interviews: i) staff relationship with organ donation coordinators; ii) standardized processes; iii) ICU staff beliefs; iv) integration of donation and high quality end-of-life care; v) feedback and staff support. In the mixed-methods analysis, we identified 22 actionable practices to enhance the process of organ donation in the ICU.; CONCLUSION: Incorporating the perspectives of ICU staff, we were able to identify 22 practice changes that may have a significant cumulative impact on donation outcomes. Future research is required to evaluate whether these findings account for the variability of donation rates between otherwise comparable ICUs.

AB The mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) gene is altered and becomes a driver mutation in up to 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report our institutional experience treating patients with MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations, including responses to the MET inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib. We identified cases of NSCLC with METex14 mutations using an institutionally developed or commercial next-generation sequencing assay. We assessed patient and disease characteristics by retrospective chart review. Some patients were treated off-label by the physician with crizotinib or cabozantinib, and tumor responses to these agents were assessed. A total of 15 patients with METex14-mutated NSCLC were identified, predominantly male (n=10) with a smoking history (60%) and a median age of 74.0 years. No other actionable somatic mutations were detected. Stage distribution included 26.7% stage I, 6.7% stage II, 6.7% stage III, and 60.0% stage IV. Among patients treated with crizotinib or cabozantinib (n=6), three patients showed partial response and one patient showed stable disease on the basis of RECIST criteria. Four patients experienced side effects requiring drug holiday, reduction, or cessation. Our findings highlight the diversity in presentation and histology of NSCLC with METex14 mutations, which were found in the absence of other actionable driver mutations. We observed evidence of tumor response to crizotinib and cabozantinib, supporting the previous reports that METex14 mutations in NSCLC are actionable driver events.

AB BACKGROUND: Spanish-speaking Hispanics living in the United States utilize the internet as a primary means to obtain health information. Accurate, accessible information is important for English speakers; however, it could have even greater utility for Spanish speakers who have lower health literacy levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare online English and Spanish carpal tunnel surgery materials provided by using a multimetric approach.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web search using the English term "carpal tunnel surgery" was performed. The first 10 institutional/organizational websites that provided carpal tunnel surgery information in English and Spanish were included. All relevant online materials were evaluated using the Patient Education and Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), Cultural Sensitivity Assessment Tool (CSAT), and Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook, Spanish (SOL) to assess understandability and actionability, cultural sensitivity, and readability, respectively.; RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in understandability or actionability scores between Spanish and English materials. Average cultural sensitivity scores for Spanish materials were significantly lower than English materials (P=0.015). The average reading grade level of online English materials was greater than that for Spanish materials (P=0.011). Both mean values were above the recommended sixth-grade reading level.; CONCLUSIONS: Online patient-directed information regarding carpal tunnel surgery exceeded the recommended reading grade level for both English and Spanish-speaking populations. Most Spanish materials were often direct translations and were not contoured to the elevated literacy needs of this demographic. Institutions must caution their authors to tailor their web material in a way that is sensitive to their target population to optimize understanding. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In India, 90% of the rural population is estimated to lack access to safe, affordable, and timely surgical care. Surgical care in these settings is often characterized by limited resources. Provision of rural surgical care often requires novel approaches as compared to those in higher income urban sectors, specifically in areas of infrastructure, workforce, and blood. This consensus statement draws upon the wealth of experience held by India's rural surgeons to identify key problems and lay forth actionable solutions in the areas of surgical infrastructure, workforce, and blood supply.

AB INTRODUCTION: The ongoing challenge for Chilean hospitals of meeting population health needs merits attention to the health care workforce. No studies have explored how nursing might contribute to addressing this challenge. International research shows that organizational characteristics of the nursing workforce and practice environment are associated with patient outcomes. Chile lacks actionable evidence that applies to its context of care.; METHOD: First, a review of international literature was developed to synthesize evidence on the association between organizational characteristics of the nursing workforce and patient outcomes. Second, a review of literature and other nonacademic sources was performed to describe the context of care and data pertaining to nurses in Chilean hospitals. Third, a research agenda for efficient utilization of the hospital nursing workforce in Chile was proposed.; RESULTS: International evidence shows that low patient-to-nurse ratios, high skill mix, and good practice environments are associated with better patient outcomes. Chilean hospitals have financial constraints that greatly influence the context of nursing practice and the scarce data about nursing organization call for greater attention.; CONCLUSION: The establishment and implementation of a research agenda is needed to build local evidence regarding effective organization of nurses to inform policies and to improve patient outcomes in Chile.

AB The cost-effectiveness of testing for multiple genes implicated in adverse drug reactions requires the simultaneous assessment of all actionable information, including future prescribing decisions based on incidental findings. We developed methodology for determining the value of pharmacogenetic panel tests, illustrated with a multigene panel, including HLA-A*31:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*57:01, HLA-B*58:01, HLA-B (158T), and HLA-DQB1 (126Q). If the findings for all alleles are acted upon, regardless of their individual cost-effectiveness, the HLA panel resulted in cost savings of 378 (US $491), and a quality-adjusted life year gain of 0.0069. Based on a stratified analysis and compared with no testing, initial use of the panel was cost-effective in patients eligible for abacavir (HLA-B*57:01), carbamazepine (HLA-A*31:01), and clozapine (HLA-B (158T) and HLA-DQB1 (126Q)), but not for carbamazepine (HLA-B*15:02) or allopurinol (HLA-B*58:01). The methods presented allow for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of multiple-gene panels. © 2018 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2018 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB BACKGROUND: Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy that can cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of PC might identify genomic alterations (GAs), which would suggest benefit from rationally matched therapeutics.; METHODS: We performed hybrid-capture-based CGP to identify GAs and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in tumors from patients with this malignancy.; RESULTS: There were 85 total GAs in 16 cases (5.3 GAs per case), and the median TMB was 1.7 mutations per megabase (m/Mb), with three cases having >20 m/Mb (18.7%). The genes most frequently harboring GA were CDC73 (38%), TP53 (38%), and MEN1 (31%). All MEN1-mutated cases also had loss of heterozygosity at that locus, but in contrast all CDC73-mutated cases retained heterozygosity. GAs suggesting potential benefit from matched targeted therapy were identified in 11 patients (69%) and most frequently found in PTEN (25%), NF1 (12.5%), KDR (12.5%), PIK3CA (12.5%), and TSC2 (12.5%). A patient whose tumor harbored KDR T668 K and who was treated with cabozantinib experienced a > 50% drop in parathyroid hormone level and radiographic partial response of 5.4 months with duration limited by toxicity.; CONCLUSION: CGP identified GAs in PC that suggest benefit from targeted therapy, as supported by an index case of response to a matched tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Moreover, the unexpectedly high frequency of high TMB (>20 m/Mb) suggests a subset of PC may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy that can cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. However, its molecular characteristics remain unclear, with few systemic therapeutic options available for this tumor. Hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling of 16 primary cancers demonstrated presence of potentially actionable genomic alterations, including PTEN, NF1, KDR, PIK3CA, and TSC2, and a subset of hypermutated cancers with more than 20 mutations per megabase, the latter of which could benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. A case benefiting from rationally matched targeted therapy for activating KDR mutation is also presented. These findings should be further investigated for their therapeutic potential. © AlphaMed Press 2018.

AB With the development of next generation sequencing, beyond identifying the cause of manifestations that justified prescription of the test, other information with potential interest for patients and their families, defined as secondary findings (SF), can be provided once patients have given informed consent, in particular when therapeutic and preventive options are available. The disclosure of such findings has caused much debate. The aim of this work was to summarize all opinion-based studies focusing on SF, so as to shed light on the concerns that this question generate. A review of the literature was performed, focusing on all PubMed articles reporting qualitative, quantitative or mixed studies that interviewed healthcare providers, participants, or society regarding this subject. The methodology was carefully analysed, in particular whether or not studies made the distinction between actionable and non-actionable SF, in a clinical or research context. From 2010 to 2016, 39 articles were compiled. A total of 14,868 people were interviewed (1259 participants, 6104 healthcare providers, 7505 representatives of society). When actionable and non-actionable SF were distinguished (20 articles), 92% of respondents were keen to have results regarding actionable SF (participants: 88%, healthcare providers: 86%, society: 97%), against 70% (participants: 83%, healthcare providers: 62%, society: 73%) for non-actionable SF. These percentages were slightly lower in the specific situation of children probands. For respondents, the notion of the patient's choice is crucial. For healthcare providers, the importance of defining policies for SF among diagnostic lab, learning societies and/or countries is outlined, in particular regarding the content and extension of the list of actionable genes to propose, the modalities of information, and the access to information about adult-onset diseases in minors. However, the existing literature should be taken with caution, since most articles lack a clear definition of SF and actionability, and referred to hypothetical scenarios with limited information to respondents. Studies conducted by multidisciplinary teams involving patients with access to results are sadly lacking, in particular in the medium term after the results have been given. Such studies would feed the debate and make it possible to measure the impact of such findings and their benefit-risk ratio. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB After lung cancer, breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cause of cancer death among women, worldwide. Although advances in screening approaches and targeted therapeutic agents have decreased BC incidence and mortality, over the past five years, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains the breast cancer subtype that displays the worst prognosis, mainly due to the lack of clinically actionable targets. Genetic and molecular profiling has unveiled the high intrinsic heterogeneity of TNBC, with the basal-like molecular subtypes representing the most diffuse TNBC subtypes, characterized by the expression of basal epithelial markers, such as the transcription factor p63. In this review, we will provide a broad picture on the physiological role of p63, in maintaining the basal epithelial identity, as well as its involvement in breast cancer progression, emphasizing its relevance in tumor cell invasion and stemness.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify key questions for emergency medicine (EM)-based adolescent sexual and reproductive health and to develop an evidence-based research agenda.; METHODS: We recruited national content experts to serve as advisory group members and used a modified Delphi technique to develop consensus around actionable research questions related to EM-based adolescent reproductive and sexual health care. Author subgroups conducted literature reviews and developed the initial list of research questions, which were iteratively refined with advisory members. External stakeholders then independently rated each item for its importance in expanding the evidence base (1=not important to 5=very important) via electronic survey.; RESULTS: Our final list of 24 research questions included items that intersected all sexual and reproductive health topics as well as questions specific to human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted infections (HIV/STIs), pregnancy prevention, confidentiality/consent, public health, and barriers and facilitators to care. External stakeholders rated items related to HIV/STI, cost-effectiveness, brief intervention for sexual risk reduction, and implementation and dissemination as most important.; CONCLUSIONS: We identified critical questions to inform EM-based adolescent sexual and reproductive health research. Because evidence-based care has potential to improve health outcomes while reducing costs associated with HIV/STI and unintended pregnancy, funders and researchers should consider increasing attention to these key questions. © 2019 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

AB We review current applications of Big Data in diabetes care and consider the future potential by carrying out a scoping study of the academic literature on Big Data and diabetes care. Healthcare data are being produced at ever-increasing rates, and this information has the potential to transform the provision of diabetes care. Big Data is beginning to have an impact on diabetes care through data research. The use of Big Data for routine clinical care is still a future application. Vast amounts of healthcare data are already being produced, and the key is harnessing these to produce actionable insights. Considerable development work is required to achieve these goals. © 2019 Diabetes UK.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to identify and evaluate scientific evidence examining the impact of the built environment on patient falls in hospital rooms.; METHODS: An integrative review (IR) with a systematic literature search was performed using the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome framework. We searched CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMED, and Web of Science databases. The search included peer-reviewed studies from 1990 to 2017 written in English. An additional hand search was also conducted. Selected articles were reviewed and rated based on a hierarchical categorization, comprising six evidence levels, developed by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses and adapted for evidence-based design systematic literature reviews.; RESULTS: After a multitiered process, 30 articles met the selection criteria. Thematic areas were created based on the examined elements of the physical environment including patient room configuration and available space, bathroom configuration, bathtub and shower, door, bed height and bed rail, flooring, floor mats, patient chair, lighting, toilet, handrail, grab bars, intravenous pole, sink, ceiling lift, and wheelchair and walking aids. Findings of studies on each element are discussed in detail.; CONCLUSIONS: Some environmental elements have not been examined in past relational or causal studies, and the level of evidence for the examined attributes is not high enough to gain robust confidence in healthcare design decision-making. Because of the low level of evidence for several environmental elements, conclusions must be taken with caution. More studies using quantitative, relational, or causal designs are recommended to develop actionable interventions on patient falls in hospital rooms.

AB To increase diagnostic efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we performed an exploratory genetic test using a newly designed panel containing 28 actionable and druggable genes, alterations in which are frequently reported in gynecological cancers (TANRE-G, Targeted variants ANalysis RElated to Gynecological cancers). Samples consisted of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of endometrial (4 cases), cervical (3 cases), and ovarian (4 cases) carcinomas. The sequencing procedure was performed using Ion PGM in our institute with related sequencing kits, and data were analyzed using ClinVar. The present system achieved more than 2500 reads in all tumor samples, and enabled a copy number variation analysis. Results showed that actionable and druggable mutations were detected in 82% (9/11) and 64% (7/11) of cases, respectively, which was similar to other commercially available genetic tests. The amplification of MYC and KRAS was also detected. The analysis cost for each sample was JPY 94,000 (USD 850). These results demonstrate the potential of the TANRE-G panel as an effective tool for examining genetic alterations in gynecological cancers.

AB The recognition over the past decade that nearly all diseases are associated with changes in the microbiome has raised hope that microbiome-based therapeutics may cure many human ailments. Billions of dollars are being poured into microbiome-oriented biotech companies, and the coming years will undoubtedly witness the approval of the first generation of these products. However, significant hurdles remain in expanding the pipeline and advancing these first-generation therapies. In this perspective, I will discuss the challenges related to identifying causal microbes, determining their mechanism of action, and characterizing the specific bacterial molecules required for disease protection. We are approaching these issues through a combination of clinical sampling, animal models, classic microbiology methodologies, and systems-based approaches. The field of microbiome research is on the cusp of being able to identify clinically actionable host-microbe relationships; increasing attention on identifying causal microbes and their bioactive factors will usher in the next generation of microbiome-based therapies.

AB RATIONALE: The impact of neuroscience-based approaches for psychiatry on pragmatic clinical decision-making has been limited. Although neuroscience has provided insights into basic mechanisms of neural function, these insights have not improved the ability to generate better assessments, prognoses, diagnoses, or treatment of psychiatric conditions.; OBJECTIVES: To integrate the emerging findings in machine learning and computational psychiatry to address the question: what measures that are not derived from the patient's self-assessment or the assessment by a trained professional can be used to make more precise predictions about the individual's current state, the individual's future disease trajectory, or the probability to respond to a particular intervention?; RESULTS: Currently, the ability to use individual differences to predict differential outcomes is very modest possibly related to the fact that the effect sizes of interventions are small. There is emerging evidence of genetic and neuroimaging-based heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders, which contributes to imprecise predictions. Although the use of machine learning tools to generate clinically actionable predictions is still in its infancy, these approaches may identify subgroups enabling more precise predictions. In addition, computational psychiatry might provide explanatory disease models based on faulty updating of internal values or beliefs.; CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for larger studies, clinical trials using machine learning, or computational psychiatry model parameters predictions as actionable outcomes, comparing alternative explanatory computational models, and using translational approaches that apply similar paradigms and models in humans and animals.

AB BACKGROUND: Anti-PD1/PD-L1 directed immune-checkpoint-inhibitors (ICI) are widely used to treat patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The activity of ICI across NSCLC harboring oncogenic alterations is poorly characterized. The aim of our study was to address the efficacy of ICI in the context of oncogenic addiction.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for patients receiving ICI monotherapy for advanced NSCLC with at least one oncogenic driver alteration. Anonymized data were evaluated for clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes for ICI therapy: best response (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was PFS under ICI. Secondary endpoints were best response (RECIST 1.1) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation.; RESULTS: We studied 551 patients treated in 24 centers from 10 countries. The molecular alterations involved KRAS (n=271), EGFR (n=125), BRAF (n=43), MET (n=36), HER2 (n=29), ALK (n=23), RET (n=16), ROS1 (n=7), and multiple drivers (n=1). Median age was 60 years, gender-ratio was 1:1, never/former/current smokers were 28/51/21% respectively, and the majority of tumors were adenocarcinoma. The objective response rate by driver alteration was: KRAS=26%, BRAF=24%, ROS1=17%, MET=16%, EGFR=12%, HER2=7%, RET=6%, ALK=0%. In the entire cohort, median PFS was 2.8 months, OS 13.3 months and the best response rate 19%. In a subgroup analysis, median PFS (in months) was 2.1 for EGFR, 3.2 for KRAS, 2.5 for ALK, 3.1 for BRAF, 2.5 for HER2, 2.1 for RET, and 3.4 for MET. In certain subgroups, PFS was positively associated with PD-L1 expression (KRAS, EGFR) and with smoking status (BRAF, HER2).; CONCLUSIONS: ICI induced regression in some tumors with actionable driver alterations, but clinical activity was lower compared to the KRAS group and the lack of response in the ALK group was notable. Patients with actionable tumor alterations should receive targeted therapies and chemotherapy before considering immunotherapy. © The Author 2019.

AB Whole-genome sequencing is increasingly adopted in clinical settings to identify pathogen transmissions, though largely as a retrospective tool. Prospective monitoring, in which samples are continuously added and compared to previous samples, can generate more actionable information. To enable prospective pathogen comparison, genomic relatedness metrics based on single-nucleotide differences must be consistent across time, efficient to compute and reliable for a large variety of samples. The choice of genomic regions to compare, i.e., the core genome, is critical to obtain a good metric. We propose a novel core genome method that selects conserved sequences in the reference genome by comparing its k-mer content to that of publicly available genome assemblies. The conserved-sequence genome is sample set-independent, which enables prospective pathogen monitoring. Based on clinical data sets of 3436 S. aureus, 1362 K. pneumoniae and 348 E. faecium samples, ROC curves demonstrate that the conserved-sequence genome disambiguates same-patient samples better than a core genome consisting of conserved genes. The conserved-sequence genome confirms outbreak samples with high sensitivity: in a set of 2335 S. aureus samples, it correctly identifies 44 out of 44 known outbreak samples, whereas the conserved-gene method confirms 38 known outbreak samples.

AB Tumor immunology has changed the landscape of cancer treatment. Yet, not all patients benefit as cancer immune responsiveness (CIR) remains a limitation in a considerable proportion of cases. The multifactorial determinants of CIR include the genetic makeup of the patient, the genomic instability central to cancer development, the evolutionary emergence of cancer phenotypes under the influence of immune editing, and external modifiers such as demographics, environment, treatment potency, co-morbidities and cancer-independent alterations including immune homeostasis and polymorphisms in the major and minor histocompatibility molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Based on the premise that cancer is fundamentally a disorder of the genes arising within a cell biologic process, whose deviations from normality determine the rules of engagement with the host's response, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a task force of experts from various disciplines including, immunology, oncology, biophysics, structural biology, molecular and cellular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics to address the complexity of CIR from a holistic view. The task force was launched by a workshop held in San Francisco on May 14-15, 2018 aimed at two preeminent goals: 1) to identify the fundamental questions related to CIR and 2) to create an interactive community of experts that could guide scientific and research priorities by forming a logical progression supported by multiple perspectives to uncover mechanisms of CIR. This workshop was a first step toward a second meeting where the focus would be to address the actionability of some of the questions identified by working groups. In this event, five working groups aimed at defining a path to test hypotheses according to their relevance to human cancer and identifying experimental models closest to human biology, which include: 1) Germline-Genetic, 2) Somatic-Genetic and 3) Genomic-Transcriptional contributions to CIR, 4) Determinant(s) of Immunogenic Cell Death that modulate CIR, and 5) Experimental Models that best represent CIR and its conversion to an immune responsive state. This manuscript summarizes the contributions from each group and should be considered as a first milestone in the path toward a more contemporary understanding of CIR. We appreciate that this effort is far from comprehensive and that other relevant aspects related to CIR such as the microbiome, the individual's recombined T cell and B cell receptors, and the metabolic status of cancer and immune cells were not fully included.

AB Given the rapidly decreasing cost and increasing speed and accessibility of massively parallel technologies, the integration of comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data into a "multi-omics" diagnostic pipeline is within reach. Even though genomic analysis has the capability to reveal all possible perturbations in our genetic code, analysis typically reaches a diagnosis in just 35% of cases, with a diagnostic gap arising due to limitations in prioritization and interpretation of detected variants. Here we review the utility of complementing genetic data with transcriptomic data and give a perspective for the introduction of proteomics into the diagnostic pipeline. Together these methodologies enable comprehensive capture of the functional consequence of variants, unobtainable by the analysis of each methodology in isolation. This facilitates functional annotation and reprioritization of candidate genes and variants-a promising approach to shed light on the underlying molecular cause of a patient's disease, increasing diagnostic rate, and allowing actionability in clinical practice. © 2019 SSIEM.

AB BACKGROUND: Nurses must balance their perceived duty to care against their perceived risk of harm to determine their willingness to report during disaster events, potentially creating an ethical dilemma and impacting patient care.; RESEARCH AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate nurses' perceived duty to care and whether there were differences in willingness to respond during disaster events based on perceived levels of duty to care.; RESEARCH DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey research design was used in this study.; PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Using a convenience sample with a snowball technique, data were collected from 289 nurses throughout the United States in 2017. Participants were recruited through host university websites, Facebook, and an American Nurses Association discussion board.; ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Institutional review board approval was obtained from the University of Texas at Tyler and the University of Arkansas.; FINDINGS: Analysis of willingness to report to work based on levels of perceived duty to care resulted in the emergence of two groups: "lower level of perceived duty to care group" and "higher level of perceived duty to care group." The most discriminating characteristics differentiating the groups included fear of abandonment by co-workers, reporting because it is morally the right thing to, and because of imperatives within the Nursing Code of Ethics.; DISCUSSION: The number of nurses in the lower level of perceived duty to care group causes concern. It is important for nursing management to develop strategies to advance nurses' safety, minimize nurses' risk, and promote nurses' knowledge to confidently work during disaster situations.; CONCLUSION: Level of perceived duty to care affects nurses' willingness to report to work during disasters. Primary indicators of low perceived duty to care are amenable to actionable strategies, potentially increasing nurses' perceived duty to provide care and willingness to report to work during disasters.

AB BACKGROUND: More patients are now taking high-risk medicines such as non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Hence, patient education materials need to be in an understandable format so that they can be empowered to act on their knowledge. Factors such as health literacy and the design of the medicine information material may influence the patient's ability to understand and act on key information.; METHOD: The PRISMA checklist was used to inform the study design. A structured search was conducted to obtain all freely accessible online educational resources designed for patients about the non-vitamin K antagonists (NOACs) during August 2018. Three search engines were used: Google, Yahoo! and Bing, using the search terms "NOAC" and "anticoagulant" combined with "patient/consumer information and patient/consumer resources." We applied the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) to evaluate web-based patient education materials in terms of understandability and actionability for patients taking NOACs.; RESULTS: Of the 35 materials included, the majority of the materials (n = 32, 91%) were rated as highly understandable (PEMAT score ≥70%), and more than three-quarters of all the materials (n = 29, 83%) were rated as poorly actionable (PEMAT score <70%). For understandability, the majority of materials neither provided a summary of the key points nor used visual aids for several items such as simple tables, illustrations, and photographs. For actionability, few materials provided a tangible tool, such as a checklist, to prompt the user into action (n = 4). Few used visual aids such as nonverbal cues to the written instructions (n = 4).; CONCLUSION: To improve the understandability and actionability of most of the NOAC patient education materials, there is a need to include more summaries of information, visual aids, and tangible tools such as checklists. Further research is warranted where patients are involved in providing feedback on the design of medicine information materials for NOACs.

AB BACKGROUND: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an environmental accounting tool aimed at determining environmental impacts of products, processes, or organizational activities over the entire life cycle. Although this technique already provides decision-makers in other sectors with valuable information, its application in the health care setting has not yet been examined.; PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of scientific research on the application of LCA in hospitals and its contribution to management decision-making.; METHOD: We perform a systematic literature review by searching a range of databases with synonyms of "LCA" in combination with the term "hospital" in order to identify peer-reviewed studies. The final sample of 43 studies were then subjected to a content analysis.; RESULTS: We categorize existing research and show that single and multi-indicator LCA approaches are used to examine several products and processes in hospitals. The various approaches are favored by different scientific communities. Whereas researchers from environmental sciences perform complex multi-indicator LCA studies, researchers from health care sciences focus on footprints. The studies compare alternatives and identify environmental impacts and harmful hotspots.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: LCA results can support health care managers' traditional decision-making by providing environmental information. With this additional information regarding the environmental impacts of products and processes, managers can implement organizational changes to improve their environmental performance. Furthermore, they can influence upstream and downstream activities. However, we recommend more transdisciplinary cooperation for LCA studies and to place more focus on actionable recommendations when publishing the results.

AB PURPOSE: Genetic testing for cancer risk has expanded rapidly. We examined clinical genetic testing and results among population-based patients with breast and ovarian cancer.; METHODS: The study included all women 20 years of age or older diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2014 and reported to the SEER registries covering the entire state populations. SEER data were linked to results from four laboratories that performed nearly all germline cancer genetic testing. Testing use and results were analyzed at the gene level.; RESULTS: There were 77,085 patients with breast cancer and 6,001 with ovarian cancer. Nearly one quarter of those with breast cancer (24.1%) and one third of those with ovarian cancer (30.9%) had genetic test results. Among patients with ovarian cancer, testing was lower in blacks (21.6%; 95% CI, 18.1% to 25.4%; v whites, 33.8%; 95% CI, 32.3% to 35.3%) and uninsured patients (20.8%; 95% CI, 15.5% to 26.9%; v insured patients, 35.3%; 95% CI, 33.8% to 36.9%). Prevalent pathogenic variants in patients with breast cancer were BRCA1 (3.2%), BRCA2 (3.1%), CHEK 2 (1.6%), PALB2 (1.0%), ATM (0.7%), and NBN (0.4%); in patients with ovarian cancer, prevalent pathogenic variants were BRCA1 (8.7%), BRCA2 (5.8%), CHEK2 (1.4%), BRIP1 (0.9%), MSH2 (0.8%), and ATM (0.6%). Racial/ethnic differences in pathogenic variants included BRCA1 (ovarian cancer: whites, 7.2%; 95% CI, 5.9% to 8.8%; v Hispanics, 16.1%; 95% CI, 11.8% to 21.2%) and CHEK2 (breast cancer: whites, 2.3%; 95% CI, 1.8% to 2.8%; v blacks, 0.1%; 95% CI, 0% to 0.8%). When tested for all genes that current guidelines designate as associated with their cancer type, 7.8% of patients with breast cancer and 14.5% of patients with ovarian cancer had pathogenic variants.; CONCLUSION: Clinically-tested patients with breast and ovarian cancer in two large, diverse states had 8% to 15% prevalence of actionable pathogenic variants. Substantial testing gaps and disparities among patients with ovarian cancer are targets for improvement.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Targeted therapies are part of biomarker-driven strategies that exploit actionable molecular targets and have gained traction following survival benefits demonstrated in various systemic malignancies. In glioblastoma, where therapeutic options remain scarce and prognosis poor, targeted therapies offer an attractive treatment alternative and are actively examined in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the targeted therapies, including traditional small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies as well as immunotherapeutic approaches that are examined in clinical trials, and discuss the challenges of using them for the treatment of glioblastoma.; RECENT FINDINGS: Despite initial speculations, phase II/III trials of targeted therapies in adult patients with glioblastoma have largely failed. Recent trials have focused on improving patient stratification, drug-tissue penetration, and target and compensatory pathway inhibition to optimize treatment response. In contrast to traditional small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies, cancer immunotherapy may target specific molecular or immune checkpoint target(s) to trigger immune responses against glioblastoma. Early phase clinical trials of immunotherapy have shown encouraging results, and larger randomized trials are ongoing. Targeted therapies are being actively studied in clinical trials. Patients with glioblastoma should be prioritized for clinical trial participation.

AB BACKGROUND: As people increasingly receive personal health information through technology, there is increased importance for this information to be communicated with empathy and consideration for the patient's experience of consuming it. Although technology enables people to have more frequent and faster access to their health information, it could also cause unnecessary anxiety, distress, or confusion because of the sensitive and complex nature of the information and its potential to provide information that could be considered bad news.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to uncover insights for the design of health information technologies that potentially communicate bad news about health such as the result of a diagnosis, increased risk for a chronic or terminal disease, or overall declining health.; METHODS: On the basis of a review of established guidelines for clinicians on communicating bad news, we developed an interview guide and conducted interviews with patients, patients' family members, and clinicians on their experience of delivering and receiving the diagnosis of a serious disease. We then analyzed the data using a thematic analysis to identify overall themes from a perspective of identifying ways to translate these strategies to technology design.; RESULTS: We describe qualitative results combining an analysis of the clinical guidelines for sharing bad health news with patients and interviews on clinicians' specific strategies to communicate bad news and the emotional and informational support that patients and their family members seek. Specific strategies clinicians use included preparing for the patients' visit, anticipating patients' feelings, building a partnership of trust with patients, acknowledging patients' physical and emotional discomfort, setting up a scene where patients can process the information, helping patients build resilience and giving hope, matching the level of information to the patients' level of understanding, communicating face-to-face, if possible, and using nonverbal means. Patient and family member experiences included internal turmoil and emotional distress when receiving bad news and emotional and informational support that patients and family members seek.; CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study identify specific strategies for health information technologies to better promote empathic communication when they communicate concerning health news. We distill the findings from our study into design hypotheses for ways technologies may be able to help people better cope with the possibility of receiving bad health news, including tailoring the delivery of information to the patients' individual preferences, supporting interfaces for sharing patients' context, mitigating emotional stress from self-monitoring data, and identifying clear, actionable steps patients can take next. ©Eun Kyoung Choe, Marisa E Duarte, Hyewon Suh, Wanda Pratt, Julie A Kientz.

AB Precision medicine is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research document, which also includes preclinical human IBD mechanisms, environmental triggers, novel technologies, and pragmatic clinical research. The Challenges in IBD Research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the precision medicine section is focused on highlighting the main gap areas that must be addressed to get closer to treatments tailored to the biological and clinical characteristics of each patient, which is the aim of precision medicine. The main gaps were identified in: 1) understanding and predicting the natural history of IBD: disease susceptibility, activity, and behavior; 2) predicting disease course and treatment response; and 3) optimizing current and developing new molecular technologies. Suggested approaches to bridge these gaps include prospective longitudinal cohort studies to identify and validate precision biomarkers for prognostication of disease course, and prediction and monitoring of treatment response. To achieve this, harmonization across studies is key as well as development of standardized methods and infrastructure. The implementation of state-of-the-art molecular technologies, systems biology and machine learning approaches for multi-omics and clinical data integration and analysis will be also fundamental. Finally, randomized biomarker-stratified trials will be critical to evaluate the clinical utility of validated signatures and biomarkers in improving patient outcomes and cost-effective care. © 2019 Crohns & Colitis Foundation.

AB Novel technologies is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research document, which also includes preclinical human IBD mechanisms, environmental triggers, precision medicine and pragmatic clinical research. The Challenges in IBD research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the novel technologies section is focused on prioritizing unmet clinical needs in IBD that will benefit from novel technologies applied to: 1) non-invasive detection and monitoring of active inflammation and assessment of treatment response; 2) mucosal targeted drug delivery systems; and 3) prevention of post-operative septic complications and treatment of fistulizing complications. Proposed approaches include development of multiparametric imaging modalities and biosensors, to enable non invasive or minimally invasive detection of pro-inflammatory signals to monitor disease activity and treatment responses. Additionally, technologies for local drug delivery to control unremitting disease and increase treatment efficacy while decreasing systemic exposure are also proposed. Finally, research on biopolymers and other sealant technologies to promote post-surgical healing; and devices to control anastomotic leakage and prevent post-surgical complications and recurrences are also needed. © 2019 Crohns & Colitis Foundation.

The Challenges in IBD research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the environmental triggers section is focused on the main research gaps in elucidating causality of environmental factors in IBD. Research gaps were identified in: 1) epidemiology of exposures; 2) identification of signatures of biological response to exposures; and 3) mechanisms of how environmental exposures drive IBD. To address these gaps, the implementation of longitudinal prospective studies to determine disease evolution and identify sub-clinical changes in response to exposures is proposed. This can help define critical windows of vulnerability and risk prediction. In addition, systems biology analysis and in silico modeling were proposed as approaches to integrate the IBD exposome for the identification of biological signatures of response to exposures, and to develop prediction models of the effects of environmental factors in driving disease activity and response to therapy. This research could lead to identification of biomarkers of exposures and new modalities for therapeutic intervention. Finally, hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies to understand gene-environment interactions and to validate causality of priority factors should be performed to determine how environment influences clinical outcomes. © 2019 Crohns & Colitis Foundation.

AB Preclinical human IBD mechanisms is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research document, which also include environmental triggers, novel technologies, precision medicine and pragmatic clinical research. The Challenges in IBD research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the preclinical human IBD mechanisms manuscript is focused on highlighting the main research gaps in the pathophysiological understanding of human IBD. These research gap areas include: 1) triggers of immune responses; 2) intestinal epithelial homeostasis and wound repair; 3) age-specific pathophysiology; 4) disease complications; 5) heterogeneous response to treatments; and 6) determination of disease location. As an approach to address these research gaps, the prioritization of reverse translation studies is proposed in which clinical observations are the foundation for experimental IBD research in the lab, and for the identification of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The use of human samples in validating basic research findings and development of precision medicine solutions is also proposed. This prioritization aims to put emphasis on relevant biochemical pathways and humanized in vitro and in vivo models that extrapolate meaningfully to human IBD, to eventually yield first-in-class and effective therapies. © 2019 Crohns & Colitis Foundation.

AB Pragmatic clinical research is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research document, which also includes preclinical human IBD mechanisms, environmental triggers, novel technologies, and precision medicine. The Challenges in IBD research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the pragmatic clinical research section is focused on highlighting gaps that need to be addressed in order to optimize and standardize IBD care. Identified gaps include: 1) understanding the incidence and prevalence of IBD; 2) evaluating medication positioning to increase therapeutic effectiveness; 3) understanding the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM); 4) studying pain management; and 5) understanding healthcare economics and resources utilization. To address these gaps, there is a need to emphasize the use of emerging data sources and real-world evidence to better understand epidemiologic and therapeutic trends in IBD, expanding on existing data to better understand how and where we should improve care. Proposed approaches include epidemiological studies in ethnically and geographically diverse cohorts to estimate incidence and prevalence of IBD and impact of diversity on treatment patterns and outcomes. The implementation of new clinical trial design and methodologies will be essential to evaluate optimal medication positioning, appropriate use of TDM in adults and children, and multidisciplinary approaches to IBD pain management and its impact on healthcare resources. © 2019 Crohns & Colitis Foundation.

AB Blood-borne metastasis accounts formost cancer-related deaths and involves circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that are successful in establishing new tumors at distant sites. CTCs are found in the bloodstream of patients as single cells (single CTCs) or as multicellular aggregates (CTC clusters and CTC-white blood cell clusters), with the latter displaying a higher metastatic ability. Beyond enumeration, phenotypic and molecular analysis is extraordinarily important to dissect CTC biology and to identify actionable vulnerabilities. Here, we provide a detailed description of a workflow that includes CTC immunostaining and micromanipulation, ex vivo culture to assessproliferative and survival capabilities of individual cells, and in vivo metastasis-formation assays. Additionally, we provide a protocol to achieve the dissociation of CTC clusters into individual cells and the investigation of intra-cluster heterogeneity. With these approaches, for instance, we precisely quantify survival and proliferative potential of single CTCs and individual cells within CTC clusters, leading us to the observation that cells within clusters display better survival and proliferation in ex vivo cultures compared to single CTCs. Overall, our workflow offers a platform to dissect the characteristics of CTCs at the single cell level, aiming towards the identification of metastasis-relevant pathways and a better understanding of CTC biology.

AB CLINICAL QUESTION: What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.; CURRENT PRACTICE: Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels >10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.; RECOMMENDATION: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH >20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤30 years old).; HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.; THE EVIDENCE: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.; UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

AB Resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy remains therapeutic challenge in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this work, we demonstrate that targeting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a potential sensitizing strategy to overcome chemoresistance in NPC. We observe the aberrant activation of eIF4E and translational upregulation of eIF4E-regulated oncogenes in NPC cell after pro-longed exposure of cisplatin. Functional analysis demonstrates that eIF4E depletion effectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant NPC cells. Consistently, eIF4E knockdown significantly enhances cisplatin efficacy in cisplatin-sensitive cells. We identify eIF4E as a therapeutically actionable targets by showing that ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, phenocopies the effects of eIF4E knockdown in NPC. We further demonstrate that ribavirin acts on chemoresistant NPC cells through suppressing eIF4E activity and oncogenic protein translation. Using two independent NPC xenograft mouse models, we show that ribavirin not only is effective in inhibiting chemoresistant NPC growth but also significantly augments the inhibitory effects of cisplatin efficacy invivo without causing significant toxicity in mice. Taken together, our work shows an activation of eIF4E-mediated growth and survival mechanisms in response to chemotherapy and suggests that inhibition of eIF4E activity represents an attractive sensitizing strategy for NPC treatment. Our findings also suggest that ribavirin is a useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for NPC. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Having a baby in a new country can be challenging, especially if unable to communicate in a preferred language. The aim of this paper is to explore the provision of health information for Afghan women and men during pregnancy, childbirth and the first year after birth in Melbourne, Australia.; METHODS: Community engagement underpinned the study design. Qualitative study with bicultural researchers conducting semi-structured interviews. Interviews and focus groups were also conducted with health professionals.; RESULTS: Sixteen Afghan women and 14 Afghan men with a baby aged 4-12 months participated. Thirty four health professionals also participated. Verbal information provided by a health professional with an interpreter was the most common way in which information was exchanged, and was generally viewed favourably by Afghan women and men. Families had limited access to an interpreter during labour and some families reported difficulty accessing an interpreter fluent in their dialect. Availability of translated information was inconsistent and health professionals occasionally used pictures to support explanations. Women and men were unsure of the role of health professionals in providing information about issues other than pregnancy and infant wellbeing.; CONCLUSION: Both individual and health system issues hinder and enable the availability and use of information. Consistent, understandable and 'actionable' information is required to meet the needs of diverse families. Health professionals need to be supported with adequate alternatives to written information and access to appropriate interpreters. Inconsistent provision of information is likely to contribute to low health literacy and poor maternal and child health outcomes. Copyright © 2019 Australian College of Midwives.

AB Improving the systemic treatment of brain metastases (BM) in primary breast cancer (PBC) is impaired by the lack of genomic characterization of BM. To estimate the concordance of DNA copy-number-alterations (CNAs), mutations, and actionable genetic alterations (AGAs) between paired samples, we performed whole-genome array-comparative-genomic-hybridization, and targeted-next-generation-sequencing on 14 clinical PBC-BM pairs. We found more CNAs, more mutations, and higher tumor mutational burden, and more AGAs in BM than in PBC; 92% of the pairs harbored at least one AGA in the BM not observed in the paired PBC. This concerned various therapeutic classes, including tyrosine-kinase-receptor-inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/ mammalian Target of Rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/MTOR)-inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitors, or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitors. With regards to the PARP-inhibitors, the homologous recombination defect score was positive in 79% of BM, compared to 43% of PBC, discordant in 7 out of 14 pairs, and positive in the BM in 5 out of 14 cases. CDK-inhibitors were associated with the largest percentage of discordant AGA appearing in the BM. When considering the AGA with the highest clinical-evidence level, for each sample, 50% of the pairs harbored an AGA in the BM not detected or not retained from the analysis of the paired PBC. Thus, the profiling of BM provided a more reliable opportunity, than that of PBC, for diagnostic decision-making based on genomic analysis. Patients with BM deserve an investigation of several targeted therapies.

AB Reproducibility of disease signatures and clinical biomarkers in multi-omics disease analysis has been a key challenge due to a multitude of factors. The heterogeneity of the limited sample, various biological factors such as environmental confounders, and the inherent experimental and technical noises, compounded with the inadequacy of statistical tools, can lead to the misinterpretation of results, and subsequently very different biology. In this paper, we investigate the biomarker reproducibility issues, potentially caused by differences of statistical methods with varied distribution assumptions or marker selection criteria using Mass Spectrometry proteomic ovarian tumor data. We examine the relationship between effect sizes, p values, Cauchy p values, False Discovery Rate p values, and the rank fractions of identified proteins out of thousands in the limited heterogeneous sample. We compared the markers identified from statistical single features selection approaches with machine learning wrapper methods. The results reveal marked differences when selecting the protein markers from varied methods with potential selection biases and false discoveries, which may be due to the small effects, different distribution assumptions, and p value type criteria versus prediction accuracies. The alternative solutions and other related issues are discussed in supporting the reproducibility of findings for clinical actionable outcomes.

AB Personalized medicine, one of the main promises of the Human Genome Project (HGP) that began three decades ago, is now a new therapeutic paradigm. With its arrival the era of developing drugs to suit all patients, yet often having to withdraw a promising new one because a minority of patients was at risk, even though it had proved valuable for the majority was consigned to history as were trial-and-error strategies being the predominant means of tailoring therapy. But how did it originate and the earliest examples emerge? Is it true that the first personalized diagnostic test was the companion test for Herceptin? This account of a remarkable journey from genomic and translational research to therapeutic and diagnostic innovations, describes how sequencing the human growth hormone (hGH) locus provided proof of principle for HGP-inspired personalized medicine. Sequencing this locus and the resultant biomanufacture of HGH and the development of a test capable of detecting which patients would benefit from its administration helped silence the skeptics who questioned the validity of such an approach. The associated companion diagnostic was created four years before the invention of the HercepTest (registered as the first companion diagnostics ever developed). By cultivating genomic research with passion and pursuing its applications, we and many others contributed to the emergence of a new diagnostics industry, the discovery of better actionable gene-targets and to a revitalized pharmaceutical industry capable of developing safer and more effective therapies. In combination, these developments are beginning to fulfill the promise of the HGP, offering each patient the opportunity to adopt the right treatment at the correct dosage in an opportune manner.

AB Importance: Novel sensitive methods for detection and monitoring of residual disease can improve postoperative risk stratification with implications for patient selection for adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT), ACT duration, intensity of radiologic surveillance, and, ultimately, outcome for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).; Objective: To investigate the association of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with recurrence using longitudinal data from ultradeep sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA in patients with CRC before and after surgery, during and after ACT, and during surveillance.; Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, ctDNA was quantified in the preoperative and postoperative settings of stages I to III CRC by personalized multiplex, polymerase chain reaction-based, next-generation sequencing. The study enrolled 130 patients at the surgical departments of Aarhus University Hospital, Randers Hospital, and Herning Hospital in Denmark from May 1, 2014, to January 31, 2017. Plasma samples (n=829) were collected before surgery, postoperatively at day 30, and every third month for up to 3 years.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were ctDNA measurement, clinical recurrence, and recurrence-free survival.; Results: A total of 130 patients with stages I to III CRC (mean [SD] age, 67.9 [10.1] years; 74 [56.9%] male) were enrolled in the study; 5 patients discontinued participation, leaving 125 patients for analysis. Preoperatively, ctDNA was detectable in 84 of 94 patients (89.4%). After definitive treatment, longitudinal ctDNA analysis identified 14 of 16 relapses (87.5%). At postoperative day 30, ctDNA-positive patients were 7 times more likely to relapse than ctDNA-negative patients (hazard ratio [HR], 7.2; 95% CI, 2.7-19.0; P<.001). Similarly, shortly after ACT ctDNA-positive patients were 17 times (HR, 17.5; 95% CI, 5.4-56.5; P<.001) more likely to relapse. All 7 patients who were ctDNA positive after ACT experienced relapse. Monitoring during and after ACT indicated that 3 of the 10 ctDNA-positive patients (30.0%) were cleared by ACT. During surveillance after definitive therapy, ctDNA-positive patients were more than 40 times more likely to experience disease recurrence than ctDNA-negative patients (HR, 43.5; 95% CI, 9.8-193.5 P<.001). In all multivariate analyses, ctDNA status was independently associated with relapse after adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk factors. Serial ctDNA analyses revealed disease recurrence up to 16.5 months ahead of standard-of-care radiologic imaging (mean, 8.7 months; range, 0.8-16.5 months). Actionable mutations were identified in 81.8% of the ctDNA-positive relapse samples.; Conclusions and Relevance: Circulating tumor DNA analysis can potentially change the postoperative management of CRC by enabling risk stratification, ACT monitoring, and early relapse detection.

AB Purpose: Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels for solid tumors have been useful in clinical framework for accurate tumor diagnosis and identifying essential molecular aberrations. However, most cancer panels have been designed to address a wide spectrum of pan-cancer models, lacking integral prognostic markers that are highly specific to gliomas.; Materials and Methods: To address such challenges, we have developed a glioma-specific NGS panel, termed "GliomaSCAN," that is capable of capturing single nucleotide variations and insertion/deletion, copy number variation, and selected promoter mutations and structural variations that cover a subset of intron regions in 232 essential glioma-associated genes. We confirmed clinical concordance rate using pairwise comparison of the identified variants from whole exome sequencing (WES), immunohistochemical analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization.; Results: Our panel demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting potential genomic variants that were present in the standard materials. To ensure the accuracy of our targeted sequencing panel, we compared our targeted panel to WES. The comparison results demonstrated a high correlation. Furthermore, we evaluated clinical utility of our panel in 46 glioma patients to assess the detection capacity of potential actionable mutations. Thirty-two patients harbored at least one recurrent somatic mutation in clinically actionable gene.; Conclusion: We have established a glioma-specific cancer panel. GliomaSCAN highly excelled in capturing somatic variations in terms of both sensitivity and specificity and provided potential clinical implication in facilitating genome-based clinical trials. Our results could provide conceptual advance towards improving the response of genomically guided molecularly targeted therapy in glioma patients.

AB In the era of smaller and smaller biopsies submitted to pathology departments for diagnosis and the advent of personalized medicine, it has become imperative to efficiently and effectively use patient material to reach individualized, actionable diagnoses. The use of fine needle aspirates and core biopsies as acceptable methods for obtaining sufficient material for hematopoietic neoplasms under nonemergent conditions is debatable. There are, however, scenarios where only limited material is obtainable due to anatomic site, size of the lesion or condition of the patient. In these types of settings, thoughtful approaches and unconventional means are often necessary to reach a diagnosis. In this article, we describe three such scenarios and the unique tactics taken in each to obtain a personalized actionable diagnosis. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of this article is to outline overall goals, recommendations, and provide practical How-To strategies for developing and facilitating patient safety and system integration (PSSI) simulations for healthcare team members and organizations.; BACKGROUND: Simulation is increasingly being used as a quality improvement tool to better understand the tasks, environments, and processes that support the delivery of healthcare services. These PSSI simulations paired with system-focused debriefing can occur prior to implementing a new process or workflow to proactively identify system issues. They occur as part of a continuous cycle of quality improvement and have unique considerations for planning, implementation, and delivery of healthcare.; METHOD: The Delphi technique was used to develop the recommendations and How-To strategies to guide those interested in conducting a PSSI simulations. The Delphi technique is a structured communication technique and systematic process of gathering information from a group of identified experts through a series of questionnaires to gain consensus regarding judgments on complex processes, where precise information is not available in the literature. The Delphi technique permitted an iterative and multistaged approach to transform expert opinions into group consensus.; RESULTS: The goals, recommendations, and How-To strategies include a focus on project management, stakeholder engagement, sponsorship, scenario design, prebriefing and debriefing, and evaluation metrics. The intent is to proactively identify system issues and disseminate actionable findings.; CONCLUSIONS: This article highlights salient features to consider when using simulation as a strategy and tool for patient safety and quality improvement.

AB Objective: Patient education materials (PEMs) are commonly used for patient education. This study assessed readability, format quality, accuracy, understandability and actionability of printed asthma PEMs available in primary care in Singapore. Methods: Primary care in Singapore is provided by island-wide polyclinics and private general practices. We invited the three polyclinic healthcare groups and private general practices via the Primary Care Research Network to submit asthma-related PEMs. Readability was assessed using Simple Measure of Gobbledegook (SMOG) and Flesch-Kincaid (FK) score. Format quality was assessed using "Clear-print and large-print golden rules" from UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF). Understandability and actionability were evaluated using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool - Printed. Three pulmonologists assessed content accuracy. Results: Thirty leaflets were assessed. SMOG and FK estimated 93% (mean 9.3, range 5-14, SD 1.8) and 47% (mean 6.8, range 2.4-9.9, SD 2.0) exceeded the recommended sixth-grade reading level, respectively. About a third (37%) were fully concordant with UKAAF guidelines, with poor format quality contributed by small font size, poor text emphasis methods, and not using left-aligned text. Leaflets generally scored well in both understandability (mean 84%) and actionability (mean 72%). Thirteen leaflets were inaccurate, 92% of which contained at least one inaccuracy judged to have potentially harmful consequences to patients, including wrong emergency advice. Conclusion: While understandability and actionability are adequate, current asthma PEMs are limited by inappropriately high reading levels, poor format quality and inaccuracies. Healthcare professionals need to assess patients' reading abilities and ensure PEMs are accurate and suitable for their patients.

AB Patients who are at high or very high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events derive the greatest benefit when clinicians prescribe evidence-based preventive therapies. The writing process used in the creation of the 2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol employed a thorough evaluation of the highest quality evidence, and synthesis of this evidence into actionable recommendations for ASCVD risk reduction. Clinical trials supporting the addition of ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or both to evidence-based statins provide the basis for the updated recommendations for the preventive care of these patients. The publication in late 2018 of a randomized controlled trial supporting the net ASCVD risk reduction benefit of adding icosapent ethyl to statins in selected hypertriglyceridemic patients with clinical ASCVD and/or type 2 diabetes with multiple additional risk markers provides the rationale for incorporation of icosapent ethyl therapy into future ASCVD preventive care regimens.

AB To evaluate current online parent education resources for children returning to school after a cancer diagnosis. Online search was conducted using 3 search engines and terms recommended by affected families. Sites were evaluated by 3 reviewers for understandability and actionability (scored 0-100%) using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Readability was assessed using Flesch-Kincaid (grade K-12) and content comprehensiveness by a clinical expert review for 5 late effect domains (scored 0-100%). A total of 56 unique online resources were evaluated. Mean understandability and actionability scores were 54% (range 17-83) and 36% (range 0-83) respectively. The mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 10th grade (mode 12th). Comprehensiveness of domain coverage was 34% (mode 20%). Some high-quality materials for this topic are available, but generally low scores on the PEMAT scales and high reading level estimates on Flesch-Kincaid indicate parents may have difficulty understanding and using the information. The low scores for comprehensiveness of information indicate parents will likely need to access multiple sources for complete information. A table provides the names, website (URL), and scoring for the 24 top-rated sites and can be used to make recommendations to parents with improved confidence in quality.

AB BACKGROUND: Anaplasmosis presents with fever, headache, and laboratory abnormalities including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred diagnostic but is overutilized. We determined if routine laboratory tests could exclude anaplasmosis, improving PCR utilization.; METHODS: Anaplasma PCR results from a 3-year period, with associated complete blood count (CBC) and liver function test (LFT) results, were retrospectively reviewed. PCR rejection criteria, based on white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) count, were developed and prospectively applied in a mock-stewardship program. If rejection criteria were met, a committee mock-refused PCR unless the patient was clinically unstable or immunocompromised.; RESULTS: WBC and PLT counts were the most actionable routine tests for excluding anaplasmosis. Retrospective review demonstrated rejection criteria of WBC≥11,000/L or PLT≥300,000/L would have led to PCR refusal in 428/1685 true-negative cases (25%) and 3/66 true-positive cases (5%) involving clinically unstable or immunocompromised patients. In the prospective phase, 155/663 PCR requests (23%) met rejection criteria and were reviewed by committee, which endorsed refusal in 110/155 cases (71%) and approval in 45 (29%), based on clinical criteria. PCR was negative in all 45 committee-approved cases. Only 1/110 mock-refused requests yielded a positive PCR result; this patient was already receiving doxycycline at the time of testing.; CONCLUSIONS: A CBC-based stewardship algorithm would reduce unnecessary Anaplasma PCR testing, without missing active cases. Although the prospectively-evaluated screening approach involved medical record review, this was unnecessary to prevent errors and could be replaced by a rejection comment specifying clinical situations that might warrant overriding the algorithm. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB In a smart home linked to a smart grid (SG), demand-side management (DSM) has the potential to reduce electricity costs and carbon/chlorofluorocarbon emissions, which are associated with electricity used in today's modern society. To meet continuously increasing electrical energy demands requested from downstream sectors in an SG, energy management systems (EMS), developed with paradigms of artificial intelligence (AI) across Internet of things (IoT) and conducted in fields of interest, monitor, manage, and analyze industrial, commercial, and residential electrical appliances efficiently in response to demand response (DR) signals as DSM. Usually, a DSM service provided by utilities for consumers in an SG is based on cloud-centered data science analytics. However, such cloud-centered data science analytics service involved for DSM is mostly far away from on-site IoT end devices, such as DR switches/power meters/smart meters, which is usually unacceptable for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM. This implies that, for instance, IoT end devices deployed on-site for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM should be aware of immediately analytical, interpretable, and real-time actionable data insights processed on and identified by IoT end devices at IoT sources. Therefore, this work designs and implements a smart edge analytics-empowered power meter prototype considering advanced AI in DSM for smart homes. The prototype in this work works in a cloud analytics-assisted electrical EMS architecture, which is designed and implemented as edge analytics in the architecture described and developed toward a next-generation smart sensing infrastructure for smart homes. Two different types of AI deployed on-site on the prototype are conducted for DSM and compared in this work. The experimentation reported in this work shows the architecture described with the prototype in this work is feasible and workable.

AB To manage chronic disease patients effectively, clinicians must know (1) how to monitor each patient (i.e., when to schedule the next visit and which tests to take), and (2) how to control the disease (i.e., what levels of controllable risk factors will sufficiently slow progression). Our research addresses these questions simultaneously and provides the optimal solution to a novel linear quadratic Gaussian state space model. For the objective of minimizing the relative change in state over time (i.e., disease progression), which is necessary for managing irreversible chronic diseases while also considering the cost of tests and treatment, we show that the classical two-way separation of estimation and control holds. This makes a previously intractable problem solvable by decomposition into two separate, tractable problems while maintaining optimality. The resulting optimization is applied to the management of glaucoma. Based on data from two large randomized clinical trials, we validate our model and demonstrate how our decision support tool can provide actionable insights to the clinician caring for a patient with glaucoma. This methodology can be applied to a broad range of irreversible chronic diseases to devise patient-specific monitoring and treatment plans optimally.

AB Inactivating CDK12 alterations have been reported in ovarian and prostate cancers and may have therapeutic implications; however, the prevalence of these mutations across other cancer types is unknown. We searched the cBioPortal and GENIE Project (public release v4.1) databases for cancer types with > 200 sequenced cases, that included patients with metastatic disease, and in which the occurrence of at least monoallelic CDK12 alterations was > 1%. The prevalence of at least monoallelic CDK12 mutations was highest in bladder cancer (3.7%); followed by prostate (3.4%), esophago-gastric (2.1%) and uterine cancers (2.1%). Biallelic CDK12 inactivation was highest in prostate cancer (1.8%), followed by ovarian (1.0%) and bladder cancers (0.5%). These results are the first (to our knowledge) to estimate the prevalence of monoallelic and biallelic CDK12 mutations across multiple cancer types encompassing over 15,000 cases.

AB The development of genomic technologies has seemed almost magical. Excitement about it, both in medicine and among the public, stems from the belief that genomic techniques will illuminate the causes of health and disease, will lead to effective interventions for both rare and common genetic conditions, and will inform reproductive decision-making. Novel diagnostic tools, however, are often deployed before targeted therapies are developed, tested, or available and before their psychosocial implications are explored. Newer technologies such as prenatal whole exome screening are seen as offering "decisional autonomy" to expectant parents, although such technologies identify information about genetic sequencing that may not have clear meaning. The "therapeutic gap" between the ability to conduct genetic sequencing and the ability to fully understand what the test results mean, much less what treatments to offer, leaves families with complex and unclear information they cannot act upon with confidence during pregnancy. In this essay, we will consider the psychosocial and ethical implications of such assumptions-and of the uncertain information produced by these technologies-for individuals and families and for societal aspects such as medical service usage and demographic inequities. © 2019 The Hastings Center.

AB At the dawn of the new century, Robert Plomin was gloomy. As he recounts in Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are, attempts to find the DNA responsible for the heritability of behavior failed. Month after month, journals would report new findings of specific genes for behavioral phenotypes, but they never replicated. One amazing genomic methodology after another was developed in biological genetics and applied to medicine, where it succeeded, and then to human behavior, where it failed. This was the moment of Plomin's despair. He had, with great intellectual courage, staked his reputation on the existence of actionable scientific knowledge of the DNA-based genesis of twin-based heritability. But Blueprint is hardly the product of a gloomy author. Quite the opposite: it is a declaration of victory of nature over nurture, a celebration of the vindication of Plomin as a scientist and of behavior genetics as a field of study. What happened between 2000 and 2019 to brighten Plomin's outlook so radically? Were the genes for schizophrenia and intelligence finally discovered? Are we at last on our way to understanding why, at a biological level, all differences in human behavior are substantially heritable? Alas, no. What happened is that Robert Plomin gave up on the search for individual genes that explain heritability and decided to be satisfied with much less. © 2019 The Hastings Center.

AB Precision oncology hinges on linking tumour genotype with molecularly targeted drugs1; however, targeting the frequently dysregulated metabolic landscape of cancer has proven to be a major challenge2. Here we show that tissue context is the major determinant of dependence on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolic pathway in cancer. By analysing more than 7,000 tumours and 2,600 matched normal samples of 19 tissue types, coupled with mathematical modelling and extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses, we identify a simple and actionable set of 'rules'. If the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo NAD synthesis, NAPRT, is highly expressed in a normal tissue type, cancers that arise from that tissue will have a high frequency of NAPRT amplification and be completely and irreversibly dependent on NAPRT for survival. By contrast, tumours that arise from normal tissues that do not express NAPRT highly are entirely dependent on the NAD salvage pathway for survival. We identify the previously unknown enhancer that underlies this dependence. Amplification of NAPRT is shown to generate a pharmacologically actionable tumour cell dependence for survival. Dependence on another rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD synthesis pathway, NAMPT, as a result of enhancer remodelling is subject to resistance by NMRK1-dependent synthesis of NAD. These results identify a central role for tissue context in determining the choice of NAD biosynthetic pathway, explain the failure of NAMPT inhibitors, and pave the way for more effective treatments.

AB OBJECTIVE: Understanding how to successfully implement care coordination programs across diverse settings is critical for disseminating best practices. We describe how we operationalized the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to guide the assessment of local context prior to implementation of the rural Transitions Nurse Program (TNP) at five facilities across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).; METHODS: We operationalized PRISM to create qualitative data collection techniques (interview guides, semi-structured observations, and a group brainwriting premortem) to assess local context, the current state of care coordination, and perceptions of TNP prior to implementation at five facilities. We analyzed data using deductive-inductive framework analysis to identify themes related to PRISM. We adapted implementation strategies at each site using these findings.; RESULTS: We identified actionable themes within PRISM domains to address during implementation. The most commonly occurring PRISM domains were "organizational characteristics" and "implementation and sustainability infrastructure." Themes included a disconnect between primary care and hospital inpatient teams, concerns about work duplication, and concerns that one nurse could not meet the demand for the program. These themes informed TNP implementation.; CONCLUSIONS: The use of PRISM for pre-implementation site assessments yielded important findings that guided adaptations to our implementation approach. Further, barriers and facilitators to TNP implementation may be common to other care coordination interventions. Generating a common language of barriers and facilitators in care coordination initiatives will enhance generalizability and establish best practices.; IMPACT STATEMENTS: TNP is a national intensive care coordination program targeting rural Veterans. We operationalized PRISM to guide implementation efforts. We effectively elucidated facilitators, barriers, and unique contextual factors at diverse VHA facilities. The use of PRISM enhances the generalizability of findings across care settings and may optimize implementation of care coordination interventions in the VHA.

AB This department column highlights translation of research into health care quality practice. Achieving the highest quality of health care requires attention to developing and sustaining process efficiencies, and a thorough understanding of data and reporting. Mitigating or eliminating harm from pressure injuries may be more quickly achieved when accurate and consistent data are available for creating actionable interventions. The three aims of this project were to (1) confirm internally reported hospital acquired pressure injury data, (2) identify opportunities for improving the accuracy of internal reports, and (3) design and implement innovative quality informatics solutions for pressure injury reporting.

AB The majority of pharmacogenomic (PGx) studies have been conducted on European ancestry populations, thereby excluding minority populations and impeding the discovery and translation of African American-specific genetic variation into precision medicine. Without accounting for variants found in African Americans, clinical recommendations based solely on genetic biomarkers found in European populations could result in misclassification of drug response in African American patients. To address these challenges, we formed the Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC), African American Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetic Consortium (ACCOuNT), to discover novel genetic variants in African Americans related to clinically actionable cardiovascular phenotypes and to incorporate African American-specific sequence variations into clinical recommendations at the point of care. The TCC consists of two research projects focused on discovery and translation of genetic findings and four cores that support the projects. In addition, the largest repository of PGx information on African Americans is being established as well as lasting infrastructure that can be utilized to spur continued research in this understudied population. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiome may dramatically affect the outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Providing 16S ribosomal RNA based microbiome characterization in a clinically actionable time frame is currently problematic. Thus, determination of microbial metabolites as surrogates for microbiome composition could offer practical biomarkers.; Methods: Longitudinal fecal specimens (n = 451) were collected from 44 patients before HSCT through 100 days after transplantation, as well as 1-time samples from healthy volunteers (n = 18) as controls. Microbiota composition was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA V4 sequencing. Fecal indole and butyrate levels were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.; Results: Among HSCT recipients, both fecal indole and butyrate levels correlated with the Shannon diversity index at baseline (P = .02 and P = .002, respectively) and directly after transplantation (P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). Samples with high butyrate levels were enriched for Clostridiales, whereas samples containing high indole were also enriched for Bacteroidales. A lower Shannon diversity index at the time of engraftment was associated with increased incidence of acute intestinal graft-vs-host disease (iGVHD) (P = .02) and transplant-related deaths (P = .03). Although fecal metabolites were not associated with acute iGVHD or overall survival, patients contracting bloodstream infections within 30 days after transplantation had significantly lower levels of fecal butyrate (P = .03).; Conclusions: Longitudinal analysis of fecal microbiome and metabolites after HSCT identified butyrate and indole as potential surrogate markers for microbial diversity and specific taxa. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether fecal metabolites can be used as biomarkers of acute iGVHD or bacteremia after HSCT.

AB BACKGROUND: Excessive electrocardiographic alarms contribute to "alarm fatigue," which can lead to patient harm. In a prior study, one-third of audible electrocardiographic alarms were for accelerated ventricular rhythm (AVR), and most of these alarms were false. It is uncertain whether true AVR alarms are clinically relevant.; OBJECTIVES: To determine from bedside electrocardiographic monitoring data (1) how often true AVR alarms are acknowledged by clinicians, (2) whether such alarms are actionable, and (3) whether such alarms are associated with adverse outcomes ("code blue," death).; METHODS: Secondary analysis using data from a study conducted in an academic medical center involving 5 adult intensive care units with 77 beds. Electronic health records of 23 patients with 223 true alarms for AVR were examined.; RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 62.9 years, and 61% were white and male. All 223 of the true alarms were configured at the warning level (ie, 2 continuous beeps), and 215 (96.4%) lasted less than 30 seconds. Only 1 alarm was acknowledged in the electronic health record. None of the alarms were clinically actionable or led to a code blue or death.; CONCLUSIONS: True AVR alarms may contribute to alarm fatigue. Hospitals should reevaluate the need for close monitoring of AVR and consider configuring this alarm to an inaudible message setting to reduce the risk of patient harm due to alarm fatigue. Prospective studies involving larger patient samples and varied monitors are warranted. © 2019 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

AB AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) functions as a tumor suppressor and several therapeutic targets in ARID1A-mutated cancers are under development. Here, we investigated the prognostic value of ARID1A for gastric cancer and its association with expression of PD-L1 and p53. ARID1A expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and negative expression of ARID1A was detected in 39 (19.5%) of 200 cases in a test cohort and in 40 (18.2%) of 220 cases in a validation cohort. Negative expression of ARID1A was associated with worse overall survival in undifferentiated cases, particularly early-stage cases. Negative expression of ARID1A was detected in 11 (50%) of 22 PD-L1-positive cases and in 68 (17.1%) of 398 PD-L1-negative cases in a combined cohort. Negative expression of ARID1A was detected in 45 (22%) of 205 p53-positive cases and in 34 (15.8%) of 215 p53-negative cases in a combined cohort. In addition, expression of EZH2, a potential synthetic lethal target in ARID1A-mutated tumors, was detected in 79 ARID1A-negative cases. An ARID1A-knockdown gastric cancer cell line was subjected to microarray analysis, but no actionable targets or pathways were identified. The present results indicate that ARID1A may serve as an early-stage prognostic biomarker for undifferentiated gastric cancer.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) at an older age are less likely to undergo genetic cancer risk assessment and genetic testing since the guidelines and referrals are biased toward earlier age at diagnosis. Thus, we determined the prevalence and type of pathogenic cancer predisposition variants among women with a history of BC diagnosed at the ageof 65 years or older vs younger than 65years.; DESIGN: Prospective registration cohort.; SETTING: The Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network, including 40 community-based clinics in the United States and 5 in Latin America.; PARTICIPANTS: Women with BC and genetic testing results.; MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical variables, and genetic profiles were compared between women aged 65 years and older andthose younger than 65years at BC diagnosis.; RESULTS: Among 588 women diagnosed with BC and aged 65years and older and 9412 diagnosed at younger than 65years, BC-associated pathogenic variants (PVs) were detected in 5.6% of those aged 65 years and older (n=33) and 14.2% of those younger than 65years (n=1340) (P<.01). PVs in high-risk genes (eg, BRCA1 and BRCA2) represented 81.1% of carriers among women aged 65years and older (n=27) and 93.1% of those younger than 65years (n=1248) (P=.01). BRCA2 PVs represented 42.4% of high-risk gene findings for those aged 65years and older, whereas BRCA1 PVs were most common among carriers younger than 65years (49.7%). PVs (n=7) in moderate-risk genes represented 21.2% for carriers aged 65 years and older and 7.3% of those younger than 65 years (n=98; P<.01). CHEK2 PVs were the most common moderate-risk gene finding in both groups.; CONCLUSION: Clinically actionable BC susceptibility PVs, particularly in BRCA2 and CHEK2, were relatively prevalent among older women undergoing genetic testing. The significant burden of PVs for older women with BC provides a critical reminder to recognize the full spectrum of eligibility and provide genetic testing for older women, rather than exclusion based on chronological age alone.

AB OBJECTIVES: Human-centered design (HCD) is a qualitative methodology that empathizes with end-users and assists in formulating preferable and practical interventions. We explored the utility of HCD in improving pediatric asthma healthcare outcomes among patient and caregiver populations within an urban academic center.; STUDY DESIGN: HCD employs a multiphase process that aims to identify the needs of end users and reframe solutions around each stakeholder's preference patterns.; METHODS: Ethnographic-style observations were initiated among pediatric asthma healthcare providers, community environmental activists, local government public health officials, households with a young child (<12 years of age) with asthma, and adolescent asthmatics. Common themes from the observations served as the basis for understanding users' experiences and determining actionable areas of improvement within outpatient asthma care. Multistakeholder brainstorming sessions led to the emergence of three prototypes that underwent low-fidelity field testing.; RESULTS: The first prototype elucidated caregivers' preferred outpatient asthma support systems using a newly created visual decision-making aid. The second constructed prototype was a child-oriented asthma activity sheet that allowed children to better communicate their understanding and impact of asthma care. The final prototype attempted to improve interactions between providers, caregivers, and children/adolescents using visual prompts to enhance empathetic and clinically-relevant dialogue.; CONCLUSION: Engaging a diverse population of relevant stakeholders in disease processes that use design thinking yield relevant solutions with enhanced community buy-in. The prototypes are continuing to undergo iterative field testing in local community and academic asthma care sites. Copyright © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blacks are at greater risk for lower sleep quality and higher risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) than other racial groups. In this study, we summarize the development of a tailored website including visuals, key messages, and video narratives, to promote awareness about sleep apnea among community-dwelling blacks. We utilized mixed methods, including in-depth interviews, usability-testing procedures, and brief surveys (n=9, 55% female, 100% black, average age 38.5years). Themes from the qualitative analysis illuminated varied knowledge regarding OSA symptoms and prevalent self-reported experience with sleep disturbance and OSA symptoms (e.g., snoring). On a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very high), participants provided favorable ratings of website usefulness (mean=4.9), user friendliness (mean=4.9) and attractiveness (mean=4.3). Our findings suggest although tailored health communication has potential for serving as a tool for advancing health equity, usability-testing of health materials is critical to ensure that culturally and linguistically tailored messages are acceptable and actionable in the intended population.

AB INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported Outcomes for Personalized Treatment and Care (PROMPT-Care) is the first eHealth system in Australia that is fully electronically integrated into hospital oncology information systems, enabling real-time, routine collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to support and enable cancer patients to achieve and maintain improved health, well-being, and cancer outcomes. Five previously published papers detail the impetus for developing this eHealth system, its development, and testing of its acceptability and feasibility, the development of algorithms to standardize the cancer care pathways which underpin patient care, and the protocol for evaluating the efficacy of PROMPT-Care.; METHODS: This manuscript provides "how-to" guidance to inform future system development, focusing on selecting relevant PROs and measuring them in cancer patients, score interpretation, and determining recommended care in response to scores which are above the predetermined threshold.; DISCUSSION: Electronic PRO systems are increasingly used in cancer clinical care settings, with the potential to support timely patient-centered care when implemented appropriately.; KEY POINTS: PRO selection should consider patient response burden, and prioritizing PROs that are amenable to clinical intervention. Having clear, evidence-based, care pathways, and actionable recommendations in response to above-threshold PRO scores facilitate PRO integration into the clinical workflow. Centers should determine thresholds for clinical action for each PRO which provide an acceptable balance between false positives and false negatives; and develop care pathway recommendations which consider the availability of local services and resources, are feasible in the clinical setting, clear, concise, manageable, based on evidence-based guidelines, and adaptable to local environments.

AB OBJECTIVES: Cutpoints are specific numeric values used to create discrete categories for patient-reported outcome (PRO) items or scales. Cutpoints are widely used in both clinical research and practice. This article offers a definition for cutpoints, describes strategies for determining actionable cutpoints, and discusses considerations related to interpreting cutpoints in clinical applications.; METHODS: We clarify the definition of cutpoints for PRO measures and summarize the major statistical approaches for identifying cutpoints, including multivariate analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristic and regression modeling.; DISCUSSION: We review issues related to cutpoint determination and interpretation that should be considered when integrating PROs into clinical research and practice, including the selection of anchors, variability of cutpoints, and clinical burden that may be generated when a cutpoint is used as a threshold for further clinical action.; KEY POINTS: Cutpoints are widely used to categorize PRO responses in both clinical research and practice. Cutpoints can be derived for PRO measures regardless of the response scale used; however, the mild, moderate, and severe categories generated from numeric cutpoints are distinct from the mild, moderate, and severe categories found in some PRO measures that use verbal descriptors as response options. Bootstrap analysis is recommended to quantify the variability of cutpoints. The application of cutpoints is limited by how well the anchors are chosen and how cutpoints developed using group-level data are applied at the individual level.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and cancer relapse accounts for the majority of cancer mortality. The mechanism is still unknown, especially in hereditary lung cancer without known actionable mutations. To identify genetic alternations involved in hereditary lung cancer and relapse is urgently needed. We collected genetic materials from a unique hereditary lung cancer patient's blood, first cancer tissue (T1), adjacent normal tissue (N1), relapse cancer tissue (T2), and adjacent normal tissue (N2) for whole genome sequencing. We identified specific mutations in T1 and T2, and attributed them to tumorigenesis and recurrence. These tumor specific variants were enriched in antigen presentation pathway. In addition, a lung adenocarcinoma cohort from the TCGA dataset was used to confirm our findings. Patients with high mutation burdens in tumor specific genes had decreased relapse-free survival (P=0.017, n=186). Our study may provide important insight for designing immunotherapeutic treatment for hereditary lung cancer. © 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Medulloblastoma (MB) is a pediatric malignant brain tumor composed of four different subgroups (WNT, SHH, Group 3, Group 4), each of which are a unique biological entity with distinct clinico-pathological, molecular, and prognostic characteristics. Although risk stratification of patients with MB based on molecular features may offer personalized therapies, conventional subgroup identification methods take too long and are unable to deliver subgroup information intraoperatively. This limitation prevents subgroup-specific adjustment of the extent or the aggressiveness of the tumor resection by the neurosurgeon. In this study, we investigated the potential of rapid tumor characterization with Picosecond infrared laser desorption mass spectrometry (PIRL-MS) for MB subgroup classification based on small molecule signatures. One hundred and thirteen ex vivo MB tumors from a local tissue bank were subjected to 10- to 15-second PIRL-MS data collection and principal component analysis with linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA). The MB subgroup model was established from 72 independent tumors; the remaining 41 de-identified unknown tumors were subjected to multiple, 10-second PIRL-MS samplings and real-time PCA-LDA analysis using the above model. The resultant 124 PIRL-MS spectra from each sampling event, after the application of a 95% PCA-LDA prediction probability threshold, yielded a 98.9% correct classification rate. Post-ablation histopathologic analysis suggested that intratumoral heterogeneity or sample damage prior to PIRL-MS sampling at the site of laser ablation was able to explain failed classifications. Therefore, upon translation, 10-seconds of PIRL-MS sampling is sufficient to allow personalized, subgroup-specific treatment of MB during surgery. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that laser-extracted lipids allow immediate grading of medulloblastoma tumors into prognostically important subgroups in 10 seconds, providing medulloblastoma pathology in an actionable manner during surgery. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Google Trends (GT) is a free, open-source tool that permits customizable analysis of search term volumes entered into the Google search engine. Google Trends data may offer useful and actionable insight to plastic surgeons pertaining to worldwide, national, and regional evolution of patient interest for breast procedures and other common surgeries.; METHODS: Search terms were generated using the "related queries" feature of GT. Google Trends data were collected for breast lift, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, and male breast reduction from January 2004 to September 2017. Case volumes for respective procedures were obtained from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) annual statistics reports for the calendar year 2006 to 2016. Trend analysis was performed using univariate linear regression analysis of ASPS statistics and GT search data.; RESULTS: Total search volume varied geographically and temporally during the study period. Statistically significant positive correlations between GT and ASPS data were as follows: breast lift: "mastopexy" (R = 0.445, P = 0.025); male breast reduction: "gynecomastia surgery" (R = 0.45, P = 0.024); and breast reconstruction: "tissue expander" (R = 0.806, P ≤ 0.001) and "TRAM flap reconstruction" (R = 0.764, P = 0.002). For several search terms, no significant correlation was detected, highlighting the importance for careful selection of terms.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to summarize recent advances in public health applications of comparative methods for HIV-1 sequence analysis in real time, including genetic clustering methods.; RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past 2 years, several groups have reported the deployment of established genetic clustering methods to guide public health decisions for HIV prevention in 'near real time'. However, it remains unresolved how well the readouts of comparative methods like clusters translate to events that are actionable for public health. A small number of recent studies have begun to elucidate the linkage between clusters and HIV-1 incidence, whereas others continue to refine and develop new comparative methods for such applications.; SUMMARY: Although the use of established methods to cluster HIV-1 sequence databases has become a widespread activity, there remains a critical gap between clusters and public health value.

AB Improvements in data resources and computational power provide important opportunities to ensure the continued relevance and growth of observational epidemiology. To achieve that promise, rigorous statistical analyses are important but not sufficient. We must prioritize articulating relevant research questions and developing strong study designs. Relevance depends on designing observational research so it delivers actionable clinical or population health evidence. Expanding data sources, including administrative records and data from emerging technologies such as sensors, can potentially be leveraged to improve study design, statistical power, measurement, and availability of evidence on diverse populations. With these advantages, particularly evidence on the heterogeneity of treatment effects, observational research can better guide design of randomized trials. Evidence on the heterogeneity of treatment effects is also essential to extend the evidence from randomized trials beyond the narrow range of settings and populations for which trials have been conducted. Machine learning tools will likely grow in importance in observational epidemiology in coming years, although we need careful attention to the appropriate uses of prediction models. Despite the potential of these innovations, they will only be useful if embedded in theoretical frameworks motivated by applied clinical and population health questions. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: Antitumor activity of molecular-targeted agents is guided by the presence of documented genomic alteration in specific histological subtypes. We aim to explore the feasibility, efficacy and therapeutic impact of molecular profiling in routine setting.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentric prospective study enrolled adult or pediatric patients with solid or hematological advanced cancer previously treated in advanced/metastatic setting and noneligible to curative treatment. Each molecular profile was established on tumor, relapse or biopsies, and reviewed by a molecular tumor board (MTB) to identify molecular-based recommended therapies (MBRT). The main outcome was to assess the incidence rate of genomic mutations in routine setting, across specific histological types. Secondary objectives included a description of patients with actionable alterations and for whom MBRT was initiated, and overall response rate.; RESULTS: Four centers included 2579 patients from February 2013 to February 2017, and the MTB reviewed the molecular profiles achieved for 1980 (76.8%) patients. The most frequently altered genes were CDKN2A (N=181, 7%), KRAS (N=177, 7%), PIK3CA (N=185, 7%), and CCND1 (N=104, 4%). An MBRT was recommended for 699/2579 patients (27%), and only 163/2579 patients (6%) received at least one MBRT. Out of the 182 lines of MBRT initiated, 23 (13%) partial responses were observed. However, only 0.9% of the whole cohort experienced an objective response.; CONCLUSION: An MBRT was provided for 27% of patients in our study, but only 6% of patients actually received matched therapy with an overall response rate of 0.9%. Molecular screening should not be used at present to guide decision-making in routine clinical practice outside of clinical trials.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774409. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a genetically heterogeneous disease for which a dominant actionable molecular driver has not been identified. Patients with the stem cell-like EpCAM+AFP+ HCC subtype have poor prognosis. Here, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes with a synthetic lethal interaction with EpCAM as a potential therapeutic target for the EpCAM+AFP+ HCC subtype. We identified 26 candidate genes linked to EpCAM/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and HCC cell growth. We further characterized the top candidate PMPCB, which plays a role in mitochondrial protein processing, as a bona fide target for EpCAM+ HCC. PMPCB blockage suppressed EpCAM expression and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via mitochondria-related reactive oxygen species production and FOXO activities, resulting in apoptosis and tumor suppression. These results indicate that a synthetic lethality screen is a viable strategy to identify actionable drivers of HCC and identify PMPCB as a therapeutically vulnerable gene in EpCAM+ HCC subpopulations. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies PMPCB as critical to mitochondrial homeostasis and a synthetic lethal candidate that selectively kills highly resistant EpCAM+ HCC tumors by inactivating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

In this report, we show that enrichment of the cancer stem cell (CSC) subsets and dysregulation of Notch signaling underlie the challenges to therapy and describe the development of bispecific antibodies targeting both HER and Notch signaling.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We utilized cell-based models to study Notch signaling in drug-induced CSC expansion. Both cancer cell line models and patient-derived xenograft tumors were used to evaluate the antitumor effects of bispecific antibodies. Cell assays, flow cytometry, qPCR, and in vivo serial transplantation assays were employed to investigate the mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamic readouts.; RESULTS: We found that EGFR/Notch targeting bispecific antibodies exhibited a notable antistem cell effect in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Bispecific antibodies delayed the occurrence of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer cell line-based models and showed efficacy in patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, the EGFR/Notch bispecific antibody PTG12 in combination with GDC-0941 exerted a stronger antitumor effect than the combined therapy of PI3K inhibitor with EGFR inhibitors or tarextumab in a broad spectrum of epithelial tumors. Mechanistically, bispecific antibody treatment inhibits the stem cell-like subpopulation, reduces tumor-initiating cell frequency, and downregulates the mesenchymal gene expression.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the coblockade of EGFR and Notch signaling has the potential to increase the response to PI3K inhibition, and PTG12 may gain clinical efficacy when combined with PI3K blockage in cancer treatment. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: With the growing understanding of the molecular and genetic profiles of cancers, targeted treatments are increasingly utilized in personalized cancer care. The objective of this study was to determine how these advances have translated into practice by examining how often molecular profiling of gynecological tumors led to treatment changes.; METHODS: We identified women with gynecological cancers at our institution who had molecular tumor testing performed from November 2014 to June 2017. Clinicopathologic data were extracted from medical records. We determined (a) if molecular profiling identified actionable targets for which therapy is available, and (b) whether the patient's treatment course changed as a result of molecular profiling. Chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Fisher's exact tests were used with a P<0.05 considered statistically significant.; RESULTS: We identified 152 patients with gynecologic cancers who underwent molecular profiling. Of the 152 patients, 116 (76.3%) had actionable mutations identified, with 41 (35.3%) patients having a treatment change. Stratified by cancer type, molecular profiling most frequently identified an actionable target in patients with endometrial cancer (73.6%). Changes in treatment occurred most frequently in patients with endometrial cancer, 22 (56.4%), and ovarian cancers, 16 (39%), as compared to patients with cervical and vulvar cancer (P=0.02). Of those patients who received a change in treatment, 39 patients (95.1%) received an FDA-approved therapeutic agent, while two patients (4.8%) were enrolled in a clinical trial.; CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling in gynecologic cancers often identified at least one actionable mutation; however, only in a minority of these cases was the course of treatment changed. Further studies are needed to elucidate optimal timing for testing to best utilize actionable information. © 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Importance: Tumor mutational burden (TMB), as measured by whole-exome sequencing (WES) or a cancer gene panel (CGP), is associated with immunotherapy responses. However, whether TMB estimated by circulating tumor DNA in blood (bTMB) is associated with clinical outcomes of immunotherapy remains to be explored.; Objectives: To explore the optimal gene panel size and algorithm to design a CGP for TMB estimation, evaluate the panel reliability, and further validate the feasibility of bTMB as a clinical actionable biomarker for immunotherapy.; Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, a CGP named NCC-GP150 was designed and virtually validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The correlation between bTMB estimated by NCC-GP150 and tissue TMB (tTMB) measured by WES was evaluated in matched blood and tissue samples from 48 patients with advanced NSCLC. An independent cohort of 50 patients with advanced NSCLC was used to identify the utility of bTMB estimated by NCC-GP150 in distinguishing patients who would benefit from anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapy. The study was performed from July 19, 2016, to April 20, 2018.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Assessment of the Spearman correlation coefficient between bTMB estimated by NCC-GP150 and tTMB calculated by WES. Evaluation of the association of bTMB level with progression-free survival and response to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapy.; Results: This study used 2 independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC (cohort 1: 48 patients; mean [SD] age, 60 [13] years; 15 [31.2%] female; cohort 2: 50 patients; mean [SD] age, 58 [8] years; 15 [30.0%] female). A CGP, including 150 genes, demonstrated stable correlations with WES for TMB estimation (median r2=0.91; interquartile range, 0.89-0.92), especially when synonymous mutations were included (median r2=0.92; interquartile range, 0.91-0.93), whereas TMB estimated by the NCC-GP150 panel found higher correlations with TMB estimated by WES than most of the randomly sampled 150-gene panels. Blood TMB estimated by NCC-GP150 correlated well with the matched tTMB calculated by WES (Spearman correlation=0.62). In the anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatment cohort, a bTMB of 6 or higher was associated with superior progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.84; log-rank P=.01) and objective response rates (bTMB ≥6: 39.3%; 95% CI, 23.9%-56.5%; bTMB <6: 9.1%; 95% CI, 1.6%-25.9%; P=.02).; Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that established NCC-GP150 with an optimized gene panel size and algorithm is feasible for bTMB estimation, which may serve as a potential biomarker of clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents.

AB Objective: To explore an interprofessional group of health care providers' perspectives on the facilitators and barriers to implementation of an inpatient acupuncture service for pain and symptom management. Design: Qualitative. Setting: An urban, academic, tertiary care health system. Subjects: Key interprofessional health care providers, including physicians, nurses, and administrators. Methods/interventions: We used interviews and focus group with questions guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework to explore three domains of implementation-evidence, context, and facilitation. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Thirty health professionals participated in 11 interviews and 1 focus group. We identified 12 codes or topics, grouped into 3 categories: (1) facilitators to implementation, (2) barriers to implementation, and (3) strategies to promote successful implementation. Health professionals' awareness of acupuncture was high, and the positive support was based on beliefs that acupuncture fills a biomedical gap in treatment and adds institutional value by enhancing the reputation of the health system. Many thought that to provide comprehensive care, acupuncture should be available to inpatients, but opinions varied on the appropriateness and timing of acupuncture in patients' disease or care trajectory. Concerns about inconsistencies in insurance coverage and resulting expenses patients may incur were noted. Strategies to overcome implementation challenges included ensuring buy-in, setting appropriate expectations of the benefits of acupuncture, and educating patients and providers. Conclusions: Our study finds clear support for acupuncture. These strong endorsements were the foundation of facilitating factors that can guide implementation of acupuncture in the inpatient setting. Although we also identified potential barriers to implementation that must be addressed, we also report a number of actionable steps to operationalize evidence-based acupuncture to patients who are inpatients.

AB AIM: Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow for evaluation of genetic alterations in various cancer-related genes in daily clinical practice. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is often used for NGS-based clinical sequencing assays; however, the success rate of NGS assays using archival FFPE tumor tissue is reported to be lower than that using fresh tumor tissue. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided liver tumor biopsy for NGS-based multiplex gene assays.; METHODS: We compared the success rate of NGS assays between archival FFPE tumor tissues and US-guided liver tumor biopsy tissues, and summarized the treatment progress of the patients.; RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing assays using US-guided liver biopsy samples were successful in all patients (22/22), whereas the success rate with archival FFPE tumor tissue was 84.8% (151/178, P<0.05). At least one potentially actionable genetic alteration was identified from the US-guided liver biopsy samples in 20 of 22 patients. Among the 18 patients with actionable genetic alterations targetable with drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, eight initiated mutation-driven targeted therapies. Of these eight patients, four achieved partial response or stable disease for at least 4months, and three were not assessable for response due to short exposure. There were no biopsy-related complications requiring additional treatment.; CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that US-guided liver tumor biopsy is a useful and safe method for obtaining high-quality samples for NGS-based clinical sequencing. In cases with metastatic liver tumors, US-guided biopsy should be considered to provide accurate and optimal sequencing results for patients. © 2019 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

AB INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer patients with tumors harboring actionable alterations can achieve very durable responses to first-line targeted therapy. However, identifying targetable alterations using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a complex and time-intensive process. As actionable genetic alterations are enriched in lung cancers arising in patients with limited smoking history, we designed a workflow to expedite NGS testing for this group.; METHODS: We developed a protocol to allow for next-day extraction of nucleic acids from frozen tissue. Specimens were designated as high priority during sequencing. We determined the interval between biopsy and NGS results to evaluate whether the workflow reduced the pre-analytical period and in-laboratory turnaround time and allowed for rapid initiation of genotype-matched therapy.; RESULTS: Between January 2017 and May 2018, 21 patients participated in the expedited sequencing program. The median interval between biopsy and NGS results was 10.7 days. Six patients received results within 1 week of biopsy. Performing molecular analysis on frozen tissue and prioritizing sequencing and analysis of these specimens reduced the pre-analytical period from 3.5 to 1.3 days (p < 0.0001) and shortened in-laboratory turnaround time by 3 days (11.8 versus 8.4 business days, p < 0.0001). Ninety-three percent of patients with an actionable molecular alteration received first-line targeted therapy. The median time-to-initiation of treatment was 19.7 days from biopsy.; CONCLUSIONS: Sequencing and analyzing nucleic acids from frozen tissue is a practical strategy for shortening the time to matched therapy. The significant advantage of upfront treatment with targeted therapies in subsets of lung cancer patients provides rationale for developing workflows that accelerate comprehensive molecular analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: Ampullary carcinoma (AC) is a rare gastrointestinal cancer. Pathogenic germline alterations (PGAs) in BRCA2 and potentially targetable somatic alterations (SAs) in ERBB2 and ELF3 have been previously described in AC. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has implemented an opt-in strategy for germline testing (GT) and somatic testing (ST) for patients with AC to further evaluate the spectrum of PGAs and SAs.; METHODS: Forty-five patients with pathologically confirmed AC prospectively consented with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) test (410-468 genes). A subset of the cohort (23 of the 45 patients) also consented to GT with MSK-IMPACT (76-88 genes). Germline data for 21 of the remaining 22 patients who had not consented to GT were obtained in a de-identified fashion without clinical correlation. Clinicopathologic features, treatment histories, and survival data for consenting patients were collected and analyzed.; RESULTS: Pancreaticobiliary, intestinal, and mixed features of the 2 types were the primary pathologic subtypes of AC identified in this cohort. No difference in median overall survival was found between pathologic subtypes. Eight of 44 patients (18%) were identified as harboring pathogenic mutations in BRCA2, ATM, RAD50, and MUTYH. In addition, this study found a wide spectrum of SAs in genes such as KRAS, MDM2, ERBB2, ELF3, and PIK3CA. Two patients in the cohort underwent SA-targeted therapy, and 1 had a partial radiographic response.; CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in multiple somatic and germline genes were identified in this cohort. Significantly, actionable targets were identified in the tumors, and broader testing for PGAs and SAs should be considered for all patients with AC. © 2019 American Cancer Society.

AB The clinical management and therapy of many solid tumor malignancies depends on detection of medically actionable or diagnostically relevant genetic variation. However, a principal challenge for genetic assays from tumors is the fragmented and chemically damaged state of DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. From highly fragmented DNA and RNA there is no current technology for generating long-range DNA sequence data as is required to detect genomic structural variation or long-range genotype phasing. We have developed a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture approach for FFPE samples that we call Fix-C, which is similar in concept to Hi-C. Fix-C enables structural variation detection from archival FFPE samples. This method was applied to 15 clinical adenocarcinoma- and sarcoma-positive control specimens spanning a broad range of tumor purities. In this panel, Fix-C analysis achieves a 90% concordance rate with fluorescence in situ hybridization assays, the current clinical gold standard. In addition, novel structural variation undetected by other methods could be identified, and long-range chromatin configuration information recovered from these FFPE samples harboring highly degraded DNA. This powerful approach will enable detailed resolution of global genome rearrangement events during cancer progression from FFPE material and will inform the development of targeted molecular diagnostic assays for patient care.

We sought to describe the extent to which individuals who decline genetic counselling reported decisional conflict or struggled to make a decision to pursue genomic testing.; METHODS: We administered a 100-item survey to 3037 individuals who consented to the Return of Actionable Variants Empirical study, a genomic medicine implementation study supported by the National Institutes of Health (USA) eMERGE consortium. The primary outcomes of interest were self-reported decisional conflict about the decision to participate in the study and time required to reach a decision.; RESULTS: We received 2895 completed surveys (response rate=95.3%), and of these respondents 97.8% completed the decisional conflict scale in its entirety. A majority of individuals (63%) had minimal or no decisional conflict about the pursuit of genomic sequencing and were able to reach a decision quickly (78%). Multivariable logistic regression analyses identified several characteristics associated with decisional conflict, including lower education, lower health literacy, lower self-efficacy in coping, lack of prior experience with genetic testing, not discussing study participation with a family member or friend, and being male.; CONCLUSION: As genomic sequencing is used more widely, genetic counselling resources may not be sufficient to meet demand. Our results challenge the notion that all individuals need genetic counselling in order to make an informed decision about genomic sequencing. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB INTRODUCTION: Half of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) regardless of anatomic location harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements and overexpress anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein. The wide application of next-generation sequencing and the clinical benefit to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have opened new opportunities for investigation of ALK-negative IMTs.; METHODS: In this study, we have investigated a series of pediatric and adult thoracic IMTs for abnormalities in a wide spectrum of actionable kinases by applying a variety of molecular and next-generation sequencing techniques, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), targeted RNA sequencing, and NanoString assay.; RESULTS: There were 33 patients with thoracic IMTs, including five children; their mean age was 37. The tumors showed a monomorphic spindle cell phenotype, except for one with an epithelioid morphologic pattern and moderate to severe atypia. By immunohistochemistry, 24 tumors were ALK positive, and 19 of the 24 showed ALK rearrangements and one ret proto-oncogene gene (RET) rearrangement by FISH. RNA sequencing was performed in the remaining four cases lacking ALK abnormalities by FISH, revealing ALK fusions involving tropomyosin 4 gene (TMP4) and echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 gene (EML4) as partner in three cases. NanoString assay was performed in the remaining case, revealing ALK alternative transcription initiation (ALKATI). Nine cases lacking ALK abnormalities were further tested by FISH or targeted RNA sequencing, revealing ROS1 rearrangement in six cases and ETS variant 6 gene (ETV6)-neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 gene (NTRK3) fusion in three cases, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: By using a battery of complementary molecular techniques, we have shown that all the thoracic IMTs harbored a tyrosine kinase abnormality, with 30% involving a kinase gene other than ALK, including ROS1, NTRK3, and RET gene fusions. We have also described for the first time ALKATI-induced ALK oncogenic activation in IMTs. Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB PURPOSE: GNAQ mutations have been identified in port wine stains (both syndromic and nonsyndromic) and melanocytic ocular neoplasms. This study investigates the presence of GNAQ mutations in diffuse (those associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome [SWS]) and solitary choroidal hemangiomas.; PARTICIPANTS: Tissue from 11 patients with the following diagnoses: port wine stain (n= 3), diffuse choroidal hemangioma (n= 1), solitary choroidal hemangioma (n= 6), and choroidal nevus (n= 1).; METHODS: Ten specimens were interrogated with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets, a hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay for targeted deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of 468 key cancer genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. Digital polymerase chain reaction was used to detect GNAQ Q209 mutation in 1 specimen.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of GNAQ codon-specific mutation.; RESULTS: Activating somatic GNAQ mutations (c.547C > T; p.Arg183Cys) were found in 100% (3 of 3) of the port wine stain and in the diffuse choroidal hemangioma. Somatic GNAQ mutations (c.626A > T; p.Gln209Leu) were found in 100% (6 of 6) of the solitary choroidal hemangiomas and (c.626A > C; p.Gln209Pro) in the choroidal nevus.; CONCLUSIONS: GNAQ mutations occur in both diffuse and solitary hemangiomas, although at distinct codons. An R183 codon is mutant in diffuse choroidal hemangiomas, consistent with other Sturge-Weber vascular malformations. By contrast, solitary choroidal hemangiomas have mutations in the Q209 codon, similar to other intraocular melanocytic neoplasms. Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB With the use of genetic technology, researchers have the potential to inform medical diagnoses and treatment in actionable ways. Accurate variant interpretation is a necessary condition for the utility of genetic technology to unfold. This relies on the ability to access large genomic datasets so that comparisons can be made between variants of interest. This can only be successful if DNA and medical data are donated by large numbers of people to 'research', including clinical, non-profit and for-profit research initiatives, in order to be accessed by scientists and clinicians worldwide. The objective of the 'Your DNA, Your Say' global survey is to explore public attitudes, values and opinions towards willingness to donate and concerns regarding the donation of one's personal data for use by others. Using a representative sample of 8967 English-speaking publics from the UK, the USA, Canada and Australia, we explore the characteristics of people who are unwilling (n = 1426) to donate their DNA and medical information, together with an exploration of their reasons. Understanding this perspective is important for making sense of the interaction between science and society. It also helps to focus engagement initiatives on the issues of concern to some publics.

AB The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has been providing data to organizations participating in a range of innovation models to help them implement interventions and to provide feedback on performance. The authors studied 18 CMS models to gain a better understanding of factors contributing to model participants' use or nonuse of CMS-provided data. Factors that contribute to greater use include providing data that participants view as actionable, some type of accountability for performance, robust learning support, participants having resources to work with the data, and soliciting ongoing feedback about the data and related learning needs. Factors that discourage data uptake include time lag, lack of aggregated multi-payer data, exclusion of data for sensitive diagnoses, and small sample sizes. Claims-based data from payers can be an important source of information to innovation model participants. Lessons from this study can increase the usefulness of such data.

AB MOTIVATION: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Tumors, even of the same histopathological subtype, exhibit a high genotypic diversity that impedes therapy stratification and that hence must be accounted for in the treatment decision-making process.; RESULTS: Here, we present ClinOmicsTrailbc, a comprehensive visual analytics tool for breast cancer decision support that provides a holistic assessment of standard-of-care targeted drugs, candidates for drug repositioning, and immunotherapeutic approaches. To this end, our tool analyzes and visualizes clinical markers and (epi-)genomics and transcriptomics datasets to identify and evaluate the tumor's main driver mutations, the tumor mutational burden, activity patterns of core cancer-relevant pathways, drug-specific biomarkers, the status of molecular drug targets, and pharmacogenomic influences. In order to demonstrate ClinOmicsTrailbc's rich functionality, we present three case studies highlighting various ways in which ClinOmicsTrailbc can support breast cancer precision medicine. ClinOmicsTrailbc is a powerful integrated visual analytics tool for breast cancer research in general and for therapy stratification in particular, assisting oncologists to find the best possible treatment options for their breast cancer patients based on actionable, evidence-based results.; AVAILABILITY: ClinOmicsTrailbc can be freely accessed at https://clinomicstrail.bioinf.uni-sb.de.; SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. © The Author(s) (2019).

AB BACKGROUND: Patents are important intellectual property protecting technological innovations that inspire efficient research and development in biomedicine. The number of awarded patents serves as an important indicator of economic growth and technological innovation. Researchers have mined patents to characterize the focuses and trends of technological innovations in many fields.; OBJECTIVE: To expand patent mining to biomedicine and facilitate future resource allocation in biomedical research for the United States, we analyzed US patent documents to determine the focuses and trends of protected technological innovations across the entire disease landscape.; METHODS: We analyzed more than 5 million US patent documents between 1995 and 2017, using summary statistics and dynamic topic modeling. More specifically, we investigated the disease coverage and latent topics in patent documents over time. We also incorporated the patent data into the calculation of our recently developed Research Opportunity Index (ROI) and Public Health Index (PHI), to recalibrate the resource allocation in biomedical research.; RESULTS: Our analysis showed that protected technological innovations have been primarily focused on socioeconomically critical diseases such as "other cancers" (malignant neoplasm of head, face, neck, abdomen, pelvis, or limb; disseminated malignant neoplasm; Merkel cell carcinoma; and malignant neoplasm, malignant carcinoid tumors, neuroendocrine tumor, and carcinoma in situ of an unspecified site), diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The United States has significantly improved resource allocation to biomedical research and development over the past 17 years, as illustrated by the decreasing PHI. Diseases with positive ROI, such as ankle and foot fracture, indicate potential research opportunities for the future. Development of novel chemical or biological drugs and electrical devices for diagnosis and disease management is the dominating topic in patented inventions.; CONCLUSIONS: This multifaceted analysis of patent documents provides a deep understanding of the focuses and trends of technological innovations in disease management in patents. Our findings offer insights into future research and innovation opportunities and provide actionable information to facilitate policy makers, payers, and investors to make better evidence-based decisions regarding resource allocation in biomedicine. ©Ming Huang, Maryam Zolnoori, Joyce E Balls-Berry, Tabetha A Brockman, Christi A Patten, Lixia Yao.

AB BACKGROUND: Investigations into person-specific predictors of stress have typically taken either a population-level nomothetic approach or an individualized ideographic approach. Nomothetic approaches can quickly identify predictors but can be hindered by the heterogeneity of these predictors across individuals and time. Ideographic approaches may result in more predictive models at the individual level but require a longer period of data collection to identify robust predictors.; OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to compare predictors of stress identified through nomothetic and ideographic models and to assess whether sequentially combining nomothetic and ideographic models could yield more accurate and actionable predictions of stress than relying on either model. At the same time, we sought to maintain the interpretability necessary to retrieve individual predictors of stress despite using nomothetic models.; METHODS: Data collected in a 1-year observational study of 79 participants performing low levels of exercise were used. Physical activity was continuously and objectively monitored by actigraphy. Perceived stress was recorded by participants via daily ecological momentary assessments on a mobile app. Environmental variables including daylight time, temperature, and precipitation were retrieved from the public archives. Using these environmental, actigraphy, and mobile assessment data, we built machine learning models to predict individual stress ratings using linear, decision tree, and neural network techniques employing nomothetic and ideographic approaches. The accuracy of the approaches for predicting individual stress ratings was compared based on classification errors.; RESULTS: Across the group of patients, an individual's recent history of stress ratings was most heavily weighted in predicting a future stress rating in the nomothetic recurrent neural network model, whereas environmental factors such as temperature and daylight, as well as duration and frequency of bouts of exercise, were more heavily weighted in the ideographic models. The nomothetic recurrent neural network model was the highest performing nomothetic model and yielded 72% accuracy for an 80%/20% train/test split. Using the same 80/20 split, the ideographic models yielded 75% accuracy. However, restricting ideographic models to participants with more than 50 valid days in the training set, with the same 80/20 split, yielded 85% accuracy.; CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that for some applications, nomothetic models may be useful for yielding higher initial performance while still surfacing personalized predictors of stress, before switching to ideographic models upon sufficient data collection. ©Alan Rozet, Ian M Kronish, Joseph E Schwartz, Karina W Davidson.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is limited research exploring the relationship between design and patient safety outcomes, especially in maternal and neonatal care. We employed design thinking methodology to understand how the design of labor and delivery units impacts safety and identified spaces and systems where improvements are needed.; STUDY DESIGN: Site visits were conducted at 10 labor and delivery units in California. A multidisciplinary team collected data through observations, measurements, and clinician interviews. In parallel, research was conducted regarding current standards and codes for building new hospitals.; RESULTS: Designs of labor and delivery units are heterogeneous, lacking in consistency regarding environmental factors that may impact safety and outcomes. Building codes do not take into consideration workflow, human factors, and patient and clinician experience. Attitude of hospital staff may contribute to improving safety through design. Three areas in need of improvement and actionable through design emerged: (1) blood availability for hemorrhage management, (2) appropriate space for neonatal resuscitation, and (3) restocking and organization methods of equipment and supplies.; CONCLUSION: Design thinking could be implemented at various stages of health care facility building projects and during retrofits of existing units. Through this approach, we may be able to improve hospital systems and environmental factors. Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

AB Inhibition of bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) protein family members, including BRD4, decreases the expression of c-MYC and other key oncogenic factors and also significantly induces histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) expression. On the basis of the role of HDAC6 in malignant pathogenesis, we hypothesized that rational cotargeting of HDAC6 and BET family proteins may represent a novel approach that yields synergistic antimyeloma activity. We used genetic and pharmacologic approaches to selectively impair HDAC6 and BET function and evaluated the consequential impact on myeloma pathogenesis. These studies identified HDAC6 upregulation as an efficacy reducing mechanism for BET inhibitors because antagonizing HDAC6 activity synergistically enhanced the activity of JQ1 in a panel of multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and primary CD138+ cells obtained from patients with MM. The synergy of this therapeutic combination was linked to significant reductions in c-MYC expression and increases in apoptosis induction. Administration of the clinical HDAC6 inhibitor ricolinostat was very well tolerated and significantly augmented the in vivo antimyeloma activity of JQ1. Ex vivo pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated that the combination of JQ1 and ricolinostat led to significantly lower MM cell proliferation and increased apoptosis and diminished expression of c-MYC and BCL-2. These data demonstrate that cotargeting of HDAC6 and BET family members is a novel and clinically actionable approach to augment the efficacy of both classes of agents that warrants further investigation. © 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) and CO2. The discovery of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in several malignancies has brought to the approval of drugs targeting IDH1/2 mutants in cancers. Here, we summarized findings addressing the impact of IDH mutants in rare pathologies and focused on the relevance of non-mutated IDH enzymes in tumors. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the enzymatic inhibition of IDHs may have therapeutic potentials also in wild-type IDH cancers. Moreover, IDHs inhibition could enhance the efficacy of canonical cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, target therapy, and radiotherapy. However, further studies are required to elucidate whether IDH proteins are diagnostic/prognostic markers, instrumental for tumor initiation and maintenance, and could be exploited as targets for anticancer therapy. The development of wild-type IDH inhibitors is expected to improve our understanding of a potential non-oncogenic addition to IDH1/2 activities and to fully address their applicability in combination with other therapies.

AB Glioblastoma therapies have remained elusive due to limitations in understanding mechanisms of growth and survival of the tumorigenic population. Using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches in patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSCs) to interrogate function of the coding genome, we identify actionable pathways responsible for growth, which reveal the gene-essential circuitry of GBM stemness and proliferation. In particular, we characterize members of the SOX transcription factor family, SOCS3, USP8, and DOT1L, and protein ufmylation as important for GSC growth. Additionally, we reveal mechanisms of temozolomide resistance that could lead to combination strategies. By reaching beyond static genome analysis of bulk tumors, with a genome-wide functional approach, we reveal genetic dependencies within a broad range of biological processes to provide increased understanding of GBM growth and treatment resistance.

AB BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. Survival remains poor among histologically poor responders, and there is a need to identify them at diagnosis to avoid delivering ineffective therapy. Genetic variation contributes to a wide range of response and toxicity related to chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to use sequencing of blood cells to identify germline haplotypes strongly associated with drug resistance in osteosarcoma patients.; METHODS: We used sequencing data from two patient datasets, from Inova Hospital and the NCI TARGET. We explored the effect of mutation hotspots, in the form of haplotypes, associated with relapse outcome. We then mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these haplotypes to genes and pathways. We also performed a targeted analysis of mutations in Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporter (DMET) genes associated with tumor necrosis and survival.; RESULTS: We found intronic and intergenic hotspot regions from 26 genes common to both the TARGET and INOVA datasets significantly associated with relapse outcome. Among significant results were mutations in genes belonging to AKR enzyme family, cell-cell adhesion biological process and the PI3K pathways; as well as variants in SLC22 family associated with both tumor necrosis and overall survival. The SNPs from our results were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Our results included known as well as novel SNPs and haplotypes in genes associated with drug resistance.; CONCLUSION: We show that combining next generation sequencing data from multiple datasets and defined clinical data can better identify relevant pathway associations and clinically actionable variants, as well as provide insights into drug response mechanisms.

AB Identification of key molecular networks involved in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) growth and metastasis will increase our mechanistic understanding of this disease and pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. The study by Khawaled and colleagues points to a direct antimetastatic function of WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) in TNBC and identifies the Myc/miR-146a/fibronectin axis as a molecular mediator of the tumor-suppressive function of WWOX. This information can potentially be used to identify actionable nodes for targeting TNBC, a breast cancer subtype otherwise characterized by the absence of markers.See related article by Khawaled et al., p. 1784. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Acidosis is a fundamental feature of the tumor microenvironment, which directly regulates tumor cell invasion by affecting immune cell function, clonal cell evolution, and drug resistance. Despite the important association of tumor microenvironment acidosis with tumor cell invasion, relatively little is known regarding which areas within a tumor are acidic and how acidosis influences gene expression to promote invasion. Here, we injected a labeled pH-responsive peptide to mark acidic regions within tumors. Surprisingly, acidic regions were not restricted to hypoxic areas and overlapped with highly proliferative, invasive regions at the tumor-stroma interface, which were marked by increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and degradation of the basement membrane. RNA-seq analysis of cells exposed to low pH conditions revealed a general rewiring of the transcriptome that involved RNA splicing and enriched for targets of RNA binding proteins with specificity for AU-rich motifs. Alternative splicing of Mena and CD44, which play important isoform-specific roles in metastasis and drug resistance, respectively, was sensitive to histone acetylation status. Strikingly, this program of alternative splicing was reversed in vitro and in vivo through neutralization experiments that mitigated acidic conditions. These findings highlight a previously underappreciated role for localized acidification of tumor microenvironment in the expression of an alternative splicing-dependent tumor invasion program. SIGNIFICANCE: This study expands our understanding of acidosis within the tumor microenvironment and indicates that acidosis induces potentially therapeutically actionable changes to alternative splicing. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a huge reservoir of potential cancer targets. Such "onco-lncRNAs" have resisted traditional RNAi methods, but CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing now promises functional screens at high throughput and low cost. The unique biology of lncRNAs demands screening strategies distinct from protein-coding genes. The first such screens have identified hundreds of onco-lncRNAs promoting cell proliferation and drug resistance. Ongoing developments will further improve screen performance and translational relevance. This Review aims to highlight the potential of CRISPR screening technology for discovering new onco-lncRNAs, and to guide molecular oncologists wishing to apply it to their cancer of interest.

AB Background: Tailored care management requires effectively segmenting heterogeneous populations into actionable subgroups. Using patient reported data may help identify groups with care needs not revealed in traditional clinical data.; Methods: We conducted retrospective segmentation analyses of 9,617 Kaiser Permanente Colorado members age 65 or older at risk for high utilization due to advanced illness and geriatric issues who had completed a Medicare Health Risk Assessment (HRA) between 2014 and 2017. We separately applied clustering methods and latent class analyses (LCA) to HRA variables to identify groups of individuals with actionable profiles that may inform care management. HRA variables reflected self-reported quality of life, mood, activities of daily living (ADL), urinary incontinence, falls, living situation, isolation, financial constraints, and advance directives. We described groups by demographic, utilization, and clinical characteristics.; Results: Cluster analyses produced a 14-cluster solution and LCA produced an 8-class solution reflecting groups with identifiable care needs. Example groups included: frail individuals with memory impairment less likely to live independently, those with poor physical and mental well-being and ADL limitations, those with ADL limitations but good mental and physical well-being, and those with few health or other limitations differentiated by age, presence or absence of a documented advance directive, and tobacco use.; Conclusions: Segmenting populations with complex care needs into meaningful subgroups can inform tailored care management. We found groups produced through cluster methods to be more intuitive, but both methods produced actionable information. Applying these methods to patient-reported data may make care more efficient and patient-centered.

AB BACKGROUND: In this research paper we report on the quality of feedback provided in the logbooks of pre-clinical undergraduate students based on a model of 'actionable feedback'. Feedback to clinical learners about their performance is crucial to their learning, which ultimately impacts on their development into competent clinicians. Due to students' concerns regarding the inconsistency and quality of feedback provided by clinicians, a structured feedback improvement strategy to move feedback forward was added to the clinical skills logbook. The instrument was also extended for peer assessment. This study aims to assess the quality of feedback using the deliberate practice framework.; METHODS: A feedback scoring system was used to retrospectively assess the quality of tutor and peer logbook feedback provided to second and third year medical students to identify deliberate practice components i.e. task, performance gap and action plan. The sample consisted of 425secondyear and 600 third year feedback responses over a year.; RESULTS: All three deliberate practice components were observed in the majority of the written feedback for both classes. The frequency was higher in peer (83%, 89%) than tutor logbook assessments (51%, 67%) in both classes respectively. Average tutor and peer task, gap and action feedback scores ranged from 1.84-2.07 and 1.93-2.21 respectively. The overall quality of feedback provided by the tutor and peer was moderate and less specific (average score<or=2). The absence of the three components was noted in only 1% of the feedback responses in both 2nd and 3rd year.; CONCLUSION: This study found that adding in a feed-forward strategy to the logbooks increased the overall quality of tutor and peer feedback as the task, gap and action plans were described. Deliberate practice framework provides an objective assessment of tutor and peer feedback quality and can be used for faculty development and training. The findings from our study suggest that the ratings from the tool can also be used as guidelines to provide feedback providers with feedback on the quality of feedback they provided. This includes specifically describing a task, performance gap and providing a learning plan as feed-forward to enhance feedback given.

AB Qualitative and quantitative determination of fatty acids in plasma is of extreme importance as these are indicators of metabolic diseases. In this work, a sensitive and rugged method for detecting and quantifying fatty acids (as fatty acid methyl ester derivatives, FAMEs) in blood plasma was developed. The use of large-volume injection (LVI) gas chromatography-vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy (GC-VUV) for analysis of fatty acids in blood plasma allowed the injection of higher sample volumes to accommodate sufficient analyte on-column for necessary detection ranges with a run time of 45 min. Calibration curves exhibited consistent linearity and reproducibility and were used along with internal standards for the quantification of 11 saturated and 21 unsaturated fatty acids. Intra-day and inter-day (n = 6) CVs had an average of 5 and 6%, respectively, and recoveries an average of 105%. The concentrations of EPA, DHA, and AA, as well as the omega-3 index and omega-6/omega-3 ratio, were calculated and compared with clinically actionable measurement ranges. Due to the use of LVI, the more volatile analyte (C8:0) was lost and therefore impossible to quantify. The volatility cutoff was determined to be the C10:0 analyte with a molecular weight of 186.295 g/mol. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CONTEXT: Following major surgery, post-operative hyperglycemia (POHG) is associated with suboptimal outcomes, among diabetics and non-diabetics. A specific genetic variant, rs13266634 (c.973C>T; p.ARG325TRP) in zinc transporter SLC30A8/ZnT8, is associated with protection against Type-2 Diabetes, suggesting it may be actionable for predicting and preventing POHG.; OBJECTIVE: To determine independent and mediated influences of a genetic variant on POHG in patients undergoing a model major operation, complex abdominal ventral hernia repair (cVHR).; PATIENTS AND METHODS: For 110 patients (mean BMI 34.9±5.8, T2D history 28%) undergoing cVHR at a tertiary referral center (January 2012 to March 2017), multivariate regression was used to correlate the rs13266634 variant to pre-operative clinical, laboratory and imaging-based indices of liver steatosis and central abdominal adiposity to POHG. Causal Mediation Analysis (CMA) was used to determine direct and mediated contributions of SLC30A8/ZnT8 status to POHG.; RESULTS: Variant rs13266634 was present in 61 patients (55.4%). In univariate models, when compared to patients with rs13266634, the homozygous wild-genotype (C/C, n=49) was associated with significantly higher risks of POHG (OR= 0.30 95%CI =0.14, 0.67, P=0.0038). Multivariate regression indicated that the association was independent (OR= 0.39 95%CI 0.15-0.97, p=0.040). In addition, CMA suggested that rs13266634 protects against POHG directly and indirectly through its influence on liver steatosis and central adiposity.; CONCLUSIONS: In medically complex patients undergoing major operations, the rs13266634 variant protects against POHG and its associated outcomes, through independent and mediated contributions. In C/C patients undergoing major operations, SLC30A8/ZnT8 may prove useful to stratify risk of POHG and potentially as a therapeutic target. Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.

AB OBJECTIVES: Develop a built environment mapping workflow. Implement the workflow in the emergency department (ED). Demonstrate the actionable representations of the data that can be collected using this workflow.; BACKGROUND: The design of the healthcare built environment impacts the delivery of patient care and operational efficiency. Studying this environment presents a series of challenges due to the limitations associated with existing technology such as radio-frequency identification. The authors designed a customized mapping workflow to collect high-resolution spatial, temporal, and activity data to improve healthcare environments, with emphasis on patient safety and operational efficiency.; METHOD: A large, urban, academic medical center ED collaborated with an architecture firm to create a data collection, and mapping workflow using ArcGIS tools and data collectors. The authors developed tools to collect data on the entire ED, as well as individual patients, physicians, and nurses. Advanced visual representations were created from the master data set.; RESULTS: In 48 consecutive hourly snapshots, 5,113 data points were collected on patients, physicians, nurses, and other staff reflecting the operations of the ED. Separately, 84 patients, 10 attending physicians, 10 resident physicians, and 17 nurses were tracked.; CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained from this pilot study were used to create advanced visual representations of the ED environment. This cost-effective ED mapping workflow may be applied to other healthcare settings. Further investigation to evaluate the benefits of this high-resolution data is required.

AB Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. African Americans are disproportionately affected by CRC. Our hypothesis is that driver genes with known and novel mutations have an impact on CRC outcome in this population. Therefore, we investigated the variants' profiles in a panel of 15 CRC genes.; Patients & Methods: Colorectal specimens (n=140) were analyzed by targeted exome sequencing using an Ion Torrent platform. Detected variants were validated in 36 samples by Illumina sequencing. The novel status of the validated variants was determined by comparison to publicly available databases. Annotated using ANNOVAR and in-silico functional analysis of these variants were performed to determine likely pathogenic variants.; Results: Overall, 121 known and novel variants were validated: APC (27%), AMER1 (3%), ARID1 (7%), MSH3 (12%), MSH6 (10%), BRAF (4%), KRAS (6%), FBXW7 (4%), PIK3CA (6%), SMAD4 (5%), SOX9 (2%), TCF7L2 (2%), TGFBR2 (5%), TP53 (7%). From these validated variants, 12% were novel in 8 genes (AMER1, APC, ARID1A, BRAF, MSH6, PIK3CA, SMAD4, and TCF7L2). Of the validated variants, 23% were non-synonymous, 14% were stopgains, 24% were synonymous and 39% were intronic variants.; Conclusion: We here report the specifics of variants' profiles of African Americans with colorectal lesions. Validated variants showed that Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs) APC and ARID1 and DNA Mismatch repair (MMR) genes MSH3 and MSH6 are the genes with the highest numbers of validated variants. Oncogenes KRAS and PIK3CA are also altered and likely participate in the increased proliferative potential of the mutated colonic epithelial cells in this population.

AB Importance: Little progress in pediatric cancer treatment has been noted in the past decade, urging the development of novel therapeutic strategies for adolescents and children with hard-to-treat cancers. Use of comprehensive molecular profiling in the clinical management of children and adolescents with cancer appears a suitable approach to improve patient care and outcomes, particularly for hard-to-treat cases.; Objective: To assess the feasibility of identifying potentially actionable mutations using next-generation sequencing-based assays in a clinically relevant time frame.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study reports the results of the TRICEPS study, a prospective genome sequencing study conducted in Quebec, Canada. Participants, aged 18 years or younger at diagnosis, with refractory or relapsed childhood and adolescent cancers were enrolled from April 2014 through January 2018. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of matched tumor normal samples and RNA sequencing of tumor were performed to identify single-nucleotide variants, fusion transcripts, differential gene expression, and copy number alterations. Results reviewed by a team of experts were further annotated, synthesized into a report, and subsequently discussed in a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Molecular profiling of pediatric patients with hard-to-treat cancer, identification of actionable and targetable alteration needed for the management of these patients, and proposition of targeted and personalized novel therapeutic strategies.; Results: A total of 84 patients with hard-to-treat cancers were included in the analysis. These patients had a mean (range) age of 10.1 (1-21) years and a similar proportion of male (45 [54%]) and female (39 [46%]). Sixty-two patients (74%) had suitable tissues for multimodal molecular profiling (WES and RNA sequencing). The process from DNA or RNA isolation to genomic sequencing and data analysis steps took a median (range) of 24 (4-41) days. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in 54 of 62 patients (87%). Actions were taken in 22 of 54 patients (41%), and 18 (33%) either were on a second or third line of treatment, were in remission, or had stable disease and thus no actions were taken.; Conclusions and Relevance: Incorporating genomic sequencing into the management of hard-to-treat childhood and adolescent cancers appeared feasible; molecular profiling may enable the identification of potentially actionable alterations with clinical implications for most patients, including targeted therapy and clinically relevant information of diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring significance.

AB CONTEXT: Leaders in public health have made great advances in workforce development over the past 30 years, while shifting from an emphasis based in training on individual, technical skills to a more holistic development approach, which boosts crosscutting skills. Efforts to increase public health workforce capabilities remain focused on workers as individuals, rather than the workforce as a collective unit.; PROGRAM: Research has shown that a strategic adult learning approach can improve both individual capabilities and the collective performance of the workforce, which can be explained using social cognitive theory and the concept of collective efficacy, or the collective belief of workers in the ability of the group to succeed. We explain how a prior training program pushed us to explore this approach.; IMPLEMENTATION: The proposed approach covers proposed implementation strategies to build collective efficacy as part of existing workforce development initiatives, with a focus on 5 key steps.; EVALUATION: Experience in fields as diverse as sports psychology and organizational development has shown that it is possible to evaluate changes in collective efficacy using measures that can be adopted in public health.; DISCUSSION: Adjusting existing public health workforce development initiatives to build collective efficacy can help link workforce self-confidence to performance. More actionable data are needed to determine the best methods for achieving those goals in the field of public health.

AB BACKGROUND: Web-based platforms can be powerful tools for research dissemination. By leveraging the advantages of mass media and interpersonal channels of communication, Web-based dissemination platforms may improve awareness about, and subsequent adoption of, evidence-based practices (EBPs). Digital dissemination strategies can augment traditional dissemination models, improving stakeholder access to digestible and actionable information and promoting translation of EBPs.; OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the reach and content of the Web presence of a National Institute on Drug Abuse Center of Excellence and how it is used to disseminate research related to digital behavioral health approaches.; METHODS: The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH) has a website and regularly updated Facebook and Twitter accounts. The website features include summaries of digital behavioral health approaches and related empirical literature, a blog feed focused on the state of the science and technology concerning digital health care approaches, and a newsletter about Center activities. We extracted website usage metrics from Google Analytics and follower counts from social media accounts for the period from March 1, 2013, to July 17, 2018.; RESULTS: Since the implementation of analytic tracking, 70,331 users have initiated 96,995 sessions on the CTBH website. The website includes summaries of 86 digital therapeutic programs, encompassing 447 empirical articles. There are 1160 posts in the CTBH blog feed, including 180 summaries of scholarly articles. The Twitter and Facebook accounts have 577 and 1500 followers, respectively. The newsletter has reached a growing subscriber network and has a high open rate relative to industry standards.; CONCLUSIONS: The CTBH Web presence serves as a model for how to leverage accessible and easily updatable digital platforms as research dissemination channels. Digital dissemination tools can augment traditional dissemination strategies to promote awareness about evidence-based digital therapeutic approaches for behavioral health and health care more broadly. ©Sarah E Lord, Katherine M Seavey, Sonia D Oren, Alan J Budney, Lisa A Marsch.

AB CONTEXT: Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), highlighting the need for targeted risk minimization interventions.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of dietary interventions on CVD risk in adults with SCI.; METHODS: A systematic literature review of studies investigating the impact of dietary intervention on CVD risk in SCI individuals was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. CASP checklists were used for critical appraisal, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality criteria checklist (QCC) for determining risk of bias and the GRADE approach to ascertain the quality of evidence of the outcomes. The results were reported descriptively.; RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included from the identified 862 articles. Dietary intervention strategies varied across all studies, as did the outcome measures. Adult learning theories were not considered. The lack of controlled trials (two only) meant that while some interventions proved useful, risk of bias was high. Outcome measures were assessed as low to very low quality again identifying that this area is highly under-researched.; CONCLUSION: Despite documented evidence of the benefits of diet on CVD risk reduction, this review has identified a dearth of research in SCI. Nonetheless, the review emphasizes the potential of diet in conjunction with exercise in minimizing CVD risk in SCI. Further good quality research backed by robust data collection, simple, actionable strategies and knowledge translation techniques are essential to ascertain the effects of dietary intervention in lowering CVD risk in SCI.

AB To inform governmental discussions on the nature of a revised Strategic Plan for Biodiversity of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), we reviewed the relevant literature and assessed the framing of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets in the current strategic plan. We asked international experts from nongovernmental organizations, academia, government agencies, international organizations, research institutes, and the CBD to score the Aichi Targets and their constituent elements against a set of specific, measurable, ambitious, realistic, unambiguous, scalable, and comprehensive criteria (SMART based, excluding time bound because all targets are bound to 2015 or 2020). We then investigated the relationship between these expert scores and reported progress toward the target elements by using the findings from 2 global progress assessments (Global Biodiversity Outlook and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). We analyzed the data with ordinal logistic regressions. We found significant positive relationships (p<0.05) between progress and the extent to which the target elements were perceived to be measurable, realistic, unambiguous, and scalable. There was some evidence of a relationship between progress and specificity of the target elements, but no relationship between progress and ambition. We are the first to show associations between progress and the extent to which the Aichi Targets meet certain SMART criteria. As negotiations around the post-2020 biodiversity framework proceed, decision makers should strive to ensure that new or revised targets are effectively structured and clearly worded to allow the translation of targets into actionable policies that can be successfully implemented nationally, regionally, and globally. © 2019 The Authors.

   discusiones gubernamentales sobre la naturaleza de una revision del Plan
   Estrategico para la Biodiversidad del Convenio sobre la Diversidad
   Biologica (CBD, en ingles), revisamos la literatura relevante y
   evaluamos el marco de 20 Objetivos de Biodiversidad de Aichi en el plan
   estrategico actual. Le pedimos a expertos internacionales de
   organizaciones no gubernamentales, de la academia, de agencias
   gubernamentales, organizaciones internacionales, de institutos de
   investigacion y de la CBD que puntuaran los Objetivos de Aichi y sus
   elementos constituyentes frente a un conjunto de criterios especificos,
   medibles, ambiciosos, realistas (basados en SMART [las iniciales en
   ingles] y excluyendo aquellos limitados por el tiempo, pues todos los
   objetivos estan limitados al 2015 o al 2020), inequivocos, expansibles y
   completos (excluyendo aquellos limitados por el tiempo). Despues
   investigamos la relacion entre los puntajes de estos expertos y el
   progreso reportado hacia los elementos objetivo usando los resultados de
   dos valoraciones mundiales del progreso (el Pronostico Mundial de la
   Biodiversidad y la Plataforma Intergubernamental de Ciencia y Politica
   sobre la Biodiversidad y los Servicios Ambientales). Analizamos los
   datos con regresiones logisticas ordinales. Encontramos relaciones
   positivas significativas (p<0.05) entre el progreso y el alcance al que
   fueron percibidos como medibles, realistas, inequivocos y expansibles
   los elementos objetivo. Hubo algo de evidencia de la relacion entre el
   progreso y la ambicion. Somos los primeros en mostrar las asociaciones
   entre el progreso y la extension hasta la que los Objetivos de Aichi
   cumplen con ciertos criterios SMART. Conforme proceden las negociaciones
   en torno al marco de trabajo de biodiversidad post-2020, quienes toman
   las decisiones deberian esforzarse por asegurar que los objetivos nuevos
   o revisados esten estructurados efectivamente y redactados claramente
   para permitir la traduccion de los objetivos hacia politicas factibles
   que puedan implementarse exitosamente a nivel nacional, regional y
   mundial.

AB This article describes the origins and characteristics of an interdisciplinary multinational collaboration aimed at promoting and disseminating actionable evidence on the drivers of health in cities in Latin America and the Caribbean: The Network for Urban Health in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Wellcome Trust funded SALURBAL (Salud Urbana en America Latina, or Urban Health in Latin America) Project. Both initiatives have the goals of supporting urban policies that promote health and health equity in cities of the region while at the same time generating generalizable knowledge for urban areas across the globe. The processes, challenges, as well as the lessons learned to date in launching and implementing these collaborations, are described. By leveraging the unique features of the Latin American region (one of the most urbanized areas of the world with some of the most innovative urban policies), the aim is to produce generalizable knowledge about the links between urbanization, health, and environments and to identify effective ways to organize, design, and govern cities to improve health, reduce health inequalities, and maximize environmental sustainability in cities all over the world. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Since the conception of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975 there has been substantial progress regarding the education of learners with disabilities. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain for addressing the diverse needs of these learners and improving in- and out-of-school outcomes. This special issue focuses on an approach that holds promise for the delivery of interventions that are aligned to learners' social, emotional, behavioral, and learning needs - multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS). The four articles that comprise the special issue highlight the need for actionable information for schools implementing MTSS, early intervention for children with or at risk for disabilities, and an enhanced focus on intensive interventions. This introduction to the special issue provides information on the meeting that motivated the special issue, a summary of each of the four articles, and paths forward for early and sustained intervention for learners with or at risk for disabilities.

AB The current paper discusses the use of genomics in the context of the changing landscape of clinical practice and modern medicine. Medical practice has shifted considerably over the past few decades, from empirical to evidence-based to personalized medicine, and the transition from reliance on observation to measureable parameters. Scientific innovation is required to collect an ever-increasing number and variety of data points and sophisticated analyses capable of distilling vast datasets into meaningful information. The next phase of innovation seeks to personalize disease management, in particular through genomics in oncology. With expanding use of genomics in medicine, and several initiatives collecting genomic data at the population level, education of patients and physicians is critical for data utility. By combining genomic and clinical data, bioinformatics approaches can be applied to developing individualized or targeted therapies. Breast cancer provides an example through which to understand the evolution of genomic data from pure science to clinical utility. From intrinsic subtype classification to development of multigene panels estimating recurrence risk, new studies, such as the FLEX trial, will expand to evaluate the whole transcriptome of tumours. This approach will enable discovery of novel gene signatures and ultimately pave the way toward a personalized approach to breast cancer management. CONCLUSION: Despite the potential for genomics to personalize treatments, a number of challenges remain to fully integrate these types of large datasets in a manner that provides clinicians and patients with meaningful, actionable information. However, if challenges are addressed, precision medicine has the capacity to transform patient care. Copyright © 2019 by Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

AB OBJECTIVE: This paper describes our experience and outcomes from 54 cases presented to the (Molecular tumor board) MTB.; METHODS: 54 Cases presented between July 2017 and April 2018 were included in this analysis. These patients had different types of cancers that had either failed standard therapy or were expected to fail and physicians were looking for future options for anticipated progression. Patients who had obvious mutations and were candidates for Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry or Molecular Analysis for Treatment Choice clinical trials were not included. Oncologists presented the cases virtually and Foundation Medicine scientific and clinical team discussed the molecular pathways to find targeted options or trials. Tumor board attendees included oncologists, nurses, pharmacists, mid-level providers, residents and staff of the Cancer Center.; RESULTS: Amongst the 54 cases presented 81% had one or more potentially actionable alteration. 12 (22%) patients received genomically matched therapy as per MTB recommendations. Additional 13 (24%) patients have options available when they progress. Out of 12 patients who got treatment six are alive at the time of this analysis. Genomically matched therapy or Clinical Trials option were offered to the 46% of patients based on the MTB discussion.; CONCLUSION: More widespread use of molecular diagnostics, better physician education and multidisciplinary collaboration between the staff involved in diagnosis and treatment, as well as third party payers are necessary for consensus on treatment and care of oncology patients.

AB The Government of India has passed a notification making the non-reporting of tuberculosis (TB) by a clinical establishment a punishable offence. This article examines this move from an ethical standpoint. One of the main ethical concerns relates to the violation of patient confidentiality that may result from this. Also as regards improvement in patient care, there appears to be a poor cost-benefit ratio in terms of the actionable data obtained by this There may be possible adverse consequences by a limiting of access to care due to penalising of non-reporting. In terms of the bigger picture, the notification may lead to an increased tension between the private sector and Government. Moreover, it is the position of the authors that such a step distracts attention from the more important issues that plague TB care in India today.

AB Given the known association of gene fusions with solid tumor morbidity and the need to clarify the role of fusions in therapeutic, prognostic and diagnostic outcomes, we reviewed the positive yield rate for fusions in solid tumors using cases that were referred to our laboratory for clinical testing. We retrospectively evaluated results from 183 solid tumor samples that were received during a 24 month period for testing using the FusionSeq assay, an RNA-based Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel of 53 genes known to form fusions in solid tumors. Positive yield rate (actionable fusions) was evaluated for all samples tested, as a correlate for clinical utility. Twenty five fusions (actionable, variants of uncertain significance - VUS, and benign) were identified, of which 7 were classified as actionable gene fusions, resulting in an overall positive yield rate of 3.8% (7/183). Sixteen mostly novel fusions were classified and reported as VUSs. Five fusion events were classified as false positives, occurring due to mispriming or wild-type read through while 2 were classified as likely benign. Additionally 68% of fusions (17 of 25) detected in our study were present in prostate, colorectal, and gynecological cancers, suggesting that the frequency of fusions identified is dependent on specific tumor type. The high number of novel fusions identified highlights the potential for fusions in precision medicine. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a structured model for reflective journal writing (RJW) and a grading rubric as part of a student portfolio designed to help Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students create actionable goals. Methods. A structured, eight-domain format was developed to engage students in prioritization, identification, exploration, recollection, evaluation, and challenging/solidifying their own knowledge, while assembling an action plan for development (abbreviated using the acronym PIE-RECAP). After completing RJW using this model, students self-identified domains established by the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) that corresponded to their entries. A grading rubric was designed and normalized to require minimal training for use. RJW and other elements of student portfolios were implemented simultaneously across three cohorts (N=296). Twenty-one faculty and staff graders each evaluated 10 to 15 student journal entries. Results. Of 771 journal entries, 648 (84%) met expectations, while 123 (16%) needed to be rewritten. Students identified experiences that were meaningful to them and shared in their RJW entry the knowledge and/or information that they did not know prior to the experience. Common themes identified in the students' RJWs included: curricular experiences (12.7%), cocurricular experiences (18.4%), and experiential training (68.6%). Conclusion. The PIE-RECAP method can be used to guide students in RJW and identify CAPE domains in their personal and professional experiences in pharmacy school. The associated grading rubric can be used to evaluate students' RJW entries and assess their growth in curricular, cocurricular and affective domains relative to their progression.

AB Next-generation sequencing is enabling molecularly guided therapy for many cancer types, yet failure rates remain relatively high in pancreatic cancer (PC). The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of genomic profiling using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy samples to facilitate personalised therapy for PC. Ninty-five patients underwent additional research biopsies at the time of diagnostic EUS. Diagnostic formalin-fixed (FFPE) and fresh frozen EUS samples underwent DNA extraction, quantification and targeted gene sequencing. Whole genome (WGS) and RNA sequencing was performed as proof of concept. Only 2 patients (2%) with a diagnosis of PC had insufficient material for targeted sequencing in both FFPE and frozen specimens. Targeted panel sequencing (n=54) revealed mutations in PC genes (KRAS, GNAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4) in patients with histological evidence of PC, including potentially actionable mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRAF). WGS (n=5) of EUS samples revealed mutational signatures that are potential biomarkers of therapeutic responsiveness. RNA sequencing (n=35) segregated patients into clinically relevant molecular subtypes based on transcriptome. Integrated multi-omic analysis of PC using standard EUS guided biopsies offers clinical utility to guide personalized therapy and study the molecular pathology in all patients with PC.

AB A multidisciplinary team of experts took stock of the current state of affairs about many aspects of aphasia in India, including community burden, diagnostic assessment, therapy, rehabilitation, research, education, and advocacy. The broad spectrum of aphasiology was matched by the types of participants ranging from neurologists, speech-language pathologists, clinical psychologists, linguists, to experts in neuroimaging and computer sciences. Threadbare discussion in 16 sessions over 3 days leads to the identification of pressing problems and possible solutions. Many action plans have been envisaged and recommendations made. A few examples with high priority are community-based and hospital-based study incidence and prevalence of aphasia, development of test batteries for the assessment of many components of speech and communication in Indian languages which are validated on rigorous psychometric, and linguistic criteria, national registry for aphasia, educational modules about aphasia for different target groups, resources for advocacy and its training, a bank of research questions and outlines of research protocols for young professionals to pursue. The expert group will continue to oversee execution of some of the actionable plans in short and long term.

AB Objective: Integrating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) into electronic health records (EHRs) can improve patient-provider communication and delivery of care. However, new system implementation in health-care institutions is often accompanied by a change in clinical workflow and organizational culture. This study examines how well an EHR-integrated PRO system fits clinical workflows and individual needs of different provider groups within 2 clinics.; Materials and Methods: Northwestern Medicine developed and implemented an EHR-integrated PRO system within the orthopedics and oncology departments. We conducted interviews with 11 providers who had interacted with the system. Through thematic analysis, we synthesized themes regarding provider perspectives on clinical workflow, individual needs, and system features.; Results: Our findings show that EHR-integrated PROs facilitate targeted conversation with patients and automated triage for psychosocial care. However, physicians, psychosocial providers, and medical assistants faced different challenges in their use of the PRO system. Barriers mainly stemmed from a lack of actionable data, workflow disruption, technical issues, and a lack of incentives.; Discussion: This study sheds light on the ecosystem around EHR-integrated PRO systems (such as user needs and organizational factors). We present recommendations to address challenges facing PRO implementation, such as optimizing data collection and auto-referral processes, improving data visualizations, designing effective educational materials, and prioritizing the primary user group.; Conclusion: PRO integration into routine care can be beneficial but also require effective technology design and workflow configuration to reach full potential use. This study provides insights into how patient-generated health data can be better integrated into clinical practice and care delivery processes.

AB In genomic medicine, the familiarity and inexactness of the term "actionable" can lead to multiple interpretations and mistaken beliefs about realistic treatment options. As part of a larger study focusing on public attitudes toward policies for the return of secondary genomic results, we looked at how members of the lay public interpret the term "medically actionable" in the context of genetic testing. We also surveyed a convenience sample of oncologists as part of a separate study and asked them to define the term "medically actionable." After being provided with a definition of the term, 21 out of 60 (35%) layperson respondents wrote an additional action not specified in the provided definition (12 mentioned "cure" and 9 mentioned environment or behavioral change) and 17 (28%) indicated "something can be done" with no action specified. In contrast, 52 surveyed oncologists did not mention environment, behavioral change, or cure. Based on our findings, we propose that rather than using the term "actionable" alone, providers should also say "what they mean" to reduce miscommunication and confusion that could negatively impact medical decision-making. Lastly, to guide clinicians during patient- provider discussion about genetic test results, we provide examples of phrasing to facilitate clearer communication and understanding of the term "actionable." © 2018 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB Genome-wide sequencing may generate secondary findings (SFs). It is recommended that validated, clinically actionable SFs are reported back to patients/research participants. To explore publics' perspectives on the best ways to do this, we performed a vignette study among Finnish adults. Our aim was to explore how lay people react to different types of hypothetical genomic SFs. Participants received a hypothetical letter revealing a SF predisposing to a severe but actionable disease-cardiovascular disease (familial hypercholesterolemia, long QT syndrome) or cancer (Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Participants (N=29) wrote down their initial reactions, and discussed (N=23) these in focus groups. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Reactions to hypothetical SFs varied according to perceived severity and familiarity of the diseases. SFs for cancer were perceived as more threatening than for cardiovascular diseases, but less distressing than risk for psychiatric or neurological disorders, which participants spontaneously brought up. Illness severity in terms of lived experience, availability of treatment, stigma, and individual's responsibility to control risk were perceived to vary across these disease types. In addition to clinical validity and utility, SF reporting practices need to take into account potential familiarity and lay illness representations of different diseases. Illness representations may influence willingness to receive SFs, and individuals' reactions to this information. © 2018 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB Rationales for returning results from whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genetic testing have historically focused on medical utility. Understanding the wide array of actions individuals might take following genetic testing results could have important implications for clinical care. We aimed to survey the public regarding their perceptions of the importance of a wide variety of different actions one might take upon receiving hypothetical results from a WGS test where the results indicate a high risk of developing a genetic condition. We assessed whether demographic characteristics, type of condition, and perceived severity of the condition differentially affected importance ratings of actions they would take. In a survey administered at the 2015 Minnesota State Fair, 909 participants imagined that they had a blood test that looked at their genes and indicated that they were at high risk of developing one of three randomized conditions (Alzheimer's disease, macular degeneration, or colon cancer). Participants rated the importance of 35 actions. Principal component analysis, used to categorize actions, yielded eight categories: (1) medical management and communication; (2) partner support; (3) support and life fulfillment; (4) diet and exercise; (5) distal planning; (6) religion/spiritual support; (7) reproductive actions; and (8) proximal planning. Participants rated a wide range of actions as important, with medical management and communication, and partner support receiving the highest mean ratings. Linear regression yielded significant associations between importance ratings and demographics variables (age and gender), genetic condition, and perceived severity of the condition for different action categories. Genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals should consider a variety of possible patient actions beyond medical actionability when discussing genetic testing results. © 2019 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB A 55-yr-old woman presented with abdominal bloating for approximately 1 year. Imaging studies showed a cyst in the body of the pancreas with proximal pancreatic ductal dilation. An endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed. Cytologic findings from the cyst fluid were consistent with a mucinous neoplastic cyst, and the possibility of malignancy could not be entirely excluded. A KRAS mutation analysis was performed on the cyst fluid using the Idylla system and circulating tumor KRAS (ctKRAS) cartridge (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium), which tests for actionable mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of the KRAS gene. Idylla testing detected a KRAS G12D mutation in the cyst fluid. The patient subsequently underwent a distal subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Microscopic examination of the resected tissue revealed an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) with an associated invasive carcinoma. KRAS testing on the resected tumor tissue confirmed the G12D mutation detected in the cyst fluid earlier. The described rapid testing of KRAS directly from the pancreatic cyst fluid can complement cytology assessment to classify pancreatic cysts more reliably and can potentially be of significant help when other cyst findings are nondiagnostic. © 2019 Al-Turkmani et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Consumers are increasingly interested in the attributes of the food they consume. This includes what is in the food and how it was raised; and at least some consumers are willing to pay a premium for products with specific attributes. However, the current plethora of labels on the market does not adequately address this issue; rather than providing actionable information, most labels add to the consumer confusion. In addition, there is a tendency toward "absence labels" that can contribute to a negative consumer perception of conventional products that may or may not include the attribute in question. Communication with consumers about the complex and highly technical issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is challenging, and experiences from communication efforts about food safety-related issues demonstrate exactly how challenging this is to communicate clearly. General lessons learned from the science of risk communication can help guide efforts to communicate about the challenging issue of AMR. There are efforts underway to chart out a new approach. A new labeled animal production certification program is under development to provide choice for consumers, while reducing consumer confusion, which mandates antibiotic stewardship practices. © 2019 The Authors.

AB INTRODUCTION: Primary plasma cell leukemia (PPCL) is one of the most aggressive hematological malignancies. The prognosis of PPCL patients remains poor, although some improvements have been made in recent years. Areas covered: In this review recent clinical and biological advances in PPCL are reported. Some recommendations for the practical management of these patients are provided, with a particular focus on the role of novel agents and transplant procedures. A brief description of the currently ongoing clinical trials with new drugs is also enclosed. Expert opinion: PPCL still represents a difficult challenge for all hematologists. Here the authors provide a personal view on how the current, generally unsatisfactory results in this neoplastic disorder could be improved. In particular, dedicated studies exploring alternative therapies are necessary and eagerly awaited. Such studies should possibly be based on new biological information that could be of help in identifying novel genetic biomarkers for risk stratification and new actionable molecular targets.

AB BACKGROUND: Noninvasive genotyping using plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has the potential to obviate the need for some invasive biopsies in cancer patients while also elucidating disease heterogeneity. We sought to develop an ultra-deep plasma next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that could detect targetable oncogenic drivers and resistance mutations in patients where tissue biopsy failed to identify an actionable alteration.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma was prospectively collected from patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC. We carried out ultra-deep NGS using cfDNA extracted from plasma and matched white blood cells using a hybrid capture panel covering 37 lung cancer-related genes sequenced to 50000* raw target coverage filtering somatic mutations attributable to clonal hematopoiesis. Clinical sensitivity and specificity for plasma detection of known oncogenic drivers were calculated and compared with tissue genotyping results. Orthogonal ddPCR validation was carried out in a subset of cases.; RESULTS: In 127 assessable patients, plasma NGS detected driver mutations with variant allele fractions ranging from 0.14% to 52%. Plasma ddPCR for EGFR or KRAS mutations revealed findings nearly identical to those of plasma NGS in 21 of 22 patients, with high concordance of variant allele fraction (r=0.98). Blinded to tissue genotype, plasma NGS sensitivity for de novo plasma detection of known oncogenic drivers was 75% (68/91). Specificity of plasma NGS in those who were driver-negative by tissue NGS was 100% (19/19). In 17 patients with tumor tissue deemed insufficient for genotyping, plasma NGS identified four KRAS mutations. In 23 EGFR mutant cases with acquired resistance to targeted therapy, plasma NGS detected potential resistance mechanisms, including EGFR T790M and C797S mutations and ERBB2 amplification.; CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-deep plasma NGS with clonal hematopoiesis filtering resulted in de novo detection of targetable oncogenic drivers and resistance mechanisms in patients with NSCLC, including when tissue biopsy was inadequate for genotyping. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB The effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), a major strategy in the battle against HIV, depends on awareness of this modality and its proper timing among high-risk groups. While general awareness of PEP is improving, recently estimated to be 36-47% among men who have sex with men (MSM), PEP implementation remains disappointingly low and may be driven by limited awareness of effective PEP timing window. The level of detailed understanding of PEP timing and effectiveness among populations at risk has not been prospectively assessed to date. We prospectively evaluated, for the first time, actionable awareness regarding effective timing of PEP among a large cohort of individuals tested for HIV following unprotected sexual intercourse. Four hundred participants were assessed between December 2014 and February2016. Overall awareness of the option of PEP was 60% and was significantly higher among male members of the LGBTQ community (75·5% as compared to 52·6% among heterosexual males) and those undergoing past HIV testing (67·1%). However, only 24% of individuals at risk were aware as to the proper timing of effective PEP treatment, thereby leading, in the majority of cases, to missing the window of opportunity for PEP treatment. This study highlights the lack of knowledge as to the specific requirements needed for effective PEP timing. Expanded advertising, better targeting of the heterosexual population, training of family physicians in the field of gender, sexuality, and LGBTQ medicine, may improve effective PEP availability, thereby reducing HIV transmission.

AB Wilms tumour is the most common renal malignancy of childhood. The disease is curable in the majority of cases, albeit at considerable cost in terms of late treatment-related effects in some children. However, one in ten children with Wilms tumour will die of their disease despite modern treatment approaches. The genetic changes that underpin Wilms tumour have been defined by studies of familial cases and by unbiased DNA sequencing of tumour genomes. Together, these approaches have defined the landscape of cancer genes that are operative in Wilms tumour, many of which are intricately linked to the control of fetal nephrogenesis. Advances in our understanding of the germline and somatic genetic changes that underlie Wilms tumour may translate into better patient outcomes. Improvements in risk stratification have already been seen through the introduction of molecular biomarkers into clinical practice. A host of additional biomarkers are due to undergo clinical validation. Identifying actionable mutations has led to potential new targets, with some novel compounds undergoing testing in early phase trials. Avenues that warrant further exploration include targeting Wilms tumour cancer genes with a non-redundant role in nephrogenesis and targeting the fetal renal transcriptome.

AB BACKGROUND: This multicenter, retrospective study explored the value of oncogene driver subtype, programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) status, and smoking status for predicting which patients with oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) would benefit from treatment with programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 inhibitors.; METHODS: The clinical features, PD-L1 tumor proportion scores, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (PDi) outcomes (objective response rate and progression-free survival) of patients who had advanced NSCLC with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations or common, actionable oncogenic drivers were captured.; RESULTS: In total, 189 oncogene-positive patients were analyzed. Of these, 104 received a PDi, and 108 had undergone prior PD-L1 testing. The frequency of PD-L1 positivity (≥1%) was higher in patients who had KRAS mutations (P=.031), smokers (P=.006), and non-Asian patients (P=.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that smoking status (P < .001) was the only factor associated significantly with KRAS mutation. The objective response rate to PDi treatment was 16.9% (11 of 65 patients) among smokers (17.3% in the KRAS-mutant and 15.4% in the non-KRAS-mutant smoker subgroups), which was significantly higher than the 0% rate (0 of 26 patients; P=.019) among never-smokers. In subgroup analyses, progression-free survival was influenced by KRAS mutation status (median, 4.57 vs 1.63 months; P=.004), smoking status (4.07 vs 1.73 months; P=.004), PD-L1 positivity (3.8 vs 1.2 months; P=.040), and non-Asian race (3.0 vs 1.97 months; P=.046). In multivariable analysis, only smoking status (P=.008) remained a significant predictor when a PD-L1 level ≥1% was used. However, both smoking status (P=.001) and PD-L1 status (P=.028) were independent predictors when a PD-L1 level ≥50% was used.; CONCLUSIONS: Among associated clinical features among patients who have NSCLC with oncogenic drivers, smoking status potentially was the most important, easily available predictor of single PDi efficacy. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

AB By serving as intermediaries between cellular metabolism and the bioenergetic demands of proliferation, endolysosomes allow cancer cells to thrive under normally detrimental conditions. Here, we show that an endolysosomal TRP channel, TRPML1, is necessary for the proliferation of cancer cells that bear activating mutations in HRAS Expression of MCOLN1, which encodes TRPML1, is significantly elevated in HRAS-positive tumors and inversely correlated with patient prognosis. Concordantly, MCOLN1 knockdown or TRPML1 inhibition selectively reduces the proliferation of cancer cells that express oncogenic, but not wild-type, HRAS Mechanistically, TRPML1 maintains oncogenic HRAS in signaling-competent nanoclusters at the plasma membrane by mediating cholesterol de-esterification and transport. TRPML1 inhibition disrupts the distribution and levels of cholesterol and thereby attenuates HRAS nanoclustering and plasma membrane abundance, ERK phosphorylation, and cell proliferation. These findings reveal a selective vulnerability of HRAS-driven cancers to TRPML1 inhibition, which may be leveraged as an actionable therapeutic strategy. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Existing approaches to managing genetic and genomic test results from external laboratories typically include filing of text reports within the electronic health record, making them unavailable in many cases for clinical decision support. Even when structured computable results are available, the lack of adopted standards requires considerations for processing the results into actionable knowledge, in addition to storage and management of the data. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an ancillary genomics system used to receive and process heterogeneous results from external laboratories, which returns a descriptive phenotype to the electronic health record in support of pharmacogenetic clinical decision support. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Non-valvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism anticoagulation risk assessment tools have been increasingly utilized to guide implementation and duration of anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke and recurrent venous thromboembolism risk, but comes at the cost of increased risk of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. The decision for anticoagulation in high-risk patients is complicated by the fact that many risk factors associated with increased thromboembolic risk are simultaneously associated with increased bleeding risk. Traditional risk assessment tools rely heavily on age, sex, and presence of cardiovascular comorbidities, with newer tools additionally taking into account changes in risk factors over time and novel biomarkers to facilitate more personalized risk assessment. These tools may help counsel and inform patients about the risks and benefits of starting or continuing anticoagulant therapy and can identify patients who may benefit from more careful management. Although the ability to predict anticoagulant-associated hemorrhagic risk is modest, ischemic and bleeding risk scores have been shown to add significant value to therapeutic management decisions. Ultimately, further work is needed to optimally implement accurate and actionable risk stratification into clinical practice.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the most common type of cancer in Japan, and its prognosis has improved because of development of diagnosis and advancement in treatments including surgery and chemotherapy. However, because of intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution, tumors often develop resistance to treatment. Genotyping tumor tissue in search of somatic genetic alterations for actionable information has become routine examination in clinical practice. However, the inherent molecular heterogeneity of metastatic tumors and the ability of cancer genomes to dynamically evolve are not properly captured by tissue specimens only. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carrying tumor-specific genetic or epigenetic alterations is released into the circulation from tumor cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis. Analysis of ctDNA has the potential to change clinical practice by exploiting blood rather than tissue, as a source of information. Here, we provide an overview of the characteristics of ctDNA and focus on detection methods for ctDNA, and the feasibility of use of ctDNA to monitor tumor dynamics for patients with colorectal cancer. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue (ie, clinical sequencing) can guide clinical management by providing information about actionable gene aberrations that have diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Here, we undertook a hospital-based prospective study (TOP-GEAR project, 2nd stage) to investigate the feasibility and utility of NGS-based analysis of 114 cancer-associated genes (the NCC Oncopanel test). We examined 230 cases (comprising more than 30 tumor types) of advanced solid tumors, all of which were matched with nontumor samples. Gene profiling data were obtained for 187 cases (81.3%), 111 (59.4%) of which harbored actionable gene aberrations according to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Next Generation Sequencing in Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment (Edition 1.0) issued by 3 major Japanese cancer-related societies. Twenty-five (13.3%) cases have since received molecular-targeted therapy according to their gene aberrations. These results indicate the utility of tumor-profiling multiplex gene panel testing in a clinical setting in Japan.

AB Polypharmacy has been linked to adverse outcomes including increased risk of hospitalization, falls, and death and contributes to unnecessary healthcare spending. Deprescribing efforts aim to reduce medication burden while improving or maintaining patients' quality of life. While the practice of deprescribing is gaining momentum, quality measurement and provider reimbursement are barriers that must be addressed for deprescribing to achieve widespread adoption. Because many quality measures are focused on medication use and adherence, deprescribing efforts may negatively impact primary care provider and health plan quality ratings and value-based reimbursement. In addressing this conflict, there are opportunities to proactively align the priorities and incentives of patients, providers, and plans to promote deprescribing. In this report, we propose several actionable steps to address quality and reimbursement-based barriers such as facilitating the exclusion of those engaged in deprescribing efforts from quality measures and the development of deprescribing-based quality measures.

AB OBJECTIVE: Family planning (FP) clinics are an ideal setting to disseminate information about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but little is known about women's preferences for learning about PrEP in this setting.; STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed 500 women seeking care at 4 FP clinics in Atlanta. Before their provider visit, participants completed an HIV-risk screener. After, we asked participants about the HIV prevention counseling they received and how clinics could share information about PrEP. We performed descriptive analyses on demographics, HIV risk, and PrEP awareness/interest, and conducted thematic analysis on open-ended responses.; RESULTS: Only 18% knew about PrEP before the study; 28% of 376 sexually-active women had≥1 risk indicator consistent with PrEP eligibility. Three hundred forty seven women (69%) shared suggestions about how clinics should share PrEP information. We categorized suggestions into 4 themes - Advertising, Conversations, Awareness and Access. Participants (n=150) suggested clinics should advertise PrEP via brochures, posters, texts, or emails; 134 wanted providers to talk to patients about PrEP. Several (n=71) suggested sharing PrEP information broadly in the community and with other clinics/providers; others (n=11) wanted improved access to PrEP services.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate overwhelming patient interest in learning more about PrEP through educational materials and directly from FP providers. Women were vocal about increasing PrEP awareness in the community, particularly among populations especially at risk for HIV (e.g., teens). These suggestions can be translated into actionable steps FP clinics can take to increase PrEP awareness and expand their reach to benefit women at risk for HIV.; IMPLICATIONS: High HIV rates among women in the South make it imperative to increase awareness of PrEP among women. Atlanta women seeking care in FP clinics valued learning about PrEP and recommended feasible strategies for disseminating information about PrEP in community settings, the clinic or during patient-provider discussion.

AB Next-generation sequencing has provided information on actionable targets and biomarkers of response in oncology. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Wnt/CTNNB1 mutations characterize the immune-excluded class (cold tumors) and might represent the biomarkers predicting resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Large-scale validation of these data is needed to customize immunotherapy in advanced HCC.See related article by Harding et al., p. 2116. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Many of the policies shown to benefit the public's health in research studies are never widely implemented. We conducted a qualitative and exploratory multiple-case study of three U.S. academic research-policy translation initiatives that resulted in the development, enactment and/or implementation of evidence-based policies to address public health issues: gun policy (Case 1); opioid policy (Case 2) and drug control policy (Case 3). We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 25 key stakeholders involved in the three cases and analysed transcripts using a hybrid a priori and data-driven approach. Across cases, participants identified four key processes that should be included in research-policy translation initiatives: stakeholder engagement, consensus-building, long-term coalition engagement and use of effective knowledge brokers. Participants perceived differences in how the structure of and activities within each initiative facilitated these processes. For example, participants perceived the gun policy initiative, which included large-scale policy dissemination strategies such as state forums where research experts interacted with state policymakers and advocates, as more effective at long-term coalition engagement than the other two initiatives. Study results suggest concrete and actionable academic research-policy strategies that have the potential for widespread adoption by universities or other organizations. i The Author(s) 2019.

AB PROBLEM: Thirteen measurable Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) have been proposed by the Association of American Medical Colleges as a means to operationalize medical school graduates' patient care qualifications. Mastery learning is an effective method for boosting clinical skills, but its applicability to the EPAs remains to be studied. The authors designed this study to evaluate a mastery learning intervention to teach and assess components of 3 of the 13 EPAs in a 4th-year capstone course.; INTERVENTION: The course featured mastery learning principles and addressed three EPA-based skills: (a) obtain informed consent, (b) develop a differential diagnosis and write admission orders, and (c) write discharge prescriptions. All students underwent a baseline skills assessment, received feedback, engaged in deliberate practice with actionable feedback, and completed a similar skills-based posttest assessment. Students continued with practice and testing until the minimum passing standards (MPSs) were reached for each posttest.; CONTEXT: All medical students at a single medical school (Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine) who matriculated in 2012 and graduated with the class of 2016 participated in a required transition to residency course immediately prior to graduation.; OUTCOME: There were 134 students eligible to participate, and 130 (97.0%) completed all curricular requirements and assessments. All 130 medical students who completed the course met or exceeded the MPS for each of the three EPA-based clinical skills. Reliability coefficients for outcome data were uniformly high. Measures for each of the three clinical skills showed statistically significant improvement.; LESSONS LEARNED: The capstone course was an effective approach to teach and assess components of three EPA-based clinical skills to mastery learning standards in a 4th-year capstone course. We learned that this approach for implementation is feasible and results in significant improvement in components of EPA skill performance. Next steps will include developing assessments incorporating the mastery model into components of additional EPAs, identifying the best location within the curriculum to insert this content, and expanding the number of assessments as part of a larger assessment system.

AB PURPOSE: Prior molecular profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has identified actionable findings that may have a role in guiding therapeutic decision-making and clinical trial enrollment. We implemented prospective next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the clinic to determine whether such analyses provide predictive and/or prognostic information for HCC patients treated with contemporary systemic therapies.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Matched tumor/normal DNA from patients with HCC (N = 127) were analyzed using a hybridization capture-based NGS assay designed to target 341 or more cancer-associated genes. Demographic and treatment data were prospectively collected with the goal of correlating treatment outcomes and drug response with molecular profiles.; RESULTS: WNT/beta-catenin pathway (45%) and TP53 (33%) alterations were frequent and represented mutually exclusive molecular subsets. In sorafenib-treated patients (n = 81), oncogenic PI3K-mTOR pathway alterations were associated with lower disease control rates (DCR, 8.3% vs. 40.2%), shorter median progression-free survival (PFS; 1.9 vs. 5.3 months), and shorter median overall survival (OS; 10.4 vs. 17.9 months). For patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 31), activating alteration WNT/beta-catenin signaling were associated with lower DCR (0% vs. 53%), shorter median PFS (2.0 vs. 7.4 months), and shorter median OS (9.1 vs. 15.2 months). Twenty-four percent of patients harbored potentially actionable alterations including TSC1/2 (8.5%) inactivating/truncating mutations, FGF19 (6.3%) and MET (1.5%) amplifications, and IDH1 missense mutations (<1%). Six percent of patients treated with systemic therapy were matched to targeted therapeutics.; CONCLUSIONS: Linking NGS to routine clinical care has the potential to identify those patients with HCC likely to benefit from standard systemic therapies and can be used in an investigational context to match patients to genome-directed targeted therapies.See related commentary by Pinyol et al., p. 2021. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB OBJECTIVES: It is commonplace to consider accelerometer load and any resultant neuromuscular fatigue in training programs. With these data becoming accepted in sport alongside wellness questionnaires this study aimed to investigate if a deeper analysis of the accelerometry data can provide actionable insight into training-induced disruptions.; DESIGN: Accelerometer data from Collegiate American Football athletes (n=63) were collected during training and matches across a regular season.; METHODS: These data were processed to: identify instances of high speed running, extract step waveforms from those sections, and determine the variability of those waveforms via a within- and between-section co-efficient of multiple determination. Athletes completed wellness questionnaires prior to sessions that were used to flag areas of muscle soreness as well as fatigue, or disturbed sleep quality. Linear mixed models were used to assess associations between inter stride variability and flags in wellness/soreness markers.; RESULTS: An increase in acute (7d) load saw an increased stride variability in these athletes. Feeling less fatigued and/or lower muscle soreness was associated with higher stride variability.; CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of variability has the potential to identify athletes who are displaying physical symptoms that would indicate the need to modify training.

AB Understanding the genetic causes of neurodegenerative disease (ND) can be useful for their prevention and treatment. Among the genetic variations responsible for ND, heritable germline variants have been discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and nonheritable somatic mutations have been discovered in sequencing projects. Distinguishing the important initiating genes in ND and comparing the importance of heritable and nonheritable genetic variants fortreating ND are important challenges. In this study, we analysed GWAS results, somatic mutations and drug targets of ND from large databanks by performing directed network-based analysis considering a randomised network hypothesis testing procedure. A disease-associated biological network was created in the context of the functional interactome, and the nonrandom topological characteristics of directed-edge classes were interpreted. Hierarchical network analysis indicated that drug targets tend to lie upstream of somatic mutations and germline variants. Furthermore, using directed path length information and biological explanations, we provide information on the most important genes in these created node classes and their associated drugs. Finally, we identified nine germline variants overlapping with drug targets for ND, seven somatic mutations close to drug targets from the hierarchical network analysis and six crucial genes in controlling other genes from the network analysis. Based on these findings, some drugs have been proposed for treating ND via drug repurposing. Our results provide new insights into the therapeutic actionability of GWAS results and somatic mutations for ND. The interesting properties of each node class and the existing relationships between them can broaden our knowledge of ND. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB AIMS: (a) Assess nurses' readiness to learn (RTL) before receiving education on the re-engineered discharge (RED) programme and (b) measure utilization of the RED discharge process from patient chart reviews following an educational intervention.; BACKGROUND: Preventable readmissions are of great concern. Rural areas are at a disadvantage, due to decreased access to health care and other disparities.; METHODS: Sixty-nine participants completed the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale prior to the RED education intervention. Thirty-minute education interventions were provided addressing various learning preferences.; RESULTS: Participants scored high M=219.8 (SD 23.7) on the SDLR, indicating nurses' high RTL prior to educational intervention. Chart reviews found usage of the RED 12 actionable item pre-intervention, (n=60) M=6.55 (SD 1.478) compared to post-intervention (n=60) M=10.08 (SD 1.544) indicated statistically significant improvement in pre-discharge patient education and planning (t=17.730, p=0.000 [CI 3.13-3.93]).; CONCLUSION: Current study found that nurses with higher levels of RTL who underwent RED educational sessions significantly improved delivery of the RED process documented in the medical record.; IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Those responsible for education initiatives must make understanding nurses' learning preferences a priority to improve the quality of bedside practice. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Judicious use of real-world data (RWD) is expected to make all steps in the development and use of pharmaceuticals more effective and efficient, including research and development, regulatory decision making, health technology assessment, pricing, and reimbursement decisions and treatment. A "learning healthcare system" based on electronic health records and other routinely collected data will be required to harness the full potential of RWD to complement evidence based on randomized controlled trials. We describe and illustrate with examples the growing demand for a learning healthcare system; we contrast the exigencies of an efficient pharmaceutical ecosystem in the future with current deficiencies highlighted in recently published Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports; and we reflect on the steps necessary to enable the transition from healthcare data to actionable information. A coordinated effort from all stakeholders and international cooperation will be required to increase the speed of implementation of the learning healthcare system, to everybody's benefit. © 2018 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence translation and improvement research indicate that healthcare contexts are complex systems, characterized by uncertainty and surprise, which often defy orchestrated intervention attempts. This article reflects on the implications of complexity on attempts to translate evidence, and on a newly published framework for Successful Healthcare Improvements From Translating Evidence in complex systems (SHIFT-Evidence).; DISCUSSION: SHIFT-Evidence positions the challenge of evidence translation within the complex and evolving context of healthcare, and recognizes the wider issues practitioners routinely face. It is empirically grounded, and designed to be comprehensive, practically relevant and actionable. SHIFT-evidence is summarized by three principles designed to be intuitive and memorable: 'act scientifically and pragmatically'; 'embrace complexity'; and 'engage and empower'. Common challenges and strategies to overcome them are summarized in 12 'simple rules' that provide actionable guidance.; CONCLUSION: SHIFT-Evidence provides a practical tool to guide practice and research of evidence translation and improvement within complex dynamic healthcare settings. Implications are that improvement initiatives and research study designs need to take into account the unique initial conditions in each local setting; conduct needs to respond to unpredictable effects and address dependent problems; and evaluation needs to be sensitive to evolving priorities and the emergent range of activities required to achieve improvement. © The Author 2018.

AB BACKGROUND: Breast cancer brain metastases (BrMs) are defined by complex adaptations to both adjuvant treatment regimens and the brain microenvironment. Consequences of these alterations remain poorly understood, as does their potential for clinical targeting. We utilized genome-wide molecular profiling to identify therapeutic targets acquired in metastatic disease.; METHODS: Gene expression profiling of 21 patient-matched primary breast tumors and their associated brain metastases was performed by TrueSeq RNA-sequencing to determine clinically actionable BrM target genes. Identified targets were functionally validated using small molecule inhibitors in a cohort of resected BrM ex vivo explants (n = 4) and in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of BrM. All statistical tests were two-sided.; RESULTS: Considerable shifts in breast cancer cell-specific gene expression profiles were observed (1314 genes upregulated in BrM; 1702 genes downregulated in BrM; DESeq; fold change > 1.5, Padj < .05). Subsequent bioinformatic analysis for readily druggable targets revealed recurrent gains in RET expression and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling. Small molecule inhibition of RET and HER2 in ex vivo patient BrM models (n = 4) resulted in statistically significantly reduced proliferation (P < .001 in four of four models). Furthermore, RET and HER2 inhibition in a PDX model of BrM led to a statistically significant antitumor response vs control (n = 4, % tumor growth inhibition [mean difference; SD], anti-RET = 86.3% [1176; 258.3], P < .001; anti-HER2 = 91.2% [1114; 257.9], P < .01).; CONCLUSIONS: RNA-seq profiling of longitudinally collected specimens uncovered recurrent gene expression acquisitions in metastatic tumors, distinct from matched primary tumors. Critically, we identify aberrations in key oncogenic pathways and provide functional evidence for their suitability as therapeutic targets. Altogether, this study establishes recurrent, acquired vulnerabilities in BrM that warrant immediate clinical investigation and suggests paired specimen expression profiling as a compelling and underutilized strategy to identify targetable dependencies in advanced cancers. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient-reported assessments of the clinic experience are increasingly important for improving the delivery of care. The Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG-CAHPS) survey is the current standard for evaluating patients' clinic experience, but its format gives 2-mo delayed feedback on a small proportion of patients in clinic. Furthermore, it fails to give specific actionable results on individual encounters.; OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess the impact of a single-page Clinic Satisfaction Tool (CST) to demonstrate real-time feedback, individualized responses, interpretable and actionable feedback, improved patient satisfaction and communication scores, increased physician buy-in, and overall feasibility.; METHODS: We assessed CST use for 12 mo and compared patient-reported outcomes to the year prior. We assessed all clinic encounters for patient satisfaction, all physicians for CG-CAHPS global rating, and physician communication scores, and evaluated the physician experience 1 yr after implementation.; RESULTS: During implementation, 14 690 patients were seen by 12 physicians, with a 96% overall CST utilization rate. Physicians considered the CST superior to CG-CAHPS in providing immediate feedback. CG-CAHPS global scores trended toward improvement and were predicted by CST satisfaction scores (P<.05). CG-CAHPS physician communication scores were also predicted by CST satisfaction scores (P<.01). High CST satisfaction scores were predicted by high utilization (P<.05). Negative feedback dropped significantly over the course of the study (P<.05).; CONCLUSION: The CST is a low-cost, high-yield improvement to the current method of capturing the clinic experience, improves communication and satisfaction between physicians and patients, and provides real-time feedback to physicians.

AB Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor with bad prognosis. On the other hand, oncolytic measles virus (MeV) therapy is an experimental glioma treatment strategy with clinical safety and first evidence of anti-tumoral efficacy. Therefore, we investigated the combination of MeV with conventional therapies by cytotoxic survival assays in long-term glioma cell lines LN229, LNZ308, and glioma stem-like GS8 cells, as well as the basal viral infectivity in primary glioblastoma cultures T81/16, T1094/17, and T708/16. We employed Chou-Talalay analysis to identify the synergistic treatment sequence chemotherapy, virotherapy, and finally radiotherapy (CT-VT-RT). RNA sequencing and immunopeptidome analyses were used to delineate treatment-induced molecular and immunological profiles. CT-VT-RT displayed synergistic anti-glioma activity and initiated a type 1 interferon response, along with canonical Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling, and downstream interferon-stimulated genes were induced, resulting in apoptotic cascades. Furthermore, antigen presentation along with immunostimulatory chemokines was increased in CT-VT-RT-treated glioma cells, indicating a treatment-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype. We identified novel treatment-induced viral and tumor-associated peptides through HLA ligandome analysis. Our data delineate an actionable treatment-induced molecular and immunological signature of CT-VT-RT, and they could be exploited for the design of novel tailored treatment strategies involving virotherapy and immunotherapy.

AB The concept of ASEAN Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance (AVSSR) has recently been advocated for by the National Vaccine Institute (NVI), a public organization of Thailand, through two workshops in 2014 and 2015 organized in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) for the ASEAN Collaboration Initiatives for Regional Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance (VSSR). In both workshops relevant policy makers, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) managers, and experts from government and partner agencies involved in the vaccine life cycle actively participated. A paradigm shift in leveraging the initiatives of VSSR from national to regional levels was noted and reiterated. The first workshop's objective was to understand the perspectives and identify the needs of ASEAN countries regarding vaccine security, and to list potential areas for further collaboration. The existing vaccine-related capacities, collaborations, and networks in ASEAN were discussed based on findings from a pre-workshop, self-administered questionnaire survey. The workshop ended with four key areas unanimously recommended for regional collaboration strengthening: (1) system development for vaccine security; (2) human resource development; (3) ASEAN price policy for vaccine (APPV) and pooled procurement; and (4) communication and coordination. A call for immediate action was made, prompting the second workshop to focus only on "communication and coordination" to identify concrete, actionable collaborative models for effective communication and coordination. At the second workshop, a five-year Communication and Coordination Action Plan (CCAP) was developed to foster long-term AVSSR. The AVSSR's ultimate goal is to avoid incidental vaccine shortage and ensure sufficient supply of affordable, quality vaccines for normal and urgent situations both at the national and ASEAN-wide levels. To date, collaboration for AVSSR is being strengthened according to the ASEAN post-2015 Health Development Agenda and its collaborative framework among concerned countries and development partners. Nevertheless, to achieve the goal, integration of multiple strategies based upon strong policy commitment and uninterrupted engagement among relevant partners are required.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genomic studies of localized and metastatic prostate cancer have identified a high prevalence of clinically actionable alterations including mutations in DNA repair genes. In this manuscript, we review the current knowledge on DNA repair defects in prostate cancer and provide an overview of how these alterations can be targeted towards a personalized prostate cancer management.; RECENT FINDINGS: Twenty to 25% of metastatic prostate cancers harbor defects in DNA repair genes, most commonly in the homologous recombination genes. These defects confer increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Recent trials also support a synergistic effect of combining these therapies with androgen receptor-targeting agents. Identification of mismatch-repair defects could result in defining a prostate cancer population who may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. These data have implications for family testing and early diagnosis, as many of these mutations are linked to inherited risk of prostate cancer. The DNA damage repair pathways are clinically relevant in prostate cancer, being a target for precision medicine; combination with standard-of-care androgen receptor (AR)-targeting agents may be synergistic.

AB In humans, many cases of congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) are caused by mutations of components of the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway, which is required for survival and specification of nociceptors and plays a major role in pain processing. Mutations in PRDM12 have been identified in CIP patients that indicate a putative role for this transcriptional regulator in pain sensing. Here, we show that Prdm12 expression is restricted to developing and adult nociceptors and that its genetic ablation compromises their viability and maturation. Mechanistically, we find that Prdm12 is required for the initiation and maintenance of the expression of TrkA by acting asa modulator of Neurogenin1/2 transcription factor activity, in frogs, mice, and humans. Altogether, ourresults identify Prdm12 as an evolutionarily conserved key regulator of nociceptor specification and as an actionable target for new pain therapeutics. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB TFEB and TFE3 are transcriptional regulators of the innate immune response, but the mechanisms regulating their activation upon pathogen infection are poorly elucidated. Using C.elegans and mammalian models, we report that the master metabolic modulator 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its negative regulator Folliculin (FLCN) act upstream of TFEB/TFE3 in the innate immune response, independently of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. In nematodes, loss of FLCN or overexpression of AMPK confers pathogen resistance via activation ofTFEB/TFE3-dependent antimicrobial genes, whereas ablation of total AMPK activity abolishes this phenotype. Similarly, in mammalian cells, loss of FLCN or pharmacological activation of AMPK induces TFEB/TFE3-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Importantly, a rapid reduction in cellular ATP levels in murine macrophages is observed upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment accompanied by an acute AMPK activation and TFEB nuclear localization. These results uncover an ancient, highly conserved, and pharmacologically actionable mechanism coupling energy status with innate immunity. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Metastasis-initiating cells dynamically adapt to the distinct microenvironments of different organs, but these early adaptations are poorly understood due to the limited sensitivity of in situ transcriptomics. We developed fluorouracil-labeled RNA sequencing (Flura-seq) for in situ analysis with high sensitivity. Flura-seq utilizes cytosine deaminase (CD) to convert fluorocytosine to fluorouracil, metabolically labeling nascent RNA in rare cell populations in situ for purification and sequencing. Flura-seq revealed hundreds of unique, dynamic organ-specific gene signatures depending on the microenvironment in mouse xenograft breast cancer micrometastases. Specifically, the mitochondrial electron transport Complex I, oxidative stress and counteracting antioxidant programs were induced in pulmonary micrometastases, compared to mammary tumors or brain micrometastases. We confirmed lung metastasis-specific increase in oxidative stress and upregulation of antioxidants in clinical samples, thus validating Flura-seq's utility in identifying clinically actionable microenvironmental adaptations in early metastasis. The sensitivity, robustness and economy of Flura-seq are broadly applicable beyond cancer research. © 2019, Basnet et al.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical sequencing data should be shared in order to achieve the sufficient scale and diversity required to provide strong evidence for improving patient care. A distributed research network allows researchers to share this evidence rather than the patient-level data across centers, thereby avoiding privacy issues. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) used in distributed research networks has low coverage of sequencing data and does not reflect the latest trends of precision medicine.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a genomic CDM (G-CDM), as an extension of the OMOP-CDM, for application of genomic data in clinical practice.; METHODS: Existing genomic data models and sequencing reports were reviewed to extend the OMOP-CDM to cover genomic data. The Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee and Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature were adopted to standardize the terminology in the model. Sequencing data of 114 and 1060 patients with lung cancer were obtained from the Ajou University School of Medicine database of Ajou University Hospital and The Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively, which were transformed to a format appropriate for the G-CDM. The data were compared with respect to gene name, variant type, and actionable mutations.; RESULTS: The G-CDM was extended into four tables linked to tables of the OMOP-CDM. Upon comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas data, a clinically actionable mutation, p.Leu858Arg, in the EGFR gene was 6.64 times more frequent in the Ajou University School of Medicine database, while the p.Gly12Xaa mutation in the KRAS gene was 2.02 times more frequent in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. The data-exploring tool GeneProfiler was further developed to conduct descriptive analyses automatically using the G-CDM, which provides the proportions of genes, variant types, and actionable mutations. GeneProfiler also allows for querying the specific gene name and Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature to calculate the proportion of patients with a given mutation.; CONCLUSIONS: We developed the G-CDM for effective integration of genomic data with standardized clinical data, allowing for data sharing across institutes. The feasibility of the G-CDM was validated by assessing the differences in data characteristics between two different genomic databases through the proposed data-exploring tool GeneProfiler. The G-CDM may facilitate analyses of interoperating clinical and genomic datasets across multiple institutions, minimizing privacy issues and enabling researchers to better understand the characteristics of patients and promote personalized medicine in clinical practice. ©Seo Jeong Shin, Seng Chan You, Yu Rang Park, Jin Roh, Jang-Hee Kim, Seokjin Haam, Christian G Reich, Clair Blacketer, Dae-Soon Son, Seungbin Oh, Rae Woong Park.

AB BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common human malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Over the past few decades, genomic alterations of cancer driver genes have been identified in NSCLC, and molecular testing and targeted therapies have become standard care for lung cancer patients. Here we studied the unique genomic profile of driver genes in Chinese patients with NSCLC by next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. The median age was 60years (range: 26-89), and 83% cases were adenocarcinoma. NGS-based genomic profiling of major lung cancer-related genes was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples and matched blood.; RESULTS: Approximately 73.9% of patients with NSCLC harbored at least one actionable alteration recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ALK, ERBB2, MET, BRAF, RET, and ROS1. Twenty-seven patients (2.2%) harbored inherited germline mutations of cancer susceptibility genes. The frequencies of EGFR genomic alterations (both mutations and amplification) and ALK rearrangement were identified as 50.1% and 7.8% in Chinese NSCLC populations, respectively, and significantly higher than the Western population. Fifty-six distinct uncommon EGFR mutations other than L858R, exon19del, exon20ins, or T790M were identified in 18.9% of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. About 7.4% of patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations, and 11.6% of patients harbored only uncommon EGFR mutations. The uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK, CDKN2A, NTRK3, TSC2, and KRAS. In patients <40years of age, the ALK-positive percentage was up to 28.2%. Moreover, 3.2% of ALK-positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangements, and seven new partner genes were identified.; CONCLUSION: More unique features of cancer driver genes in Chinese NSCLC were identified by next-generation sequencing. These findings highlighted that NGS technology is more feasible and necessary than other molecular testing methods, and suggested that the special strategies are needed for drug development and targeted therapy for Chinese patients with NSCLC.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Molecular targeted therapy is now the standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Samples of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were analyzed through next-generation sequencing to characterize the unique feature of uncommon EGFR mutations and ALK fusion. The results showed that 7.4% of EGFR-mutant patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations and 11.6% harbored only uncommon mutations. Uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK, CDKN2A, NTRK3, TSC2, and KRAS. ALK fusion was more common in younger patients, and the frequency decreased monotonically with age. 3.2% of ALK-positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangement, and seven new partner genes were identified. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB PURPOSE: The prevalence of pharmacogenetically actionable medications in advanced cancer patients whose therapy may be optimized with genotype data was determined.; METHODS: Patients enrolled in our institutional molecular tumor board observational cohort were included in this study. Collected data included demographics, type(s) of cancer, and outpatient medications. Medications were classified as "pharmacogenetically actionable" if there are Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) therapeutic recommendations for that medication based on the presence of germline variations. The prevalence of pharmacogenetically actionable medications in the study population was determined, and the frequency of opportunities for pharmacogenetic prescribing and adverse event (AE) mitigation were estimated.; RESULTS: In a cohort of 193 patients with advanced cancer, 65% of patients were taking a pharmacogenetically actionable medication. Approximately 10% of the outpatient medications taken by the study population had a pharmacogenetic association. The most common pharmacogenetically actionable medications being used were ondansetron (47%), capecitabine (10%), and sertraline (7%). Using published genetic variation frequencies and AE risk, we conservatively estimated that 7.1% of cancer patients would be eligible for genetic-based medication adjustment, and 101 AEs would be prevented in 10,000 patients genotyped.; CONCLUSION: Medications with pharmacogenetic associations are used commonly in the advanced cancer patient population. This widespread exposure supports the implementation of prospective genotyping in the treatment of these high-risk patients. © American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVES: In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), tumour biopsy can often be an invasive procedure. The development of a non-invasive methodology to study genetic changes via circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is an appealing concept. Whilst CTCs typically remain as rare cells, improvements in epitope-independent CTC isolation techniques has given rise to a greater capture of CTCs. In this cross sectional study, we demonstrate the capture and characterization of NSCLC CTCs for the clinically actionable markers epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. The study identified CTCs/CTC clusters in 26/35 Stage IV NSCLC patients, and subsequently characterized the CTCs for EGFR mutation, ALK status and PD-L1 status. This pilot study demonstrates the potential of a non-invasive fluid biopsy to determine clinically relevant biomarkers in NSCLC.

AB INTRODUCTION: Tumor mutation profiling is standard-of-care in lung carcinoma patients. However, comprehensive molecular profiling of small specimens, including core needle biopsy (CNB) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens, may often be inadequate due to limited tissue. Centrifuged FNA supernatants, which are typically discarded, have emerged recently as a novel liquid-based biopsy for molecular testing. In this study, we evaluate the use of lung carcinoma FNA supernatants for detecting clinically relevant mutations.; METHODS: Supernatants from lung carcinoma FNA samples (n=150) were evaluated. Samples were further analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and ultrasensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Mutation profiles in a subset of samples were compared to results derived from paired tissue samples from the same patient (n=67) and available plasma liquid biopsy assay (n=45).; RESULTS: All 150 samples yielded adequate DNA and NGS was performed successfully on 104 (90%) of 116 selected samples. Somatic mutations were detected in 82% of the samples and in 50% of these patients a clinically relevant mutation was identified that would qualify them for targeted therapy or a clinical trial. There was high overall concordance between the mutation profiles of supernatants and the corresponding tissue samples, with 100% concordance with concurrent FNA and 96% with concurrent CNB samples. Comparison of actionable driver mutations detected in supernatant versus plasma samples showed 84% concordance.; CONCLUSIONS: FNA supernatants can provide a valuable specimen source for genotyping lung carcinoma especially in patients with insufficient tumor tissue, thereby reducing multigene mutation profiling failure rates, improving turnaround times, and avoiding repeat biopsies. © The Author 2019.

AB Increasingly effective therapies targeting the androgen receptor have paradoxically promoted the incidence of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), the most lethal subtype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa), for which there is no effective therapy. Here we report that protein kinase C (PKC)lambda/iota is downregulated in de novo and during therapy-induced NEPC, which results in the upregulation of serine biosynthesis through an mTORC1/ATF4-driven pathway. This metabolic reprogramming supports cell proliferation and increases intracellular S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) levels to feed epigenetic changes that favor the development of NEPC characteristics. Altogether, we have uncovered a metabolic vulnerability triggered by PKClambda/iota deficiency in NEPC, which offers potentially actionable targets to prevent therapy resistance in PCa.

AB Ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy are standard-of-care treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) patients and both result in DNA damage, however, the clinical efficacy is limited due to therapeutic resistance. We identified a mechanism of such resistance mediated by phosphorylation of PTEN on tyrosine 240 (pY240-PTEN) by FGFR2. pY240-PTEN is rapidly elevated and bound to chromatin through interaction with Ki-67 in response to IR treatment and facilitates the recruitment of RAD51 to promote DNA repair. Blocking Y240 phosphorylation confers radiation sensitivity to tumors and extends survival in GBM preclinical models. Y240F-Pten knockin mice showed radiation sensitivity. These results suggest that FGFR-mediated pY240-PTEN is a key mechanism of radiation resistance and is an actionable target for improving radiotherapy efficacy. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In the current pharmaceutical regulatory environment, patients continue to benefit from great advances in medical care. Sophisticated regulatory review systems have also evolved to ensure that safe and effective medicines are approved. However, these systems are not optimized in all countries. Gaps in individual regulatory agency capabilities together with duplication in non-value added national regulatory requirements, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), can slow down regulatory approvals and therefore impede patient access to new medicines. These gaps exist despite the achievements in both regulatory convergence and harmonization of technical requirements by bodies such as the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). There is a pressing need to strengthen regulatory review systems in emerging market economies as highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO). These diverse challenges may seem overwhelming to individual national regulators, in part because of the sheer number of initiatives by multiple stakeholders, combined with a lack of information on concise practical actionable measures that can have a positive impact on review efficiency. This commentary presents 10 pillars that we believe represent the key hallmarks of strong regulatory review systems. Leveraging our internal company expertise at the global, regional, and country level across our entire product portfolio (both innovative and generic), we selected features proven to work in leading regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which are also relevant for other regulatory authorities, especially in LMICs.

AB While many molecular alterations in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor, have been defined, the intricate signaling networks associated with these alterations that represent actionable therapeutic targets are less well established. Chen and colleagues leverage a Drosophila GBM model to identify a conserved signaling axis downstream of the EGFR and PI3K that involves the death-associated protein kinase (Drak), a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase orthologous to the human kinase STK17A. Functional studies revealed that targeting this signaling axis attenuated mitosis and cytokinesis, providing a new pathway for therapeutic development in GBM.See related article by Chen et al., p. 1085. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Target enrichment is a critical component of targeted deep next-generation sequencing for the cost-effective and sensitive detection of mutations, which is predominantly performed by either hybrid selection or PCR. Despite the advantages of efficient enrichment, PCR-based methods preclude the identification of PCR duplicates and their subsequent removal. Recently, this limitation was overcome by assigning a unique molecular identifier(UMI) to each template molecule. Currently, several commercial library construction kits based on PCR enrichment are available for UMIs, but there have been no systematic studies to compare their performances. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performances of five commercial library kits from four vendors: the Archer Reveal ctDNA 28 Kit, NEBNext Direct Cancer HotSpot Panel, Nugen Ovation Custom Target Enrichment System, Qiagen Human Comprehensive Cancer Panel(HCCP), and Qiagen Human Actionable Solid Tumor Panel(HASTP).; RESULTS: We evaluated and compared the performances of the five kits using 50ng of genomic DNA for the library construction in terms of the library complexity, coverage uniformity, and errors in the UMIs. While the duplicate rates for all kits were dramatically decreased by identifying unique molecules with UMIs, the Qiagen HASTP achieved the highest library complexity based on the depth of unique coverage indicating superb library construction efficiency. Regarding the coverage uniformity, the kits from Nugen and NEB performed the best followed by the kits from Qiagen. We also analyzed the UMIs, including errors, which allowed us to adjust the depth of unique coverage and the length required for sufficient complexity. Based on these comparisons, we selected the Qiagen HASTP for further performance evaluations. The targeted deep sequencing method based on PCR target enrichment combined with UMI tagging sensitively detected mutations present at a frequency as low as 1% using 6.25ng of human genomic DNA as the starting material.; CONCLUSION: This study is the first systematic evaluation of commercial library construction kits for PCR-based targeted deep sequencing utilizing UMIs. Because the kits displayed significant variability in different quality metrics, our study offers a practical guideline for researchers to choose appropriate options for PCR-based targeted sequencing and useful benchmark data for evaluating new kits.

AB Tumor genetic heterogeneity may underlie poor clinical outcomes because diverse subclones could be comprised of metastatic and drug resistant cells. Targeted deep sequencing has been used widely as a diagnostic tool to identify actionable mutations in cancer patients. In this study, we evaluated the clinical utility of estimating tumor heterogeneity using targeted panel sequencing data. We investigated the prognostic impact of a tumor heterogeneity (TH) index on clinical outcomes, using mutational profiles from targeted deep sequencing data acquired from 1,352 patients across 8 cancer types. The TH index tended to be increased in high pathological stage disease in several cancer types, indicating clonal expansion of cancer cells as tumor progression proceeds. In colorectal cancer patients, TH index values also correlated significantly with clinical prognosis. Integration of the TH index with genomic and clinical features could improve the power of risk prediction for clinical outcomes. In conclusion, deep sequencing to determine the TH index could serve as a promising prognostic indicator in cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group evaluated rituximab treatment schedules for patients with newly-diagnosed low-tumor-burden follicular-lymphoma (FL). All patients received 4-weekly rituximab treatments as induction therapy. Clinically-responding patients were randomized to receive rituximab every 13weeks ("maintenance") vs. no additional rituximab until progression ("non-maintenance"). Based on "time-to-rituximab-failure (TTRF)", the study-committee reported there was no overall-benefit for maintenance rituximab in this setting. Tumor-reactive mAbs, like rituximab, trigger natural killer (NK) cells. NK-cell responses are regulated, in part, by interactions between killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on NK cells and their interactions with KIR-ligands. In a separate study of children with neuroblastoma treated with a different mAb, we found certain KIR/KIR-ligand genotypes associated with improved outcome. Here, we assessed whether a subset of FL patients show improved outcome from the maintenance rituximab based on these same KIR/KIR-ligand genotypes.; METHODS: Genotypes for KIR/KIR-ligand were determined and assessed for associations with outcome [duration of response, TTRF and % tumor shrinkage] as a post-hoc analysis of this phase III trial. Our primary objective was to assess specific KIR/KIR-ligand genotype associations, followed by separate prespecified KIR/KIR-ligand genotype associations in follow-up analyses. Statistical analyses for association of genotype with clinical outcome included: Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess duration of response and TTRF; analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for assessment of % tumor shrinkage.; RESULTS: We found that patients inheriting KIR2DL2 and its ligand (HLA-C1) along with KIR3DL1 and its ligand (HLA-Bw4) had improved outcome over patients without this genotype. In addition, patients with KIR2DL2 and HLA-C1 along with KIR3DL1 and HLA-Bw4 also showed improved duration of response and tumor shrinkage if they received maintenance, while patients without this genotype showed no such improvement when receiving maintenance.; CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here indicate that a subset of FL patients, identified by certain KIRs/KIR-ligands, have improved outcome and may benefit from additional rituximab treatment. Taken together, this suggests that the efficacy of tumor-reactive mAb treatment for some patients is influenced by KIRs on NK cells. However, prior to considering these genotypes in a clinically-actionable manner, these findings need independent validation in other studies.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of actionably high radiation dosages and to identify predictors of increased patient dosage.; BACKGROUND: Peripheral endovascular intervention using fluoroscopic imaging has become a mainstay of treatment for lower extremity peripheral artery disease but exposes patients to ionizing radiation.; METHODS: Patient radiation dosage, quantified as dose-area product (DAP), was obtained from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Peripheral Vascular Intervention Registry. The percentage of procedures exceeding a DAP of 500 Gy · cm2, the threshold above which follow-up for radiation-related adverse effects is indicated by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, was determined. A multivariate regression model was generated to identify patient and procedural factors associated with increasing DAP.; RESULTS: Among 17,174 procedures performed at 73 sites, patient DAP exceeded 500 Gy · cm2 in 7%. Independent predictors of increased patient DAP in order from greatest magnitude of effect included more proximal lesion location, bifurcation lesion, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, increasing lesion length,and increasing body mass index; antegrade vascular access, critical limb ischemia, and increasing age predicted decreased DAP.; CONCLUSIONS: Radiation dosage with the potential for tissue injury occurs in 1 of every 14 patients undergoing lower extremity endovascular interventions, and all such patients are exposed to the potential for subsequent malignancy. Pre-procedural assessment of patients' risk for elevated radiation dosage may allow targeted use of radiation mitigation strategies in patients at increased risk for elevated exposure.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with an overall five-year survival rate of ~16%. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~80% of all lung cancer cases, and the majority (40%) of these are adenocarcinomas. Loss of function point mutations in TP53 (46%) and activating mutations in KRAS (33%) are the most common mutations in human lung adenocarcinomas. Because neither of these genetic alterations are clinically actionable, chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment in patients with oncogenic KRAS driver mutations. However, chemoresistance to genotoxic agents such as docetaxel remains a major clinical challenge facing lung cancer patients. Here we show that ABL kinase allosteric inhibitors can be effectively used for the treatment of KrasG12D/+; p53-/- lung adenocarcinomas in an autochthonous mouse model. Unexpectedly, we found that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an ABL allosteric inhibitor promoted differentiation of lung adenocarcinomas from poorly differentiated tumors expressing basal cell markers to tumors expressing terminal differentiation markers in vivo, which rendered lung adenocarcinomas susceptible to chemotherapy. These findings uncover a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas with poor response to chemotherapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of all lung malignancies and its prognosis is dismal. Although early studies have shown promising clinical activity of immune checkpoint blockers, the immune composition and expression of potentially actionable immunostimulatory targets in this malignancy are poorly understood.; METHODS: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF), we measured the levels of 3 different B7 family ligands PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and major tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 90 SCLC samples represented in tissue microarray format. Associations between the marker levels, clinicopathological variables and survival were studied.; RESULTS: PD-L1 protein was detected in 7.3%, B7-H3 in 64.9% and B7-H4 in 2.6% of SCLC cases. The markers showed limited co-expression and were not associated with the level of TILs, age, gender and stage. Elevated B7-H4 was associated with shorter 5-year overall survival. The levels of CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TILs and the ratio of total/effector T-cells were significantly lower in SCLC than in non-small cell lung cancer. High levels of CD3+, but not CD8+ or CD20+ TILs were significantly associated with longer survival.; CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicate variable expression and clinical role of B7-family ligands in SCLC with predominant expression of the candidate target B7-H3 and the presence of a limited cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response. These results support the evaluation of B7-H3 blockers and/or pro-inflammatory therapies in SCLC.

AB More than 500,000 people experience homelessness in America each day. Local and federal solutions to the problem have had limited success because of the fragmentation of services and lack of valid and timely information. Billions of dollars spent to provide reliable, timely, and actionable information in health care have exposed the difficulty of establishing such a system using the prevalent information technology solutions. However, relying on successful examples of the use of blockchain to help refugee populations and poor farmers internationally, we have partnered to propose an innovative solution to this problem using the case of people experiencing homelessness in Austin, Texas. This paper aims to describe one of the first applications of blockchain technology for addressing homelessness in the United States by creating a digital identity for people experiencing homelessness and engaging emergency medical services and clinical providers. The authors argue that a lack of documentation to prove personal identity and the inability to access own records are major hurdles for empowering persons experiencing homelessness to be resilient and overcome the life challenges they face. Furthermore, it is argued that this lack of information causes misdiagnosis, duplication, and fragmentation in service delivery, which can be potentially addressed by blockchain technology. Further planning for creating a program on the ground with additional funding will demonstrate the results of using blockchain technology to establish digital identity for persons experiencing homelessness. ©Anjum Khurshid, Ashish Gadnis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Search and rescue after mass casualty incidents relies on robust data infrastructure. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA's) Task Force 1 (TF1) trains its volunteers to locate and virtually tag scene incidents using a global positioning satellite (GPS) device programmed with markers for each incident (Iron Sights). The authors performed a pilot study comparing Iron Sights to a Wi-Fi-based real-time incident geolocation and virtual tagging dashboard (Panacea) in creating a dynamic common operating picture.; DESIGN: Twenty-nine stations were placed at a predefined scene incident, each featuring a set of varying waypoint markers using standard FEMA/TF1 nomenclature. Two volunteers performed the experiment for both the Iron Sights and Panacea systems, digitally tagging all station waypoints.; SETTING: TF1 simulation training field.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Metrics compared included GPS location precision, marker accuracy, and delay between scene sweep and common operational picture (COP) generation.; RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-one waypoints were digitally tagged after excluding three stations for missing data. The average GPS location difference for all waypoints between Iron Sights and Panacea was 3.65 m. Marker tagging accuracy between Iron Sights and Panacea was equivalent and not statistically different (78.8 percent vs 66.2 percent, respectively, p = 0.11). Waypoints were tagged in 26.59 minutes and 10.55 minutes on average, respectively. Time from scene sweep to virtual COP generation was 7.97 minutes for Iron Sights after complete scene sweep and 37 seconds for Panacea for each waypoint posting in real-time.; CONCLUSIONS: Panacea generated the COP in real-time compared to a delay with Iron Sights while maintaining the same location precision and marker accuracy. This pilot trial successfully demonstrated the ability to provide real-time actionable intelligence to incident commanders during mass casualty search and rescue missions. Larger field trials are recommended to refine the system and broaden its capabilities.

AB BACKGROUND: Routine immediate postoperative laboratory studies, including metabolic panels and hematologic profiles, are commonly ordered after arthroplasty procedures. However, their values only occasionally influence management. This study investigated the clinical utility and value of these tests.; METHODS: A large retrospective cohort study of 18,935 patients spanning a 6-year period from 2008 to 2013 from a single high-volume institution was evaluated. Only immediate postoperative labs drawn on postoperative day 0 in the recovery room were included in the study. Complete blood counts (CBC) and basic metabolic panels (BMP) were reviewed, and ranges of abnormal were set for each lab test based on values significant enough to impact patient management. Cost effectiveness calculations were made based on current cost of the laboratory tests.; RESULTS: Actionably low hemoglobin values ( < 8 g/dL) were found in 1.44% of the overall cohort. Unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty was associated with the fewest hemoglobin abnormalities at 0.59%. Primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty was associated with abnormal hemoglobin values in 1.81% of cases. Significant electrolyte abnormalities were far less common, with hyperkalemia (> 6.5 mEq/L) in 0.19%, hyponatremia ( < 120 mEq/L) in 0.01% and elevated creatinine (> 2.0 mg/dL) was found in 0.25%. Hemoglobin values were calculated at a cost of $1,710 to detect a single significantly abnormal result. The cost to detect a single actionably abnormal BMP value was $1,000.; CONCLUSIONS: Routine immediate postoperative laboratory tests represent a high institutional cost and are seldom abnormal enough to warrant a change in patient management. The routine use of these tests can likely be safely eliminated in uncomplicated primary unilateral arthroplasty procedures.

AB Identifying and planning strategies that support a healthy lifestyle or manage a chronic disease often require patient-provider collaboration. For example, people with healthy eating goals often share everyday food, exercise, or sleep data with health coaches or nutritionists to find opportunities for change, and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often gather food and symptom data as part of working with providers to diagnose and manage symptoms. However, a lack of effective support often prevents health experts from reviewing large amounts of data in time-constrained visits, prevents focusing on individual goals, and prevents generating correct, individualized, and actionable recommendations. To examine how to design photo-based diaries to help people and health experts exchange knowledge and focus on collaboration goals when reviewing the data together, we designed and developed Foodprint, a photo-based food diary. Foodprint includes three components: (1) A mobile app supporting lightweight data collection, (2) a web app with photo-based visualization and quantitative visualizations supporting collaborative reflection, and (3) a pre-visit note communicating an individual's expectations and questions to experts. We deployed Foodprint in two studies: (1) with 17 people with healthy eating goals and 7 health experts, and (2) with 16 IBS patients and 8 health experts. Building upon the lens of boundary negotiating artifacts and findings from two field studies, our research contributes design principles to (1) prepare individuals to collect data relevant to their health goals and for collaboration, (2) help health experts focus on an individual's eating context, experiences, and goals in collaborative review, and (3) support individuals and experts to develop individualized, actionable plans and strategies.

AB OBJECTIVES: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is an aggressive malignant tumor, and biomarker-based clinical trials for this cancer are currently ongoing. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a safe procedure and enables pathological diagnoses; however, it is uncertain whether a tiny tumor sample of BTC obtained through EUS-FNA can be analyzed for diverse genetic alterations in the development and tolerance of BTC. Thus, we aimed to verify the feasibility of genetic analyses with EUS-FNA samples of BTC.; METHODS: Targeted amplicon sequencing using a cancer gene panel with 50 genes was performed with tissue samples of 21 BTC patients obtained through EUS-FNA with a novel rapid on-site process compared with paired peripheral blood samples.; RESULTS: Pathogenic gene alterations were successfully identified in 20 out of 21 patients (95.2%) with EUS-FNA specimens of BTC, which included 19 adenocarcinomas and 2 adenosquamous carcinomas. Eighty single nucleotide variants and 8 indels in 39 genes were identified in total, and 28 pathogenic alterations in 14 genes were identified (average, 1.4 alterations per patient). The most common alterations were TP53, KRAS, and CDKN2A in gallbladder carcinoma; TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; and TP53 and SMAD4 in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Actionable gene alterations (BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and IDH1) were identified in 7 out of 21 patients.; CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach in genetic analysis using targeted amplicon sequencing with BTC specimens obtained through EUS-FNA was feasible and enabled us to identify genomic alterations.

AB Practical cancer genome medicine requires large-scale data analysis for many types of biological data such as cancer driver mutations, aberrantly methylated regions, gene expression also biological knowledge from literature. Machine learning algorithms play an important role in bioinformatics of clinical oncology. In this review, we examine the applications of machine learning algorithm on recent research of cancer genome medicine. As an introduction, we consider relationship between artificial intelligence(AI)and machine learning and characterize the technical advantages of deep learning. The later part of this article examines 4 research publications within 3 domains. That includes comprehensive research about actionable mutations, novel approach for identifying activated Ras pathway and feasible methodologies to increase sensitivity of detecting cancer with cell-free DNA from 2 different research groups.

AB "Code-switching"-the mixing of languages, dialects, tones, or lexicons within a single conversation-is a prevalent linguistic phenomenon that has been described thoroughly in the social science literature. However, it is relatively unknown to the medical community despite its clear implications for clinicians as they navigate their role in the physician-patient relationship. As multilingualism and other forms of mixed speech become increasingly common in the urban and globally minded populations of America's modern cities, physicians must be cognizant of how they use their language skills-such as code-switching-to communicate with their patients in an ethical, supportive, and non-offensive manner. Multidisciplinary literature, case studies, and thought experiments on the subject provide an actionable framework by which health professionals can work toward achieving this goal of cultural competence.

AB PURPOSE: Electronic consultation (eConsult) services can improve access to specialist advice. Little is known, however, about whether and how often primary care clinicians adhere to the advice they receive. We evaluated how primary care clinicians use recommendations conveyed by specialists via the Champlain BASE (Building Access to Specialists through eConsultation) eConsult service and how eConsult affects clinical management of patients in primary care.; METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis based on a retrospective chart audit of 291 eConsults done between January 20, 2017 and August 31, 2017 at the Bruyere Family Health Team, located in Ottawa, Canada. Patients' charts were reviewed until 6 months after specialist response for the following main outcomes: implementation of specialist advice by primary care clinicians, communication of the results to the patients, method, and time frame of communication.; RESULTS: Primary care clinicians adhered to specialist advice in 82% of cases. Adherence ranged from 62% to 93% across recommendation categories. Questions asked by primary care clinicians related to diagnosis (63%), management (27%), drug treatment (10%), and procedures (1%). Recommendations of the eConsult were communicated to patients in 79% of cases, most often by face-to-face visit (38%), telephone call (32%), or use of the patient portal (9%). Communication occurred in a median of 5 days.; CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence of barriers to implementing specialist advice with use of eConsult, which suggests recommendations given through service were actionable. With a high primary care clinician adherence to specialist recommendations and primary care clinician-to-patient communication, we conclude that eConsult delivers good-quality care and improves patient management. © 2019 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

AB There is growing public demand that research participants receive all of their results, regardless of whether clinical action is indicated. Instead of the standard practice of returning only actionable results, we propose a reconceptualization called "return of value" to encompass the varied ways in which research participants value specific results and more general information they receive beyond actionable results. Our proposal is supported by a national survey of a diverse sample, which found that receiving research results would be valuable to most (78.5percent) and would make them more likely to trust researchers (70.3percent). Respondents highly valued results revealing genetic effects on medication response and predicting disease risk, as well as information about nearby clinical trials and updates on how their data were used. The information most valued varied by education, race/ethnicity, and age. Policies are needed to enable return of information in ways that recognize participants' differing informational needs and values.

AB Context: Elucidating the genomic landscape of sporadic parathyroid carcinoma (PC) has been limited by low tumor incidence.; Objective: Identify driver mutations of sporadic PC and potential actionable pathways.; Methods: Patients undergoing surgical resection for sporadic PC between 1980 and 2016 at MD Anderson Cancer Center were identified. Patients with sporadic PC according to World Health Organization diagnostic criteria and with available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) PC tumor tissue were included and their clinical data analyzed to assess extent of disease. Patients with parathyroid tumors of uncertain malignancy or atypical parathyroid neoplasms were excluded. Thirty-one patients meeting diagnostic criteria had available tissue for analysis. FFPE PC tumors were subjected to DNA extraction and next-generation whole-exome sequencing. All variant calls are single-algorithm only. Twenty-nine samples passed quality assurance after DNA extraction.; Main Outcome Measures: Somatic or private germline mutations present in sporadic PC and identification of pathways involved in tumorigenesis.; Results: We identified 35 genes with considerable mutational load; only eight genes were previously identified in other PC cohorts. These genes mediate critical processes, including chromosome organization, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulations. Gene mutations involved in MAPK signaling and immune response are also heavily implicated. These findings are limited by inherent molecular artifacts in FFPE tissue analysis and the absence of matched germline DNA. Additionally, variant calls are only single algorithm and may include false-positive/negative calls.; Conclusion: We identified 33 candidate driver genes of sporadic PC, in addition to previously known driver genes CDC73 and MEN1.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess pregnant women's views and preferences on noninvasive prenatal whole genome sequencing.; METHODS: A survey was offered to 805 pregnant women receiving prenatal care in practices affiliated with a large, tertiary care maternity hospital. Respondents were asked to envision undergoing prenatal whole genome sequencing and discuss their preferences and reasons for receiving different categories of genomic results, organized by actionability, severity, prevalence, and age of onset. The survey also queried respondents on their preferred role for clinicians in prenatal whole genome sequencing decision-making, and on their demographics and genetic literacy.; RESULTS: From June to August 2017, a total of 553 respondents returned the survey (response rate=68.7%). Respondents were most likely to want information regarding serious treatable childhood-onset conditions (89.7%) and least likely to want to receive information about nonmedical traits from prenatal whole genome sequencing (40%). The most frequently cited reason for wanting medical prenatal whole genome sequencing results was "to prepare financially, medically, or psychologically for a child with special needs." In total, 10.5% of respondents wanted clear recommendations from clinicians about the categories of information that are most appropriate to test for, 44.7% wanted clear recommendations plus all options presented, 26.2% wanted all options presented and joint decision-making, and 13.2% wanted all options presented and independent decision-making.; CONCLUSION: Respondents generally preferred to receive all categories of genetic results pertaining to medical conditions and wanted the information to prepare. More than half of respondents wanted (at minimum) clear recommendations from clinicians when deciding which prenatal whole genome sequencing results to receive.

AB AIMS: Although there have been excellent reports in the literature of validating next-generation sequencing, comparisons between two systems are not often published due to cost and time. We set out to establish that targetable mutations could be reliably detected with different gene panels and different chemistries using a common bioinformatics pipeline for meaningful comparisons to be made.; METHODS: After running selected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples through QPCR, Sanger sequencing and the 50 gene hotspot v2 panel from Life Technologies to determine standard-of-care variants, we compared the Oncomine panel from Life Technologies performed on a Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and the eight-gene actionable panel from Qiagen performed on a MiSeq platform. We used a common bioinformatics program following the creation of respective VCF files.; RESULTS: Both panels were accurate to above 90%, the actionable panel workflow was easier to perform but the lowest effective starting DNA load was obtained on the Oncomine workflow at 4ng. Such minimal DNA can help with samples where there is limited material such as those for lung cancer molecular studies. We also discuss gene panel content and propose that increasing the gene profile of a panel will not benefit clinical laboratories where standard-of-care testing is all that is required.; CONCLUSIONS: Once recognised, it may be cost-effective for such laboratories to begin validation with an appropriate bioinformatics pipeline for targeted multigene hotspot molecular testing. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

AB OBJECTIVES: Image-guided tissue sampling in the workup of suspected lymphoma can be performed by core needle biopsy (CNB) or CNB with fine-needle aspiration (FNA). We compared the yield of clinically actionable diagnoses between these methods of tissue sampling.; METHODS: All ultrasound-guided percutaneous peripheral lymph node biopsies from 2010 to 2017 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed for biopsy type (CNB versus CNB+FNA), prior diagnosis of lymphoma, size of the target lymph node, number of cores, length of core specimens, and pathologic diagnosis. Lymphoma and lymphoid tissue were included; metastatic disease and nonlymphoid tissue were excluded. An oncologist specializing in lymphoma independently determined whether an actionable diagnosis could be made with the pathologic results in the context of the patient's medical record. chi2 analyses and univariable/multivariable logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses.; RESULTS: Of 578 lymph node biopsies, 306 (53%) had a prior diagnosis of lymphoma; 273 (47%) were CNB, and 305 (53%) were CNB+FNA. There was no significant difference between biopsy types (CNB versus CNB+FNA) in the number of cores (median [25th, 75th percentiles], 3 [3, 4] versus 4 [3, 4]; P=.47) or total length of tissue (4.1 [2.5, 6.1] versus 3.7 [2.3, 6] cm; P=.09). There was no difference in obtaining an actionable diagnosis between biopsy types after controlling for a known history of lymphoma (P=.271) or after controlling for the number of core specimens (P=.826).; CONCLUSIONS: In cases of suspected lymphoma, CNB without FNA was sufficient to obtain an actionable diagnosis. © 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in US Hispanic females. This demographic is more likely to present with later-stage disease and require more extensive surgical treatment, including axillary lymph node dissection, which increases risk of lymphedema. The Spanish-speaking Hispanic population has a lower health literacy level and requires materials contoured to their unique needs. The aim of this study was to evaluate online Spanish lymphedema resources.; METHODS: A web search using the Spanish term "linfedema" was performed, and the top 10 websites were identified. Each was analyzed using validated metrics to assess readability, understandability, actionability, and cultural sensitivity using the SOL (Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook, Spanish), Patient Education and Materials Assessment for Understandability and Actionability (Patient Education and Assessment Tool), and Cultural Sensitivity and Assessment Tool (CSAT), respectively. Online materials were assessed by 2 independent evaluators, and interrater reliability was determined.; RESULTS: Online lymphedema material in Spanish had a mean reading grade level of 9.8 (SOL). Average understandability and actionability scores were low at 52% and 36%, respectively. The mean CSAT was 2.27, below the recommended value of 2.5. Cohen kappa for interrater reliability was greater than 0.81 for the Patient Education and Assessment Tool and CSAT, suggesting excellent agreement between raters.; CONCLUSIONS: Available online Spanish lymphedema resources are written at an elevated reading level and are inappropriate for a population with lower health literacy levels. As patients continue to use the internet as their primary source for health information, health care entities must improve the quality of provided Spanish resources in order to optimize patient comprehension.

AB Better knowledge of the tumor genomic landscapes has helped to develop more effective targeted drugs. However, there is no tool to interpret targetability of genomic alterations assessed by next-generation sequencing in the context of clinical practice. Our aim is to rank the level of evidence of individual recurrent genomic alterations observed in breast cancer based on the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) in order to help the clinicians to prioritize treatment. Analyses of databases suggested that there are around 40 recurrent driver alterations in breast cancer. ERBB2 amplification, germline BRCA1/2 mutations, PIK3CA mutations were classified tier of evidence IA based on large randomized trials showing antitumor activity of targeted therapies in patients presenting the alterations. NTRK fusions and microsatellite instability (MSI) were ranked IC. ESR1 mutations and PTEN loss were ranked tier IIA, and ERBB2 mutations and AKT1 mutations tier IIB. Somatic BRCA 1/2 mutations, MDM2 amplifications and ERBB 3 mutations were ranked tier III. Seventeen genes were ranked tier IV based on preclinical evidence. Finally, FGFR1 and CCND1 were ranked tier X alterations because previous studies have shown lack of actionability. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the BD Onclarity human papillomavirus (HPV) assay performance and risk values for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or higher and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) or higher during Papanicolaou/HPV cotesting in a negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancies (NILM) population.; METHODS: In total, 22,383 of the 33,858 enrolled women were 30 years or older with NILM cytology. HPV+ and a subset of HPV- patients (3,219/33,858 combined; 9.5%) were referred to colposcopy/biopsy.; RESULTS: Overall, 7.9% of women were Onclarity positive; HPV 16 had the highest prevalence (1.5%). Verification bias-adjusted (VBA) CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher prevalences were 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. Onclarity had VBA CIN2 or higher (44.1%) and CIN3 or higher (69.5%) sensitivities, as well as CIN2 or higher (92.4%) and CIN3 or higher (92.3%) specificities-all similar to Hybrid Capture 2. HPV 16, 18, 45, and the other 11 genotypes had CIN3 or higher risks of 6.9%, 2.6%, 1.1%, and 2.2%, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Onclarity is clinically validated for cotesting in NILM women. Genotyping actionably stratifies women at greater CIN3 or higher risk. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

AB The neurotrophic tropomyosin or tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) genes (1-3) are proto-oncogenes that when activated are encountered in a wide array of tumours. The recent advent of very specific and selective inhibitors of their gene fusions makes the NRTK gene fusions actionable. NRTK gene fusions are very characteristic of specific tumours: salivary mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, breast secretory carcinoma, infantile fibrosarcoma and congenital mesoblastic nephroma. Over 90% of these tumours bear NTRK gene fusions. While next-generation sequencing is the current platform of choice for the detection of NTRK fusions, immunohistochemistry also shows great promise. Immunohistochemical localisation of the fusion protein to the nucleus, cytoplasm, nuclear membrane and cell membrane is indicative of specific gene fusions involving the NTRK genes. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB Phytophthora tentaculata was detected for the first time in North America in 2012 in a nursery on sticky monkeyflower plant (Diplacus aurantiacus) and again in 2014 on outplanted native plants. At that time, this species was listed as a federally actionable and reportable pathogen by the USDA. As a result of these detections, California native plant nurseries were surveyed to determine the prevalence of Phytophthora species on native plant nursery stock. A total of 402 samples were collected from 26 different native plant nurseries in California between 2014 and 2016. Sampling focused on plants with symptoms of root and crown rot. Symptomatic tissue was collected and tested by immunoassay, culture, and molecular techniques (PCR). Identifications were made using sequences from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region, a portion of the trnM-trnP-trnM, or the atp9-nad9 mitochondrial regions. Phytophthora was confirmed from 149 of the 402 samples (37%), and from plants in 22 different host families. P. tentaculata was the most frequently detected species in our survey, followed by P. cactorum and members of the P. cryptogea complex. Other species include P. cambivora, P. cinnamomi, P. citricola, P. hedraiandra, P. megasperma, P. multivora, P. nicotianae, P. niederhauserii, P. parvispora, P. pini, P. plurivora, and P. riparia. A few Phytophthora sequences generated from mitochondrial regions could not be assigned to a species. Although this survey was limited to a relatively small number of California native plant nurseries, Phytophthora species were detected from three quarters of them (77%). In addition to sticky monkeyflower, P. tentaculata was detected from seven other hosts, expanding the number of associated hosts. During this survey, P. parvispora was detected for the first time in North America from symptomatic crowns and roots of the nonnative Mexican orange blossom (Choisya ternata). Pathogenicity of P. parvispora and P. nicotianae was confirmed on this host. These findings document the widespread occurrence of Phytophthora spp. in native plant nurseries and highlight the potential risks associated with outplanting infested nursery-grown stock into residential gardens and wildlands.

AB OBJECTIVE: The effect of demographics and societal determinants on imaging follow-up rates is not clear. The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics of patients with imaging findings representing possible cancer who undergo follow-up imaging versus those who do not to better understand factors that contribute to follow-up completion.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 1588 patients with indeterminate abdominal imaging findings consecutively registered between July 1, 2013, and March 20, 2014, were reviewed. Several patient characteristics, including distance between patients' home zip codes and the flagship hospital of the health system were compared between the groups who did and did not undergo follow-up imaging. Subgroup analyses based on the location of the index examination were also performed.; RESULTS: Among the 1513 (36.62%) included patients, 554 did not undergo follow-up abdominal imaging within 1 year of the index examination. The same was true of 270 of 938 (28.78%) outpatients and 168 of 279 (60.21%) emergency department patients. Eighty-nine of 959 (9.28%) patients who underwent follow-up imaging were younger than 40 years, compared with 76 of 554 (13.72%) patients who did not undergo follow-up imaging (p = 0.005). Fifty-four of 959 (5.63%) patients who underwent follow-up imaging were older than 80 years, compared with 70 of 554 (12.64%) patients who did not undergo follow-up imaging (p < 0.001). More white patients (587 of 959 vs 301 of 554, p = 0.007) and fewer black patients (204 of 554 versus 270 of 959, p < 0.001) were found in the follow-up imaging group. Greater distance from the flagship hospital correlated with less follow-up in the outpatient subgroup only (p = 0.03).; CONCLUSION: Emergency department patients and patients at the extremes of age are less likely to complete follow-up imaging. Insurance status and race and ethnicity may affect follow-up completion rates. The relationship between distance to hospital and follow-up completion requires further investigation.

AB Genomic amplification at 9p24.1, including the loci for JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2, has recently been described as a mechanism of resistance in postchemotherapy, triple-negative breast cancer. This genomic signature holds significant promise as a prognostic biomarker and has implications for targeted therapy with JAK2 inhibitors, as well as with immunotherapy. To guide future screening strategies, the frequency of these alterations was determined. A total of 5399 cases were included in the study. This encompassed 2890 institutional cases tested by the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets assay and 2509 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The combined incidence of 9p24.1 amplifications in both the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets and TCGA cohorts was 1.0% (56/5399 cases) and showed a >10-fold higher incidence in triple-negative breast cancer (triple-negative: 5.1%; non-triple-negative: 0.5%). Tumor mutation burden and stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, parameters used to assess response to immunotherapy, were not significantly higher for these cases. The significance of genomic losses at 9p24.1 is unclear, and further studies are needed. Herein, we studied the spectrum of copy number alterations in breast cancer cases within our institutional clinical sequencing cohort and those profiled by TCGA to determine the frequency of genomic alterations thatmay predict response or resistance to JAK2 inhibitors and/or immunotherapy.

AB Objective To estimate the effect of a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) intervention on asthma-related emergency room (ER) visits of pediatric patients. Methods Patients receiving care at pediatric primary care practices participating in the Florida Pediatric Medical Home Demonstration Project as well as pediatric patients treated at non-participating clinics were identified from 4 years of claims and enrollment data. We estimate several fixed effects logistic regression models using one pre-treatment year and three post-treatment years to investigate whether asthma-related ER visits decreased because of the PCMH intervention. Results The estimation suggests that the intervention did have a negative effect on asthma-related ER visits in the earlier part of the intervention (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.16-0.73). However, this effect was not detected in the later years. Because fixed effects models require repeated observations on the same individual, we believe our estimations of the PCMH model's impact is more accurate than previous studies. Conclusion for Practice Reducing asthma ER visits is a task that might be immediately actionable for PCMH practices, or those undergoing transformation. Our results adds to the others suggesting positive impacts of the PCMH.

AB BACKGROUND: An emphasis on precision health (PH) has stimulated precision medicine studies to focus on the interplay of biological, behavioral, and environmental factors with disease risks, treatments, prognoses, and outcomes affecting health disparities. It is imperative, as well, that improving health equity among underserved populations remains central to the efforts and aims of PH.; OBJECTIVES: The aim if this study was to apply the transdisciplinary ConNECT Framework: A Model for Advancing Behavioral Medicine Science and Practice to Foster Health Equity to PH by integrating a population health agenda for reducing health disparities.; METHODS: There are five ConNECT principles: (a) integrating context; (b) fostering a norm of inclusion; (c) ensuring equitable diffusion of innovations; (d) harnessing communication technology; and (e) prioritizing specialized training as an organizing framework to PH, including examples of how to integrate behavioral and socioecological determinants to better understand the contexts of individuals, systems, and place to design targeted treatments and interventions.; RESULTS: We describe proactive, actionable strategies for the systematic application of ConNECT Framework principles to address health equity via the PH initiative. Context and implications for nursing research and practice are also described.; DISCUSSION: The ConNECT Framework emphasizes that diversity inclusion is imperative for true population health benefit from PH, broadly in public health, behavioral medicine, medicine, and nursing, to equip health researchers and practitioners to account for contextual socioecologic data that can be aligned with biologic data for more population responsive and individually tailored interventions to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases.

AB Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. Although the cure rate of ALL has greatly improved, a considerable number of patients suffer from relapse of leukemia. Therefore, ALL remains the leading cause of death from cancer during childhood. To improve the cure rate of these patients, precisely detecting patients with high risk of relapse and incorporating new targeted therapies are urgently needed. This study investigated inexpensive, rapid, next-generation sequencing of more than 150 cancer-related genes for matched diagnostic, remission, and relapse samples of 17 patients (3months to 15years old) with relapsed ALL. In this analysis, we identified 16 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion/deletion variants and 19 copy number variants (CNVs) at diagnosis and 28 SNVs and insertion/deletion variants and 22 CNVs at relapse. With these genetic alterations, we could detect several B cell precursor ALL patients with high-risk gene alterations who were not stratified into the highest-risk group (5/8, 62.5%). We also detected potentially actionable genetic variants in about half of the patients (8/17, 47.1%). Among them, we found that one patient harbored germline TP53 mutation as a secondary finding. This inexpensive, rapid method can be immediately applied as clinical sequencing and could lead to better management of these patients and potential improvement in the survival rate in childhood ALL.

AB BACKGROUND: Inflammation is linked to prostate cancer progression and is mediated by NF-kappaB. Tristetraprolin is a key node of NF-kappaB activation and we investigated its biological and prognostic role in lethal prostate cancer.; METHODS: In vitro assays assessed the function of tristetraprolin and the association between low mRNA tristetraprolin levels and lethal prostate cancer (metastatic disease or death) was assessed across independent prostatectomy cohorts: (i) nested case-control studies from Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study, and (ii) prostatectomy samples from Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Tristetraprolin expression levels in prostatectomy samples from patients with localized disease and biopsies of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were assessed in a Cornell University cohort.; RESULTS: In vitro tristetraprolin expression was inversely associated with NF-kappaB-controlled genes, proliferation, and enzalutamide sensitivity. Men with localized prostate cancer and lower quartile of tumor tristetraprolin expression had a significant, nearly two-fold higher risk of lethal prostate cancer after adjusting for known clinical and histologic prognostic features (age, RP Gleason score, T-stage). Tristetraprolin expression was also significantly lower in mCRPC compared with localized prostate cancer.; CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of tristetraprolin in human prostate cancer prostatectomy tissue are associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and may serve as an actionable prognostic and predictive biomarker.; IMPACT: There is a clear need for improved biomarkers to identify patients with localized prostate cancer in need of treatment intensification, such as adjuvant testosterone suppression, or treatment de-intensification, such as active surveillance. Tristetraprolin levels may serve as informative biomarkers in localized prostate cancer. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB The complexity and heterogeneity of patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy renders traditional disease-oriented guidelines often inadequate and complicates clinical decision making. To address this challenge, guidelines have been developed on multimorbidity or polypharmacy. To systematically analyse their recommendations, we conducted a systematic guideline review using the Ariadne principles for managing multimorbidity as analytical framework. The information synthesis included a multistep consensus process involving 18 multidisciplinary experts from seven countries. We included eight guidelines (four each on multimorbidity and polypharmacy) and extracted about 250 recommendations. The guideline addressed (i) the identification of the target population (risk factors); (ii) the assessment of interacting conditions and treatments: medical history, clinical and psychosocial assessment including physiological status and frailty, reviews of medication and encounters with healthcare providers highlighting informational continuity; (iii) the need to incorporate patient preferences and goal setting: eliciting preferences and expectations, the process of shared decision making in relation to treatment options and the level of involvement of patients and carers; (iv) individualized management: guiding principles on optimization of treatment benefits over possible harms, treatment communication and the information content of medication/care plans; (v) monitoring and follow-up: strategies in care planning, self-management and medication-related aspects, communication with patients including safety instructions and adherence, coordination of care regarding referral and discharge management, medication appropriateness and safety concerns. The spectrum of clinical and self-management issues varied from guiding principles to specific recommendations and tools providing actionable support. The limited availability of reliable risk prediction models, feasible interventions of proven effectiveness and decision aids, and limited consensus on appropriate outcomes of care highlight major research deficits. An integrated approach to both multimorbidity and polypharmacy should be considered in future guidelines. © 2018 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations help individuals exercise autonomy and make informed decisions about their care. There are many ACP resources available to support the process of advance care planning, yet available resources not universally accepted and under-utilized in clinical practice.; OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically evaluate commonly available general ACP patient educational resources using a comprehensive approach to assess elements ranging from resource inclusion to health literacy.; DESIGN: Systematic evaluation of general ACP educational resources METHODS: ACP educational resources were systematically identified and evaluated for: Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) score, Flesch-Kincaid reading ease and grade level, cost, languages available, and categories of content including Advance directive/Healthcare proxy, Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Living will, values, preferences, and goals.; RESULTS: Educational resources (n = 20) were identified. These resources were classified as information resources, workbooks, interactive websites, or and activities/conversation guides. The average PEMAT understandability score was 86 (range 58-100) and the average actionability was 90 (range 40-100). Two resources met Flesch-Kincaid reading ease and grade level. Eight were available in English only, nine in two languages, and three in more than two languages. Three explicitly discussed completion of POLST forms. The majority of the resources adequately addressed the content of advanced directives and health care proxy, values, goals, and preferences for future care. The level of time commitment required to use each resource also varied considerably.; CONCLUSION: We present a comprehensive evaluation of resources to support ACP. Using the Transtheoretical Model, we provide a guide for the use of these educational resources based on patient readiness. This review allows clinicians to identify aspects of each resource that may be helpful in preparing older adults for future healthcare decsions. Our analysis has identified the need to continue to refine these educational resources so that they can reach a broad population with varying needs. Advance care planning (ACP) conversations help individuals exercise autonomy and make informed decisions about their care. There are many ACP educational resources available to support the process of advance care planning, yet available resources are not universally accepted and under-utilized in clinical practice. We present a comprehensive evaluation of 20 educational resources to support ACP. Educational resources were identified and evaluated for: Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) score, Flesch-Kincaid reading ease and grade level, cost, languages available, and categories of content. Using the Transtheoretical Model, we provide a guide for the use of these educational resources based on patient readiness.

AB Societal impact is an increasingly important imperative of academic funding. However, there is little research to date documenting how impact is accomplished in practice. Drawing on insights from Actor-Network Theory, we explore the research-policy interface within an interdisciplinary research project on the relationships between air pollution and human health. Health policy impact was important to the researchers for moral as well as pragmatic reasons but it was a goal that was seen as potentially in tension with that of doing science. In fields such as air pollution and health, networks of policymakers and researchers are inevitably entangled, and we found that processes of engagement operated to delineate science from policy. Health was initially black-boxed and under-explicated, used as a signifier in itself for societal impact. By mobilising networks of policy actors, brought together in workshops to rank the importance of policy scenarios for the research team, the connections between air pollution and health were materialised and made actionable. This was achieved by framing existing data sets, emission technologies, policy expertise, pollutant species and human health in particular ways and, in doing so, excluding others. The process of linking air pollution and health research to achieve societal impact not only influenced how these phenomena were known but, critically, enabled and constrained potential policy responses. Tracing these research arrangements made the material discursive processes of 'impact' visible and analysable as objects of social science scholarship, and therefore generated a productive site for critically engaging with processes of environment and health science and policy.

AB Methionine restriction, i.e., a partial depletion of the essential sulfur amino acid methionine from nutrition, extends lifespan in model organisms including yeast, nematodes, mice and rats. Recent results indicate that this strategy also prolongs health span and longevity in 2 short-lived strains of mice (with the LmnaG609G/G609G or zmpste24-/- genotypes) that represent animal models of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). The beneficial effects of methionine restriction on HGPS could be linked to reduced inflammation, and improved DNA stability, as well as the normalization of lipid and bile acid metabolism. Previous work has established that behavioral, nutritional, pharmacological and genetic manipulations that extend longevity in model organisms are only efficient if they induce increased autophagic flux. Methionine restriction extends lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in an Atg5- and Atg7-dependent fashion, supporting the notion that methionine restriction may indeed mediate its antiaging effects through the induction of macroautophagy/autophagy as well. Based on these findings, we speculate that autophagy might constitute an actionable therapeutic target to treat progeroid syndromes.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) and serrated polyp detection rate (SDR) vary significantly among colonoscopists. Colonoscopy inspection quality (CIQ) is the quality with which a colonoscopist inspects for polyps and may explain some of this variation. We aimed to determine the relationship between CIQ and historical ADRs and SDRs in a cohort of colonoscopists and assess whether there is variation in CIQ components (fold examination, cleaning, and luminal distension) among colonoscopists with similar ADRs and SDRs.; METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study to assess CIQ among 17 high-volume colonoscopists at an academic medical center. Over 6 weeks, we video-recorded >28 colonoscopies per colonoscopist and randomly selected 7 colonoscopies per colonoscopist for evaluation. Six raters graded CIQ using an established scale, with a maximum whole colon score of75.; RESULTS: We evaluated 119 colonoscopies. The median whole-colon CIQ score was 50.1/75. Whole-colon CIQ score (r=0.71; P<.01) and component scores (fold examination r=0.74; cleaning r=0.67; distension r=0.77; all P<.01) correlated with ADR. Proximal colon CIQ score (r=0.67; P<.01) and component scores (fold examination r=0.71; cleaning r=0.62; distension r=0.65; all P<.05) correlated with SDR. CIQ component scores differed significantly between colonoscopists with similar ADRs and SDRs for most of the CIQ skills.; CONCLUSION: In a prospective observational study, we found CIQ and CIQ components to correlate with ADR and SDR. Colonoscopists with similar ADRs and SDRs differ in their performance of the 3 CIQ components-specific, actionable feedback might improve colonoscopy technique. Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

AB INTRODUCTION: Adequate sleep is fundamental to wellness and recovery from illnesses and lack thereof is associated with disease onset and progression resulting in adverse health outcomes. Measuring sleep quality and sleep apnea (SA) at the point of care utilizing data that is already collected is feasible and cost effective, using validated methods to unlock sleep information embedded in the data. The objective of this study is to determine the utility of automated analysis of a stored, robust signal widely collected in hospital and outpatient settings, a single lead electrocardiogram (ECG), using clinically validated algorithms, cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC), to objectively and accurately identify SA.; METHODS: Retrospective analysis of de-identified PSG data with expert level scoring of Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) dividing the cohort into severe OSA (AHI>30), moderate (AHI 15-30), mild (AHI 5-15), and no disease (AHI<5) was compared with automated CPC analysis of a single lead ECG collected during sleep for each subject. Statistical analysis was used to compare the two methods.; RESULTS: Sixty-eight ECG recordings were analyzed. CPC identified patients with moderate to severe SA with sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 81%, and agreement of 93%, LR+ (positive likelihood ratio) 5.20, LR- (negative likelihood ratio) 0.00 and kappa 0.85 compared with manual scoring of AHI.; CONCLUSION: The automated CPC analysis of stored single lead ECG data often collected during sleep in the clinical setting can accurately identify sleep apnea, providing medically actionable information that can aid clinical decisions.

AB Value-driven health care models that aim to improve patient outcomes while managing total costs of care require better access to integrated health care data. Health care organizations that integrate data from multiple platforms (e.g., pharmacy, medical, electronic medical records, and lab data) can better streamline and guide effective, efficient, and coordinated utilization and care management programs. To address strategies for integrating health care data, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy convened a forum in Baltimore, MD, on September 25-26, 2018. The goal of the forum was to develop a roadmap for managed care entities interested in (a) managing medications across the spectrum of health care-regardless of whether the medications are covered by a medical or pharmacy benefit; (b) driving performance improvements in clinical quality with integrated datasets; (c) streamlining care transitions and case management; and (d) facilitating the development of datasets formatted for use in value-based care contracts. Forum deliberations highlighted the need for data integration in value-based health care systems, explored making data actionable through rapid and predictive analytics of integrated datasets, identified the challenges of doing so, and developed a practical roadmap for managing the total cost of care through data integration. Health care leaders representing health plans, integrated delivery systems, pharmacy benefit managers, employers, the federal government, technology companies, data integrators, standards development leaders, and biopharmaceutical companies participated in the forum, which was supported in collaboration with Abbvie, Alkermes, Amgen, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Merck, National Pharmaceutical Council, PhRMA, Takeda, and Xcenda.

AB The process of metastatic dissemination begins when malignant cells start to migrate and leave the primary mass. It is now known that neoplastic progression is associated with a combination of genetic and epigenetic events. Cancer is a genetic disease and this pathogenic concept is the basis for a new classification of tumours, based precisely on the presence of definite genetic lesions to which the clones are addicted. Regarding the scatter factor receptors MET and Recepteur d'Origin Nantais (RON), it is recognised that MET is an oncogene necessary for a narrow subset of tumours (MET-addicted) while it works as an adjuvant metastogene for many others. This notion highlights that the anti-MET therapy can be effective as the first line of intervention in only a few MET-addicted cases, while it is certainly more relevant to block MET in cases of advanced neoplasia that exploit the activation of the invasive growth program to promote dissemination in other body parts. Few data are instead related to the role played by RON, a receptor homologous to MET. We have already demonstrated an implication of MET and RON genes in brain metastases from lung cancer. On this basis, the aim of this work is to recapitulate and dissect the molecular basis of metastatic brain dissemination from lung cancer. The latter is among the big killers and frequently gives rise to brain metastases, most often discovered at diagnosis. Molecular mechanisms leading to tumour spread to the brain are mostly unknown and in turn these tragic cases are still lacking effective therapies. Based on previously published data from our group, we aim to summarise and analyse the pathogenic mechanisms leading to activation of the scatter factor receptor in brain metastatic lesions of lung primaries, from the point of view of replacing the currently used empirical treatment with a more targeted approach.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Genetic and molecular profiling of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has led to the discovery of actionable oncogenic driver alterations, which has revolutionized treatment for this disease. This review will move beyond traditional mutational drivers such as EGFR and ALK and will instead focus on emerging targets and the efficacy of new precision therapies.; RECENT FINDINGS: Here, we discuss both established and emerging targeted therapy approaches, as well as ongoing challenges for the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring oncogenic alterations of the following types-gene fusions (ROS1, RET, NTRK), receptor tyrosine kinases (MET amplification and exon 14 mutations and EGFR/HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations), and MAPK signaling (SHP2 and altered BRAF and NF1). The treatment of lung cancer is increasingly biomarker-driven, as patients are selected for targeted agents based on the identification of genetic alterations amenable to inhibition. Our ability to further improve patient outcomes with this precision medicine approach will require continued efforts to identify, characterize, and target lesions driving lung cancer tumorigenesis and progression.

AB BACKGROUND: Information from historical infectious disease outbreaks provides real-world data about outbreaks and their impacts on affected populations. These data can be used to develop a picture of an unfolding outbreak in its early stages, when incoming information is sparse and isolated, to identify effective control measures and guide their implementation.; OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a publicly accessible Web-based visual analytic called Analytics for the Investigation of Disease Outbreaks (AIDO) that uses historical disease outbreak information for decision support and situational awareness of an unfolding outbreak.; METHODS: We developed an algorithm to allow the matching of unfolding outbreak data to a representative library of historical outbreaks. This process provides epidemiological clues that facilitate a user's understanding of an unfolding outbreak and facilitates informed decisions about mitigation actions. Disease-specific properties to build a complete picture of the unfolding event were identified through a data-driven approach. A method of analogs approach was used to develop a short-term forecasting feature in the analytic. The 4 major steps involved in developing this tool were (1) collection of historic outbreak data and preparation of the representative library, (2) development of AIDO algorithms, (3) development of user interface and associated visuals, and (4) verification and validation.; RESULTS: The tool currently includes representative historical outbreaks for 39 infectious diseases with over 600 diverse outbreaks. We identified 27 different properties categorized into 3 broad domains (population, location, and disease) that were used to evaluate outbreaks across all diseases for their effect on case count and duration of an outbreak. Statistical analyses revealed disease-specific properties from this set that were included in the disease-specific similarity algorithm. Although there were some similarities across diseases, we found that statistically important properties tend to vary, even between similar diseases. This may be because of our emphasis on including diverse representative outbreak presentations in our libraries. AIDO algorithm evaluations (similarity algorithm and short-term forecasting) were conducted using 4 case studies and we have shown details for the Q fever outbreak in Bilbao, Spain (2014), using data from the early stages of the outbreak. Using data from only the initial 2 weeks, AIDO identified historical outbreaks that were very similar in terms of their epidemiological picture (case count, duration, source of exposure, and urban setting). The short-term forecasting algorithm accurately predicted case count and duration for the unfolding outbreak.; CONCLUSIONS: AIDO is a decision support tool that facilitates increased situational awareness during an unfolding outbreak and enables informed decisions on mitigation strategies. AIDO analytics are available to epidemiologists across the globe with access to internet, at no cost. In this study, we presented a new approach to applying historical outbreak data to provide actionable information during the early stages of an unfolding infectious disease outbreak. ©Nileena Velappan, Ashlynn Rae Daughton, Geoffrey Fairchild, William Earl Rosenberger, Nicholas Generous, Maneesha Elizabeth Chitanvis, Forest Michael Altherr, Lauren A Castro, Reid Priedhorsky, Esteban Luis Abeyta, Leslie A Naranjo, Attelia Dawn Hollander, Grace Vuyisich, Antonietta Maria Lillo, Emily Kathryn Cloyd, Ashvini Rajendra Vaidya, Alina Deshpande.

AB Tailoring health-related materials is an effective mechanism to encourage behavior change; however, little research has described processes and critical characteristics for effective tailoring in underserved populations. The purpose of this study is to describe a process using input from content experts and lay patient advisors to tailor text messages focused on improving self-care behaviors of African-American adults with diabetes and identify characteristics of messages perceived to be most effective. An initial library of tailorable messages was created using theory-based approaches, expert opinion, and publicly available materials. A study-specific advisory council representing the program's intended population provided sequential individual and focus group review of a sample of draft messages focused on medication use, healthy eating, and physical activity. Messages were reviewed for content, tone, and applicability to African-American adults with diabetes from underserved communities. Based on this feedback, messages were revised and a final library of tailorable messages was constructed for use in a text messaging intervention. The initial library had over 5,000 tailorable messages. Participants preferred messages that included: (1) encouraging statements without condescension; (2) short sentences in lay language; (3) specific, actionable instructions; and (4) content relatable to daily activities of living. When possible, messages with similar themes should be repeated over short periods of time to improve the odds of material being absorbed and action being taken. Input from patient participants and advisors is essential for designing deeply tailored messages that honor the preferences, values, and norms of the population under study and promote health behavior change.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02957513. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2019.

AB PURPOSE: An estimated 10% of breast and ovarian cancers result from hereditary causes. Current testing guidelines for germ line susceptibility genes in patients with breast carcinoma were developed to identify carriers of BRCA1/ 2 variants and have evolved in the panel-testing era. We evaluated the capability of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to identify patients with breast cancer with pathogenic variants in expanded panel testing.; METHODS: An institutional review board-approved multicenter prospective registry was initiated with 20 community and academic sites experienced in cancer genetic testing and counseling. Eligibility criteria included patients with a previously or newly diagnosed breast cancer who had not undergone either single- or multigene testing. Consecutive patients 18 to 90 years of age were consented and underwent an 80-gene panel test. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant electronic case report forms collected information on patient demographics, diagnoses, phenotypes, and test results.; RESULTS: More than 1,000 patients were enrolled, and data records for 959 patients were analyzed; 49.95% met NCCN criteria, and 50.05% did not. Overall, 8.65% of patients had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. Of patients who met NCCN guidelines with test results, 9.39% had a P/LP variant. Of patients who did not meet guidelines, 7.9% had a P/LP variant. The difference in positive results between these groups was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test P = .4241).; CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that nearly half of patients with breast cancer with a P/LP variant with clinically actionable and/or management guidelines in development are missed by current testing guidelines. We recommend that all patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer undergo expanded panel testing.

AB Little is understood about the inpatient experience from the burn patients' perspectives. Rather, hospitals emphasize quantitative feedback as part of the ongoing process improvement. Comments returned with the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) administrative survey may provide important patient perspectives. They analyzed quantitative and qualitative HCAHPS data to identify areas for care improvement. They reviewed our burn center HCAHPS results over 2 years. They analyzed "top-box" result in each defined HCAHPS category, which is the most frequently reported best result in each composite, including survey scores ≥9 (out of 10). They performed qualitative content analysis of open-text responses via a HIPAA-compliant analysis software. They developed a hierarchy of major expressed themes and organized them using HCAHPS-validated satisfaction domains. A total of 610 inpatient HCAHPS surveys (21% response rate) were returned. Seventy-five percent of respondents ranked their burn center as ≥9 (out of 10) in care scores. Content analysis identified three main components of the inpatient experience: 1) provider/nurse communication, 2) hospital environment, and 3) the discharge experience. Caring, respect, handoff coordination, explanations, listening, and confidence in provider constituted the six key communication themes. Patients generally reported that burn providers listened to their concerns, but others requested clearer explanations of their condition and care. Responses about hospital environment highlighted excessive noise and disrupted sleep, and variable responses related to cleanliness. Challenges in the discharge experience included difficulties procuring wound care supplies and discharge medications. Qualitative data from HCAHPS helped identify major target areas for burn center performance improvement. Analysis of HCAHPS direct patient feedback is useful in process improvement, whereas numerical data alone do not provide sufficient actionable information. © American Burn Association 2018.

AB Liquid biopsy analytes such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) exhibit great potential for personalized treatment. Since cfDNA and CTCs are considered to give additive information and blood specimens are limited, isolation of cfDNA and CTC in an "all from one tube" format is desired. We investigated whether cfDNA variant sequencing from CTC-depleted blood (CTC-depl. B; obtained after positive immunomagnetic isolation of CTCs (AdnaTest EMT-2/Stem Cell Select, QIAGEN)) impacts the results compared to cfDNA variant sequencing from matched whole blood (WB). Cell-free DNA was isolated using matched WB and CTC-depl. B from 17 hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer patients (QIAamp MinElute ccfDNA Kit, QIAGEN). Cell-free DNA libraries were constructed (customized QIAseq Targeted DNA Panel for Illumina, QIAGEN) with integrated unique molecular indices. Sequencing (on the NextSeq 550 platform, Illumina) and data analysis (Ingenuity Variant Analysis) were performed. RNA expression in CTCs was analyzed by multimarker quantitative PCR. Cell-free DNA concentration and size distribution in the matched plasma samples were not significantly different. Seventy percent of all variants were identical in matched WB and CTC-depl. B, but 115/125 variants were exclusively found in WB/CTC-depl. B. The number of detected variants per patient and the number of exclusively detected variants per patient in only one cfDNA source did not differ between the two matched cfDNA sources. Even the characteristics of the exclusively detected cfDNA variants in either WB or CTC-depl. B were comparable. Thus, cfDNA variants from matched WB and CTC-depl. B exhibited no relevant differences, and parallel isolation of cfDNA and CTCs from only 10 mL of blood in an "all from one tube" format was feasible. Matched cfDNA mutational and CTC transcriptional analyses might empower a comprehensive liquid biopsy analysis to enhance the identification of actionable targets for individual therapy strategies.

AB Consumption of animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs in first-world countries has leveled off, but it is rising precipitously in developing countries. Agriculture will have to increase its output to meet demand, opening the door to increased automation and technological innovation; intensified, sustainable farming; and precision livestock farming (PLF) applications. Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors. Technologies providing accurate data can enhance a well-managed farm. Development of methods to turn the data into actionable solutions is critical.

AB PURPOSE: MET exon 14 splice site alterations that cause exon skipping at the mRNA level (METex14) are actionable oncogenic drivers amenable to therapy with MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI); however, secondary resistance eventually arises in most cases while other tumors display primary resistance. Beyond relatively uncommon on-target MET kinase domain mutations, mechanisms underlying primary and acquired resistance remain unclear.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined clinical and genomic data from 113 patients with lung cancer with METex14. MET TKI resistance due to KRAS mutation was functionally evaluated using in vivo and in vitro models.; RESULTS: Five of 113 patients (4.4%) with METex14 had concurrent KRAS G12 mutations, a rate of KRAS cooccurrence significantly higher than in other major driver-defined lung cancer subsets. In one patient, the KRAS mutation was acquired post-crizotinib, while the remaining 4 METex14 patients harbored the KRAS mutation prior to MET TKI therapy. Gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptomic data from lung cancers with METex14 revealed preferential activation of the KRAS pathway. Moreover, expression of oncogenic KRAS enhanced MET expression. Using isogenic and patient-derived models, we show that KRAS mutation results in constitutive activation of RAS/ERK signaling and resistance to MET inhibition. Dual inhibition of MET or EGFR/ERBB2 and MEK reduced growth of cell line and xenograft models.; CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutation is a recurrent mechanism of primary and secondary resistance to MET TKIs in METex14 lung cancers. Dual inhibition of MET or EGFR/ERBB2 and MEK may represent a potential therapeutic approach in this molecular cohort. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: We evaluated the clinical benefit of tumor molecular profiling to select treatment in the phase I setting.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid cancers and exhausted treatment options referred to a phase I unit were included in a prospective, single-center, single-arm open-label study (NCT02290522). Tumor biopsies were obtained for comprehensive genomic analysis including whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. When possible, patients were treated with regimen matched to the genomic profile. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).; RESULTS: From May 2013 to January 2017, a total of 591 patients were enrolled, with 500 patients undergoing biopsy. Genomic profiles were obtained in 460 patients and a potential actionable target was identified in 352 (70%) of 500 biopsied patients. A total of 101 patients (20%) received matched treatment based on either gene mutations or RNA expression levels of targets available in early clinical trials or off-label treatment. Objective response according to RECIST1.1 was observed in 15 of 101 patients (0% complete response, 15% partial response), with a median PFS of 12 weeks (95% confidence interval, 9.9-14.4).; CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the feasibility of genomic profiling to select patients in the phase I setting and suggests that genomic matching can be beneficial for a minor subset of patients with no other treatment options. Randomized studies may validate this assumption.See related commentary by Ratain, p. 1136. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Sex differences in glioma incidence and outcome have been previously reported but remain poorly understood. Many sex differences that affect the cancer risk were thought to be associated with cancer evolution.; METHODS: In this study, we used an integrated framework to infer the timing and clonal status of mutations in ~600 diffuse gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) including glioblastomas (GBMs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs), and investigated the sex difference of mutation clonality.; RESULTS: We observed higher overall and subclonal mutation burden in female patients with different grades of gliomas, which could be largely explained by the mutations of the X chromosome. Some well-established drivers were identified showing sex-biased clonality, such as CDH18 and ATRX. Focusing on glioma subtypes, we further found a higher subclonal mutation burden in females than males in the majority of glioma subtypes, and observed opposite clonal tendency of several drivers between male and female patients in a specific subtype. Moreover, analysis of clinically actionable genes revealed that mutations in genes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were more likely to be clonal in female patients with GBM, whereas mutations in genes involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway were more likely to be clonal in male patients with LGG.; CONCLUSIONS: The patients with diffuse glioma showed sex-biased mutation clonality (eg, different subclonal mutation number and different clonal tendency of cancer genes), highlighting the need to consider sex as an important variable for improving glioma therapy and clinical care. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to work with tribal communities to define and develop their own healthcare services and strategies for positive change regarding injection drug use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The secondary objective of this study was to incorporate community capacity building strategies to develop and sustain programming and resources to optimize tribal communities' responsiveness to reduce health disparities.; STUDY DESIGN: Semi-structured qualitative interviews.; METHODS: Interviews were guided by community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to create programs, projects, and policy recommendations meaningful to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people.; RESULTS: The study generated a formative understanding of the context of AI/AN people who inject drugs (PWID) in three distinct AI/AN communities as well as developed local capacity for future programming, projects, and policy.; CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms CBPR methods should be part of an iterative cycle to inform policy and programs. CBPR has helped strengthen local research capacity and has formed ongoing relationships between study investigators, local liaisons, and the community that will be essential for next phases of program design and policy implementation. This cycle of CBPR could be replicated in other tribal communities to bring awareness of the opioid epidemic and its effects and to prioritize local indigenous and community-led responses.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate an automated trigger algorithm designed to detect potentially adverse events in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), who were monitored remotely between visits. We embedded a trigger algorithm derived from parent-reported ADHD rating scales within an electronic patient monitoring system. We categorized clinicians' alert resolution outcomes and compared Vanderbilt ADHD rating scale scores between patients who did or did not have triggered alerts. A total of 146 out of 1738 parent reports (8%) triggered alerts for 98 patients. One hundred and eleven alerts (76%) required immediate clinician review. Nurses successfully contacted parents for 68 (61%) of actionable alerts; 46% (31/68) led to a change in care plan prior to the next scheduled appointment. Compared to patients without alerts, patients with alerts demonstrated worsened ADHD severity (beta = 5.8, 95% CI: 3.5⁻8.1 [p < 0.001] within 90 days prior to an alert. The trigger algorithm facilitated timely changes in the care plan in between face-to-face visits.

AB CLINICAL QUESTION: Do adults with atraumatic shoulder pain for more than 3 months diagnosed as subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS), also labelled as rotator cuff disease, benefit from subacromial decompression surgery? This guideline builds on to two recent high quality trials of shoulder surgery.; CURRENT PRACTICE: SAPS is the common diagnosis for shoulder pain with several first line treatment options, including analgesia, exercises, and injections. Surgeons frequently perform arthroscopic subacromial decompression for prolonged symptoms, with guidelines providing conflicting recommendations.; RECOMMENDATION: The guideline panel makes a strong recommendation against surgery.; HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines and the GRADE system. The recommendation is based on two linked systematic reviews on (a) the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery and (b) the minimally important differences for patient reported outcome measures. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of surgery in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (www.magicapp.org) to support shared decisions and adaptation.; THE EVIDENCE: Surgery did not provide important improvements in pain, function, or quality of life compared with placebo surgery or other options. Frozen shoulder may be more common with surgery.; UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: The panel concluded that almost all informed patients would choose to avoid surgery because there is no benefit but there are harms and it is burdensome. Subacromial decompression surgery should not be offered to patients with SAPS. However, there is substantial uncertainty in what alternative treatment is best.

AB Whole exome sequencing (WES), targeted gene panel sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are increasingly used for the identification of actionable alterations that are critical to cancer care. Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor.

AB Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene remain a hallmark of human cancer. In addition to mutation of TP53, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene can have a profound impact on p53 function, and can affect cancer risk as well as other p53 functions. Wild type (WT) p53 contains a proline at amino acid 47, but approximately 1% of African-Americans express a p53 allele with a serine at amino acid 47 (Pro47Ser, hereafter S47). In a mouse model for this variant, mice expressing S47 are predisposed to spontaneous cancers. The S47 variant also is associated with increased pre-menopausal breast cancer risk in African American women. We recently reported that S47 tumor cells are resistant to the majority of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, but show increased sensitivity to a subset of anti-cancer agents, compared to tumors with WT p53. In this work, we report on another potentially promising therapeutic vulnerability of S47 tumors. We find that S47 tumors show decreased mitochondrial metabolism, along with increased dependency on glycolysis. S47 tumor cells also show increased sensitivity to the glycolytic poison 2-deoxy-glucose. We propose that the altered metabolism in S47 tumor cells may be yet another potentially-actionable therapeutic vulnerability to exploit in cancer-prone individuals with this genotype.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is capable of sequencing millions or billions of DNA molecules simultaneously. Therefore, it represents a promising tool for the analysis of molecular targets for the initial diagnosis of disease, monitoring of disease progression, and identifying the mechanism of drug resistance. On behalf of the Tumor Biomarker Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) and the China Actionable Genome Consortium (CAGC), the present expert group hereby proposes advisory guidelines on clinical applications of NGS technology for the analysis of cancer driver genes for precision cancer therapy. This group comprises an assembly of laboratory cancer geneticists, clinical oncologists, bioinformaticians, pathologists, and other professionals. After multiple rounds of discussions and revisions, the expert group has reached a preliminary consensus on the need of NGS in clinical diagnosis, its regulation, and compliance standards in clinical sample collection. Moreover, it has prepared NGS criteria, the sequencing standard operation procedure (SOP), data analysis, report, and NGS platform certification and validation.

AB We use a three-component replicator system with healthy cells, sensitive cells, and resistant cells, with a prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix from evolutionary game theory, to model and control the nonlinear dynamical system governing the ecological mechanism of competitive release by which tumors develop chemotherapeutic resistance. The control method we describe is based on nonlinear trajectory design and energy transfer methods first introduced in the orbital mechanics literature for Hamiltonian systems. For continuous therapy, the basin boundaries of attraction associated with the chemo-sensitive population and the chemo-resistant population for increasing values of chemo-concentrations have an intertwined spiral structure with extreme sensitivity to changes in chemo-concentration level as well as sensitivity with respect to resistant mutations. For time-dependent therapies, we introduce an orbit transfer method to construct continuous families of periodic (closed) orbits by switching the chemo-dose at carefully chosen times and appropriate levels to design schedules that are superior to both maximum tolerated dose (MTD) schedules and low-dose metronomic (LDM) schedules, both of which ultimately lead to fixation of sensitive cells or resistant cells. By keeping the three subpopulations of cells in competition with each other indefinitely, we avoid fixation of the cancer cell population and regrowth of a resistant tumor. The method can be viewed as a way to dynamically shape the average population fitness landscape of a tumor to steer the chemotherapeutic response curve. We show that the method is remarkably insensitive to initial conditions and small changes in chemo-dosages, an important criterion for turning the method into an actionable strategy.

AB OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children <15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.; PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.; KEY ACTION STATEMENTS: The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥1 of the following: temperature >38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.; DIFFERENCES FROM PRIOR GUIDELINE: (1)Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2)There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3)Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4)Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5)Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6)Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7)Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: Existing research regarding design improvements to the operating room (OR) is scarce and emphasizes the compelling need to measure and test new design strategies and interventions.; METHODS: We propose a conceptual framework for measuring and improving OR physical space design by outlining how two existing measurement schemes can be adapted for ORs. The structure, process, outcomes model described by Donabedian in 1966 is used to show how each of these three measurement approaches can be used to evaluate OR design. In addition, we describe a common design framework that focuses on the end-user experience to highlight the impact different OR stakeholders can have on the prioritization of improvements.; RESULTS: The structure, process, outcomes model has both benefits and drawbacks for measuring OR design quality. For example, these components are easy to measure, highly actionable when deficient, and have high validity as the bottom line. However, they may not necessarily reflect better quality or correlate to better care, and some need risk adjustment to make comparisons fair. The end-user experience model should account for the needs of patients, OR nurses, anesthesiologists, surgeons, facilities managers, hospital administrators, infection control officers, and regulators, among others.; CONCLUSION: The design quality of ORs influences outcomes and determines the quality of experience for multiple stakeholders. Patients, providers, and hospital staff would benefit directly from efforts to improve OR physical space design. By adapting previously established frameworks, it is possible to measure, evaluate, and improve OR design.

AB In human breast cancer, both circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood and disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow are predictive of short survival and may be used as liquid biopsy to guide therapy. Herein we investigate, for the first time, the feasibility to quantify CTCs and DTCs in canine metastatic mammary carcinoma (MMC) with the automated CellSearch platform, which identifies tumour cells by immune-magnetic enrichment and fluorescent labelling. Using this approach before start of treatment, we could detect at least 1 CTC per 7.5 mL of peripheral blood in 12 out of 27 evaluable samples (44.4%) and at least 1 DTC per 1 mL of bone marrow in 11 out of 14 evaluable samples (78.6%). Conversely, we did not find any CTCs in the healthy, negative control dogs (n = 5) that we analysed in parallel. Interestingly, the levels of CTCs/DTCs and the prevalence of positive dogs closely resemble results obtained by CellSearch assay in metastatic breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Moreover, in the canine cohort, the presence of CTCs was significantly associated with poor outcome. These observations identify the first actionable marker in veterinarian oncology to guide treatment of canine MMC. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for human research, since it reinforce the value of canine MMC as model useful to speed up pharmacological studies with primary endpoint of overall survival, given the reduced life-span of the canine species.

AB In Japan, the National Cancer Center and university hospitals have initiated next-generation sequencing-based in vitro diagnostic testing for cancer patients as a method of clinical sequencing. Based on the molecular alterations detected, physicians can provide approved targeted therapy and access to investigational drugs for cancer patients. However, interpretation of the clinical significance of genomic alterations remains the most severe bottleneck of precision medicine in cancer. Although many research institutes in the United States are developing knowledge bases for interpretation of the tumor alterations and clinical decisions, these knowledge bases are unsuited as sources of reference in Japan due to differences in the information on approved drugs and implementation of clinical trials. In this review, we introduce knowledge bases for clinical decision-making based on genomic events in cancer, and discuss the resources of additional information necessary for implementing precision medicine in Japan.

AB In the field of cancer genomics, the broad availability of genetic information offered by next-generation sequencing technologies and rapid growth in biomedical publication has led to the advent of the big-data era. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to tackle the challenges of scalability and high dimensionality of data and to transform big data into clinically actionable knowledge is expanding and becoming the foundation of precision medicine. In this paper, we review the current status and future directions of AI application in cancer genomics within the context of workflows to integrate genomic analysis for precision cancer care. The existing solutions of AI and their limitations in cancer genetic testing and diagnostics such as variant calling and interpretation are critically analyzed. Publicly available tools or algorithms for key NLP technologies in the literature mining for evidence-based clinical recommendations are reviewed and compared. In addition, the present paper highlights the challenges to AI adoption in digital healthcare with regard to data requirements, algorithmic transparency, reproducibility, and real-world assessment, and discusses the importance of preparing patients and physicians for modern digitized healthcare. We believe that AI will remain the main driver to healthcare transformation toward precision medicine, yet the unprecedented challenges posed should be addressed to ensure safety and beneficial impact to healthcare.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease, the pathogenesis of which is influenced by genetic and epigenetic events. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is extracellular DNA that is present in a number of bodily fluids, including blood, synovial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid. Compared with performing a tissue biopsy, ctDNA examination presents the advantages of minimal invasion and greater convenience. ctDNA is commonly used to identify actionable genomic alterations, monitor treatment responses, unravel therapeutic resistance and potentially detect disease progression prior to clinical and radiological confirmation. The technique can potentially serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool in personalized medicine, as it demonstrates prognostic value in the management of patients with CRC. ctDNA detection continues to demonstrate inherent advantages compared with other methods, thus serving an increasingly important role in tumor monitoring and oncotherapy. The aim of the current review was to explore the clinical applications of ctDNA in patients with CRC, including early detection and screening, medication guidance, resistance prediction, and residual lesion and recurrence monitoring. Furthermore, several technical methods for ctDNA detection and analysis are explored, as well as other potential biomarkers.

AB The field of hereditary kidney cancer has begun to mature following the identification of several germline syndromes that define genetic and molecular features of this cancer. Molecular defects within these hereditary syndromes demonstrate consistent deficits in angiogenesis and metabolic signaling, largely driven by altered hypoxia signaling. The classical mutation, loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, provides a human pathogenesis model for critical aspects of pseudohypoxia. These features are mimicked in a less common hereditary renal tumor syndrome, known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma. Here, we review renal tumor angiogenesis and metabolism from a HIF-centric perspective, considering alterations in the hypoxic landscape, and molecular deviations resulting from high levels of HIF family members. Mutations underlying HIF deregulation drive multifactorial aberrations in angiogenic signals and metabolism. The mechanisms by which these defects drive tumor growth are still emerging. However, the distinctive patterns of angiogenesis and glycolysis-/glutamine-dependent bioenergetics provide insight into the cellular environment of these cancers. The result is a scenario permissive for aggressive tumorigenesis especially within the proximal renal tubule. These features of tumorigenesis have been highly actionable in kidney cancer treatments, and will likely continue as central tenets of kidney cancer therapeutics.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular subtyping of cancer aimed to predict patient overall survival (OS) and nominate drug targets for patient treatments is central to precision oncology. Owing to the rapid development of phosphoproteomics, we can now measure thousands of phosphoproteins in human cancer tissues. However, limited studies report how to analyse the complex phosphoproteomic data for cancer subtyping and to nominate druggable kinase candidates.; FINDINGS: In this work, we reanalysed the phosphoproteomic data of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Our analysis classified HGSOC into 5 major subtypes that were associated with different OS and appeared to be more accurate than that achieved with protein profiling. We provided a workflow to identify 29 kinases whose increased activities in tumours are associated with poor survival. The altered kinase signalling landscape of HGSOC included the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, cell cycle and MAP kinase signalling pathways. We also developed a "patient-specific" hierarchy of clinically actionable kinases and selected kinase inhibitors by considering kinase activation and kinase inhibitor selectivity.; INTERPRETATION: Our study offered a global phosphoproteomics data analysis workflow to aid in cancer molecular subtyping, determining phosphorylation-based cancer hallmarks and facilitating nomination of kinase inhibition in cancer.

AB Precision medicine can be defined as the customization of medical treatment based on the individual genetic profile, which enables one to identify patients who respond to therapies while sparing side effects for those who do not. Breast cancer patients have been treated based on subtyping, which is considered a prototype of precision medicine. Furthermore, the development of multigene panel testing has resulted in a paradigm shift in the treatment of breast cancer. The knowledge generated from the Human Genome Project, and subsequently The Cancer Genome Atlas, has provided the concept of precision medicine, in which cancer patients can be sub-classified based on actionable driver mutations that can be selectively targeted by molecular targeted drugs and treated by appropriate molecular targeted therapies. Development of next-generation sequencing has both dramatically advanced genomic sequencing technology and revealed actionable driver mutations for individual cancer patients when applied to a clinical setting. Clinical target sequencing by next-generation sequencing enables one to formulate treatment strategies, not only by selecting a subgroup of patients who are expected to experience more effectiveness of each drug, but also by revealing patients with drug resistance based on their actionable driver mutations.

AB Importance: Numerous studies have demonstrated that long-term outcomes after orthopedic trauma are associated with psychosocial and behavioral health factors evident early in the patient's recovery. Little is known about how to identify clinically actionable subgroups within this population.; Objectives: To examine whether risk and protective factors measured at 6 weeks after injury could classify individuals into risk clusters and evaluate whether these clusters explain variations in 12-month outcomes.; Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective observational study was conducted between July 16, 2013, and January 15, 2016, among 352 patients with severe orthopedic injuries at 6 US level I trauma centers. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 9, 2017, to July 13, 2018.; Main Outcomes and Measures: At 6 weeks after discharge, patients completed standardized measures for 5 risk factors (pain intensity, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse, and tobacco use) and 4 protective factors (resilience, social support, self-efficacy for return to usual activity, and self-efficacy for managing the financial demands of recovery). Latent class analysis was used to classify participants into clusters, which were evaluated against measures of function, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and self-rated health collected at 12 months.; Results: Among the 352 patients (121 women and 231 men; mean [SD] age, 37.6 [12.5] years), latent class analysis identified 6 distinct patient clusters as the optimal solution. For clinical use, these clusters can be collapsed into 4 groups, sorted from low risk and high protection (best) to high risk and low protection (worst). All outcomes worsened across the 4 clinical groupings. Bayesian analysis shows that the mean Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment dysfunction scores at 12 months differed by 7.8 points (95% CI, 3.0-12.6) between the best and second groups, by 10.3 points (95% CI, 1.6-20.2) between the second and third groups, and by 18.4 points (95% CI, 7.7-28.0) between the third and worst groups.; Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrates that during early recovery, patients with orthopedic trauma can be classified into risk and protective clusters that account for a substantial amount of the variance in 12-month functional and health outcomes. Early screening and classification may allow a personalized approach to postsurgical care that conserves resources and targets appropriate levels of care to more patients.

AB Background: Application of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has recently become increasingly common in the field of clinical oncology in several countries around the world. In Japan also, a system for applying NGS to routine clinical practice is gradually being established. During this process, we introduced in Japan the tumor-profiling MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) assay.; Methods: We present here our initial experience with the use of MSK-IMPACT in 68 patients selected from two institutions in Japan between June 2016 and October 2017.; Results: MSK-IMPACT sequencing was successful and yielded results in specimens obtained from 64 of the 68 patients, representing an overall assay success rate of 94.1%. The top three cancer types tested were endometrial cancer (17.2%), pancreatic cancer (15.6%) and colorectal cancer (12.5%). Evaluation of the clinical actionability of the genetic alterations revealed that 25.0% of patients (n = 16) harbored at least one actionable alteration. However, enrolling the patients in a genomically matched clinical trial was difficult, mainly because most clinical trials are limited to tumors arising from a specific organ/site. One patient with microsatellite instability-high status, as determined by MSK-IMPACT, was treated with pembrolizumab and showed partial response.; Conclusions: Although tumor profiling by NGS and administration of genomically matched therapy is a promising strategy, because of its high cost, we need to consider how we can fit it into the Japanese medical system. Towards this end, we believe that it is important to share our initial experience for furthering precision medicine in Japan.

AB The aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling is a leading cause of the development of medulloblastoma, a pediatric tumor of the cerebellum. The FDA‑approved HH inhibitor, Vismodegib, which targets the transmembrane transducer SMO, has shown limited efficacy in patients with medulloblastoma, due to compensatory mechanisms that maintain an active HH‑GLI signaling status. Thus, the identification of novel actionable mechanisms, directly affecting the activity of the HH‑regulated GLI transcription factors is an important goal for these malignancies. In this study, using gene expression and reporter assays, combined with biochemical and cellular analyses, we demonstrate that mitogen‑activated kinase kinase kinase1(MEKK1), the most upstream kinase of the mitogen‑activated protein kinase(MAPK) phosphorylation modules, suppresses HH signaling by associating and phosphorylating GLI1, the most potent HH‑regulated transcription factor. Phosphorylation occurred at multiple residues in the C‑terminal region of GLI1 and was followed by an increased association with the cytoplasmic proteins14‑3‑3. Of note, the enforced expression of MEKK1 or the exposure of medulloblastoma cells to the MEKK1 activator, Nocodazole, resulted in a marked inhibitory effect on GLI1 activity and tumor cell proliferation and viability. Taken together, the results of this study shed light on a novel regulatory mechanism of HH signaling, with potentially relevant implications in cancer therapy.

AB PURPOSE: To report our experience with 2 cases of Capnocytophaga keratitis.; METHODS: This is a retrospective study of case reports. We present the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment strategies of 2 patients who presented with Capnocytophaga keratitis.; RESULTS: Both patients had risk factors including systemic immune compromise and ocular trauma. Both patients had robust inflammatory keratitis with necrosis. Case 1 demonstrates identification of Capnocytophaga with traditional microbiologic techniques. Case 2 demonstrates the use of unbiased metagenomic deep sequencing for identification of this unusual corneal pathogen.; CONCLUSIONS: Capnocytophaga is a rare and aggressive infection. Even when traditional culture identifies the pathogen rapidly, keratitis can progress to perforation. In cases of severe keratitis in which traditional culture methods are unrevealing, metagenomic deep sequencing has potential to provide actionable diagnoses.

AB Inherited genetic variations in pharmacogenetic loci are widely acknowledged as important determinants of phenotypic differences in drug response, and may be actionable in the clinic. However, recent studies suggest that a considerable number of novel rare variants in pharmacogenes likely contribute to a still unexplained fraction of the observed interindividual variability. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a rapid, relatively inexpensive, large-scale DNA sequencing technology with potential relevance as a comprehensive pharmacogenetic genotyping platform to identify genetic variation related to drug therapy. However, many obstacles remain before the clinical use of NGS-based test results, including technical challenges, functional interpretation, and strict requirements for diagnostic tests. Advanced computational analyses, high-throughput screening methodologies, and generation of shared resources with cell-based and clinical information will facilitate the integration of NGS data into candidate genotyping approaches, likely enhancing future drug phenotype predictions in patients.

AB BACKGROUND: While most pediatric sarcomas respond to front-line therapy, some bone sarcomas do not show radiographic response like soft-tissue sarcomas (rhabdomyosarccomas) but do show 90% necrosis. Though, new therapies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life in pediatric patients with sarcomas. Complex chromosomal aberrations such as amplifications and deletions of DNA sequences are frequently observed in pediatric sarcomas. Evaluation of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with pediatric sarcoma patients at the time of diagnosis or following therapy offers an opportunity to assess dysregulated molecular targets and signaling pathways that may drive sarcoma development, progression, or relapse. The objective of this study was to utilize publicly available data sets to identify potential predictive biomarkers of chemotherapeutic response in pediatric Osteosarcoma (OS), Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFTs) based on CNVs following chemotherapy (OS n=117, RMS n=64, ESFTs n=25 tumor biopsies).; METHODS: There were 206 CNV profiles derived from pediatric sarcoma biopsies collected from the public databases TARGET and NCBI-Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Through our comparative genomic analyses of OS, RMS, and ESFTs and 22,255 healthy individuals called from the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we identified CNVs (amplifications and deletions) pattern of genomic instability in these pediatric sarcomas. By integrating CNVs of Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) identified in the pool of genes with drug-response data from sarcoma cell lines (n=27) from Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) Version 2, potential predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response were identified.; RESULTS: Genes associated with survival and/recurrence of these sarcomas with statistical significance were found on long arm of chromosome 8 and smaller aberrations were also identified at chromosomes 1q, 12q and x in OS, RMS, and ESFTs. A pool of 63 genes that harbored amplifications and/or deletions were frequently associated with recurrence across OS, RMS, and ESFTs. Correlation analysis of CNVs from CCLE with drug-response data of CTRP in 27 sarcoma cell lines, 33 CNVs out of 63 genes correlated with either sensitivity or resistance to 17 chemotherapies from which actionable CNV signatures such as IGF1R, MYC, MAPK1, ATF1, and MDM2 were identified. These CNV signatures could potentially be used to delineate patient populations that will respond versus those that will not respond to a particular chemotherapy.; CONCLUSIONS: The large-scale analyses of CNV-drug screening provides a platform to evaluate genetic alterations across aggressive pediatric sarcomas. Additionally, this study provides novel insights into the potential utilization of CNVs as not only prognostic but also as predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response. Information obtained in this study may help guide and prioritize patient-specific therapeutic options in pediatric bone and soft-tissue sarcomas.

AB Background: The concept of personalized medicine defines a promising approach in cancer care. High-throughput genomic profiling of tumor specimens allows the identification of actionable mutations that potentially lead to tailored treatment for individuals' benefit. The aim of this study was to prove efficacy of a personalized treatment option in solid tumor patients after failure of standard treatment concepts.; Results: Final analysis demonstrates that 34 patients (62%) had a longer PFS upon experimental treatment (PFS1) when compared to previous therapy (PFS0); PFS ratio > 1.0 (p = 0.002). The median PFS under targeted therapy based on molecular profiling (PFS1) was 112 days (quartiles 66/201) and PFS0 = 61 days (quartiles 51/92; p = 0.002). Of the 55 patients, 31 (56%) showed disease control (DCR), consisting of 2 (4%) patients which achieved a complete remission, 14 (25%) patients with a partial remission and 15 (27%) patients who had a stabilization of disease. Median OS from start of experimental therapy was 348 days (quartiles 177/664).; Conclusion: The prospective trial EXACT suggests that treatment based on real-time molecular tumor profiling leads to superior clinical benefit.; Materials and Methods: In this prospective clinical phase II trial, 55 cancer patients, after failure of standard treatment options, aimed to achieve a longer progression-free survival on the experimental treatment based on the individual's molecular profile (PFS1) when compared to the last treatment given before (PFS0). The personalized medicine approach was conceived to be clinical beneficial for patients who show a PFS ratio (PFS 1/PFS0) of > 1.0.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the understandability, actionability, and readability of online diabetes education materials.; SUMMARY: This was a descriptive study that identified printable diabetes education materials through an online search. Materials were included from the following sources: national organizations with materials approved by expert panels, corporations with materials subject to FDA approval, and not-for-profit organizations with inter-professional advisory boards to approve materials. Topics included were basic knowledge of diabetes, hypoglycemia, insulin, and blood sugar goals. Materials were excluded if they were non-printable, contained active links, had a publication date prior to January 2011, were greater than 2 pages in length, or were pediatric focused. Understandability and actionability of the patient education materials were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Descriptive statistics and inter-rater reliability analysis using the kappa statistic were utilized. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) formula. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between reading grade level and PEMAT scores. In total, 25 websites were identified, 5 of which met the inclusion criteria; 13 patient education materials were included, PEMAT scoring revealed that 4 of these met the criteria for understandability and only 1 met the criteria for actionability. There was no correlation found between PEMAT scores and reading grade levels (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.30, p = 0.325).; CONCLUSION: The majority of diabetes patient education materials reviewed scored poorly using the PEMAT. Future development of diabetes patient education materials should be designed with the goal of increasing understandability and actionability. © American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

AB This editorial highlights submissions to part II of the 3rd IBCN Seminars Series particularly focusing on the tools required for conduction of translational research in bladder cancer. One of the submissions describe the ex vivo culture of primary tumor cells from N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced bladder tumors in rats and subsequent establishment of an immortalized cell line. In a next step the authors thoroughly characterize this cell line. They conclude that differentiation marker expression patterns observed in the original tumors are largely retained in the spheroids. Although new cancer models, such as organoid tissue cultures, hold great promise for studying cancer progression and might have a potential for development and selection of an optimal treatment, their limitations must be kept in mind. The second submission, therefore, critically questions the current role of organoid tissue culture as a predictive tool in urothelial cancer patients. The third manuscript of this series provides a broader overview of post-translational modification in bladder cancer is presented and how PTMs can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets. The 3 manuscripts featured in this issue demonstrate especially how basic research is being channeled to inform clinically actionable discoveries. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Progress in health service quality is vital to reach the target of Universal Health Coverage. However, in order to improve quality, it must be measured, and the assessment results must be actionable. We analyzed an electronic tool, which was developed to assess and monitor the quality of primary healthcare in Tanzania in the context of routine supportive supervision. The electronic assessment tool focused on areas in which improvements are most effective in order to suit its purpose of routinely steering improvement measures at local level.; METHODS: Due to the lack of standards regarding how to best measure quality of care, we used a range of different quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the appropriateness of the quality assessment tool. The quantitative methods included descriptive statistics, linear regression models, and factor analysis; the qualitative methods in-depth interviews and observations.; RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative results were overlapping and consistent. Robustness checks confirmed the tool's ability to assign scores to health facilities and revealed the usefulness of grouping indicators into different quality dimensions. Focusing the quality assessment on processes and structural adequacy of healthcare was an appropriate approach for the assessment's intended purpose, and a unique key feature of the electronic assessment tool. The findings underpinned the accuracy of the assessment tool to measure and monitor quality of primary healthcare for the purpose of routinely steering improvement measures at local level. This was true for different level and owner categories of primary healthcare facilities in Tanzania.; CONCLUSION: The electronic assessment tool demonstrated a feasible option for routine quality measures of primary healthcare in Tanzania. The findings, combined with the more operational results of companion papers, created a solid foundation for an approach that could lastingly improve services for patients attending primary healthcare. However, the results also revealed that the use of the electronic assessment tool outside its intended purpose, for example for performance-based payment schemes, accreditation and other systematic evaluations of healthcare quality, should be considered carefully because of the risk of bias, adverse effects and corruption.

AB Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation is an actionable mutation in lung adenocarcinoma. Nonetheless tumour consists of heterogeneous cell subpopulations with diverse phenotypes and genotypes, and cancer cells can actively release extracellular vesicles (EVs) to modulate the phenotype of other cells in the tumour microenvironment. We hypothesized that EVs derived from a drug-resistant subpopulation of cells could induce drug resistance in recipient cells. We have established ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and subclones. The subclones have been characterized and the expression of EV-RNAs determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of EV transfer on drug resistance were examined in vitro. Serum EV-RNA was assayed serially in two patients prescribed ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI) treatment. We demonstrated that the EVs from an ALK-TKI-resistant subclone could induce drug resistance in the originally sensitive subclone. EV-RNA profiling revealed that miRNAs miR-21-5p and miR-486-3p, and lncRNAs MEG3 and XIST were differentially expressed in the EVs secreted by the resistant subclones. These circulating EV-RNA levels have been found to correlate with disease progression of EML4-ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma in patients prescribed ALK-TKI treatment. The results from this study suggest that EVs released by a drug-resistant subpopulation can induce drug resistance in other subpopulations and may sustain intratumoural heterogeneity.

AB Recent advances in radiological imaging and genomic analysis are profoundly changing the way to manage lung cancer patients. Screening programs which couple lung cancer risk prediction models and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) recently showed their effectiveness in the early diagnosis of lung tumors. In addition, the emerging field of radiomics is revolutionizing the approach to handle medical images, i.e., from a "simple" visual inspection to a high-throughput analysis of hundreds of quantitative features of images which can predict prognosis and therapy response. Yet, with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the establishment of large genomic consortia, the whole mutational and transcriptomic profile of lung cancer has been unveiled and made publicly available via web services interfaces. This has tremendously accelerated the discovery of actionable mutations, as well as the identification of cancer biomarkers, which are pivotal for development of personalized targeted therapies. In this review, we will describe recent advances in cancer biomarkers discovery for early diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of chemotherapy response.

AB Background: Few studies have evaluated the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with meningiomas. Here, we report the largest prospective, longitudinal cross-sectional cohort study of HRQoL in meningiomas to date, in order to identify possible actionable determinants of global HRQoL.; Methods: Adults who had undergone resection of a grade I intracranial meningioma and were in routine follow-up at a single large tertiary center underwent HRQoL assessment using the QLQ-C30 questionnaire administered opportunistically at follow-up visits. Averaged transformed QLQ-C30 scores at 12-month intervals were compared with scores from a normative reference population, with reference to known minimal clinically meaningful difference (CMD) in scores. To evaluate for possible determinants of changes in global HRQoL, global HRQoL scores were correlated (Spearman's Rho) with subdomain and symptom scores and with interval time from surgical resection.; Results: A total of 291 postoperative patients with histologically confirmed and surgically treated grade I meningiomas consented to participation and a total of 455 questionnaires were included for analysis. Patients with meningiomas reported reduced global HRQoL at nearly every 12-month interval with clinically and statistically significant impairments at 12, 48, 108, and 120 months postoperative compared with the normative population (P < 0.05). Meningioma patients at the 12-month interval also reported a reduction of each subdomain of HRQoL assessment (P < 0.05); however, a CMD was only seen in cognitive functioning. Physical, emotional, cognitive, and social subdomains, as well as fatigue and sleep/insomnia, were significantly associated with global HRQoL at the first 12-month interval. Overall, there was no significant correlation between time from surgery and global HRQoL or the subdomain functional or symptom sections of the QLQ-C30.; Conclusions: Meningioma patients report considerable limitations in HRQoL for more than 120 months after surgery, particularly in cognitive, emotional, and social function, as well as suffering significant fatigue and sleep impairment compared with a normative reference population. The majority of these reported functional impairments and symptoms are strongly associated with global HRQoL and thus can be considered determinants of global HRQoL that if treated, have the potential to improve HRQoL for our meningioma patients. This hypothesis requires future study of targeted interventions to determine their efficacy.

AB The last two decades have provided an astounding amount of novel information about the human genome. Translating germline genomic data into clinically actionable findings is reliant on the annotation and laboratory classification of specific variants. Variant classification helps providers and patients determine if genomic findings can inform clinical management. In germline hereditary cancer predisposition testing, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are routinely misunderstood. By definition, they cannot be classified by the testing laboratory as either problematic mutations or benign variants. Many VUS undergo category reclassifications over time (from months to years after initial classification) as more information is known about normal human genomic diversity, especially among underrepresented minority populations. When VUS are reclassified, it has been shown that they are often downgraded. Likewise, some variants originally thought to be actionable mutations are downgraded to VUS or benign variants. Rarely but importantly, VUS may be reclassified in a manner that increases their initial clinical significance. Here, we discuss the insights gained from the study of variant reclassification. We provide a case series to highlight the potential impact that variant reclassifications can have on individual and family cancer management, risk counseling, and screening.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a core set of capabilities and tasks for local health departments (LHDs) to engage in land use and transportation policy processes that promote active transportation.; DESIGN: We conducted a 3-phase modified Delphi study from 2015 to 2017.; SETTING: We recruited a multidisciplinary national expert panel for key informant interviews by telephone and completion of a 2-step online validation process.; PARTICIPANTS: The panel consisted of 58 individuals with expertise in local transportation and policy processes, as well as experience in cross-sector collaboration with public health. Participants represented the disciplines of land use planning, transportation/public works, public health, municipal administration, and active transportation advocacy at the state and local levels.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Key informant interviews elicited initial capabilities and tasks. An online survey solicited rankings of impact and feasibility for capabilities and ratings of importance for associated tasks. Feasibility rankings were used to categorize capabilities according to required resources. Results were presented via second online survey for final input.; RESULTS: Ten capabilities were categorized according to required resources. Fewest resources were as follows: (1) collaborate with public officials; (2) serve on land use or transportation board; and (3) review plans, policies, and projects. Moderate resources were as follows: (4) outreach to the community; (5) educate policy makers; (6) participate in plan and policy development; and (7) participate in project development and design review. Most resources were as follows: (8) participate in data and assessment activities; (9) fund dedicated staffing; and (10) provide funding support.; CONCLUSIONS: These actionable capabilities can guide planning efforts for LHDs of all resource levels.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

AB Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant health care burden. Immune-mediated adverse drug reactions (IM-ADRs) are responsible for one-fifth of ADRs but contribute a disproportionately high amount of that burden due to their severity. Variation in human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) genes has emerged as a potential preprescription screening strategy for the prevention of previously unpredictable IM-ADRs. Immunopharmacogenomics combines the disciplines of immunogenomics and pharmacogenomics and focuses on the effects of immune-specific variation on drug disposition and IM-ADRs. In this review, we present the latest evidence for HLA associations with IM-ADRs, ongoing research into biological mechanisms of IM-ADRs, and the translation of clinical actionable biomarkers for IM-ADRs, with a focus on T cell-mediated ADRs.

AB The primary purpose of this study is to determine if the implementation of an actionable findings communication system (PeerVue) with explicitly defined criteria for the classification of critical results, leads to an increase in the number of actionable findings reported by radiologists. Secondary goals are to 1) analyze the adoption rate of PeerVue and 2) assess the accuracy of the classification of actionable findings within this system. Over a two-year period, 890,204 radiology reports were analyzed retrospectively in order to identify the number of actionable findings communicated before (Year 1) and after the implementation of PeerVue (Year 2) at a tertiary care academic medical center. A sub-sample of 145 actionable findings over a two-month period in Year 2 was further analyzed to assess the degree of concordance with our reporting policy. Before PeerVue, 4623/423,070 (1.09%) of radiology reports contained an actionable finding. After its implementation, this number increased to 6825/467,134 (1.46%) (p<0.0001). PeerVue was used in 3886/6825 (56.9%) cases with actionable findings. The remaining 2939/6825 (43.1%) were reported using the legacy tagging system. From the sub-sample taken from PeerVue, 104/145 (71.7%) were consistent with the updated reporting policy. A software program (PeerVue) utilized for the communication of actionable findings contributed to a 34% (p<0.0001) increase in the reporting rate of actionable findings. A sub-analysis within the new system indicated a 56.9% adoption rate and a 71.7% accuracy rate in reporting of actionable findings.

AB The post-graduate medical programs at Queen's University transitioned to a competency-based medical education framework on July 1, 2017. In advance of this transition, the Medical Oncology program participated in a pilot of six Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) focused workplace-based assessment (WBA) tools with faculty and residents. The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed method study was to determine the extent to which these WBAs provided quality feedback for residents. The WBAs were introduced into daily clinical practice and, once completed, were collected by the research team. A resident focus group (n=4) and faculty interviews (n=5) were also conducted. Focus group and interview data were analyzed using an emergent thematic analysis. Data from the completed assessment tools were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and a literature-informed framework developed to assess the quality of feedback. Six main findings emerged: Verbal feedback is preferred over written; providing both written and verbal feedback is important; effective feedback was seen as timely, specific, and actionable; the process was conceptualized as coaching rather than high stakes; there were logistical concerns about the WBAs, and additional clarification about the WBA tools is needed. This study provides insight into faculty and resident perceptions of quality feedback and the potential for WBA tools to assist in providing effective feedback to residents as we shift to competency-based medical education in Canada. Our results suggest the need for additional faculty development around the use of the tools, and their intended role, and the elements of quality feedback.

AB Alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) is one of the several hallmarks of cancer. Genomic instability resulting from a disrupted DDR mechanism is known to contribute to cancer progression, and are subjected to radiation, cytotoxic, or more recently targeted therapies with limited success. Synthetic lethality (SL), which is a condition where simultaneous loss-of-function of the genes from complementary pathways result in loss of viability of cancer cells have been exploited to treat malignancies resulting from defects in certain DDR pathways. Albeit being a promising therapeutic strategy, number of SL based drugs currently in clinical trial is limited. In this work we performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of alterations in 10 DDR pathways with different components of DNA repair. Using unsupervised clustering of single sample enrichment of these pathways in 7,272 tumor samples from 17 tumor types from TCGA, we identified three prominent clusters, each associated with specific DDR mechanisms. Somatic mutations in key DDR genes were found to be dominant in each of these three clusters with distinct DDR component. Using a machine-learning based algorithm we predicted SL partners specific to somatic mutations in key genes representing each of the three DDR clusters and identified potential druggable targets. We explored the potential FDA-approved drugs for targeting the predicted SL genes and tested the sensitivity using the drug screening data in cell lines with mutation in the primary DDR genes. We have shown clinical relevance, for selected targetable SL interactions using Kaplan-Meier analysis in terms of improved disease-free survival. Thus, our computational framework provides a basis for clinically relevant and actionable SL based drug targets specific to alterations in DDR pathways.

AB Respiration rate is an important vital sign that can provide insight into a patient's status and health progression. This information is used from critical care to sports and human performance evaluation. The current state of the art has demonstrated effectiveness in monitoring respiration rate with the use of wearable sensors. However, their form factor, which refers to the embodiment of approach, size, and shape, makes it difficult to implement within a longterm monitoring setting. Problems relating to form factor, such as compliance, are a major issue in collecting useful and actionable data, because they directly impact comfort and ease of wear. We present a new approach based on an optical computer mouse sensor that can be rendered into a slim, wearable device without the need for a harness or shirt to hold the sensor in place. Its main objective is to achieve similar or better readings than those of the state of the art while reducing the overall size and thus, improve compliance by making it easier, more comfortable to wear. The principle of operation of the sensor allows for enhanced signal and computational noise reduction for movement artifacts. The sensor was tested to determine its limits of detection and was calibrated to expected distance of movement. Then, observations were made under normal breathing conditions, apnea, deep breathing, and hyperventilation covering a spectrum of 0 to 45 breathings per minute (BPM). The performance of the device was described by using the mean average error which was 0.37 and 0.83 under deep breathing and hyperventilation, respectively. Testing revealed that the device produces the best results when worn over the diaphragm and that its readings are comparable to the industry gold standard. The future version we are developing incorporates a slimmer, lighter design, Bluetooth data communication to remove leads and wires, adhesive electrodes and a reusable adhesive that is also waterproof.

AB The identification and characterization of pharmacogenetic variants in Latin American populations is still an ongoing endeavor. Here, we investigated SNVs on genes listed by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base in 1284 Mestizos and 94 Natives from Mexico. Five institutional cohorts with NGS data were retrieved from different research projects at INMEGEN, sequencing files were filtered for 55 pharmacogenes present in all cohorts to identify novel and known variation. Bioinformatic tools VEP, PROVEAN, and FATHMM were used to assess, in silico, the functional impact of this variation. Next, we focused on 17 genes with actionable variants that have been clinically implemented. Allele frequencies were compared with major continental groups and differences discussed in the scope of a pharmacogenomic impact. We observed a wide genetic variability for known and novel SNVs, the largest variation was on UGT1A > ACE > COMT > ABCB1 and the lowest on APOE and NAT2. Although with allele frequencies around 1%, novel variation was observed in 16 of 17 PGKB genes. In Natives we identified 59 variants and 58 in Mestizos. Several genes did not show novel variation, on CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in Natives; and APOE, UGT1A, and VKORC1 in Mestizos. Similarities in allele frequency, comparing major continental groups for VIP pharmacogenes, hint towards a comparable PGx for drugs metabolized by UGT1A1, DPYD, ABCB1, CBR3, COMT, and TPMT; in contrast to variants on CYP3A5 and CYP2B6 for which significant MAF differences were identified. Our observations offer some discernment into the extent of pharmacogenetic variation registered up-to-date in Mexicans and contribute to quantitatively dissect actionable pharmacogenetic variants in Natives and Mestizos.

AB Background: Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare RASopathy causing developmental delays, short stature and classically, delayed puberty. We present a patient with CS and central precocious puberty (CPP).; Case presentation: A female patient with CS presented at 6years 10months of age with breast development. CPP was biochemically confirmed at 7years 1month of age, no additional pituitary dysfunction was noted and puberty progressed at follow-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a Chiari I malformation with a syrinx, requiring surgical decompression. The patient was successfully treated with histrelin.; Conclusions: Although recent publications do not recommend routine brain MRI in girls with isolated CPP over 6years of age, in those with CS actionable MRI findings are more likely and imaging should be performed. It is unclear whether the cerebral malformation in the patient contributed to CPP or was an incidental syndromic finding. © The Author(s). 2019.

AB PURPOSE: Very high-risk prostate cancer (PC) is associated with poor response to local and systemic treatments; however, few cases have been molecularly profiled. We studied clinical outcomes and molecular profiles of patients with clinically localized primary Gleason pattern 5 PC.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinicopathologic features, targeted somatic and germline sequencing, and PTEN, TP53, and ERG status by immunohistochemistry were assessed in patients undergoing surgery from 2005 to 2015; 60 consecutive patients were identified with Gleason score 5 + 4 = 9 or 5 + 5 = 10 PC after radical prostatectomy with available tissue and clinical follow-up. Clinicopathologic and genomic parameters were correlated with biochemical relapse, metastasis-free survival, time to castration resistance, and overall survival using Cox proportional hazards models.; RESULTS: Of patients with somatic sequencing data and clinical follow-up, 34% had DNA repair gene mutations, including 22% (11 of 49) with homologous recombination and 12% (six of 49) with mismatch repair gene alterations. Homologous recombination mutations were germline in 82% (nine of 11) of patients. In addition, 33% (16 of 49) had TP53 mutation, and 51% (29 of 57) had PTEN loss. Overall, 43% developed metastasis, with a time to castration resistance of 12 months. On multivariable analysis of clinicopathologic variables, only ductal/intraductal histology (hazard ratio, 4.43; 95% CI, 1.76 to 11.15; P = .002) and seminal vesicle invasion (hazard ratio, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.83 to 14.47; P = .002) were associated with metastasis. Among genomic alterations, only TP53 mutation and PTEN loss were associated with metastasis on univariable analysis, and neither remained significant in multivariable analyses. These data are retrospective and hypothesis generating.; CONCLUSION: Potentially actionable homologous recombination and mismatch repair alterations are observed in a significant proportion of patients with very high-risk PC at the time of radical prostatectomy. These findings could inform the design of prospective trials in this patient population.

AB Background: We previously reported that in pathogenic mismatch repair (path_MMR) variant carriers, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) was not reduced when colonoscopy was undertaken more frequently than once every 3 years, and that CRC stage and interval since last colonoscopy were not correlated.; Methods: The Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD) that records outcomes of surveillance was examined to determine survival after colon cancer in relation to the time since previous colonoscopy and pathological stage. Only path_MMR variants scored by the InSiGHT variant database as class 4 or 5 (clinically actionable) were included in the analysis.; Results: Ninety-nine path_MMR carriers had no cancer prior to or at first colonoscopy, but subsequently developed colon cancer. Among these, 96 were 65years of age or younger at diagnosis, and included 77 path_MLH1, 17 path_MSH2, and 2 path_MSH6 carriers. The number of cancers detected within <1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5 and at >3.5years after previous colonoscopy were 9, 43, 31 and 13, respectively. Of these, 2, 8, 4 and 3 were stage III, respectively, and only one stage IV (interval 2.5-3.5years) disease. Ten-year crude survival after colon cancer were 93, 94 and 82% for stage I, II and III disease, respectively (p<0.001). Ten-year crude survival when the last colonoscopy had been <1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5 or>3.5years before diagnosis, was 89, 90, 90 and 92%, respectively (p=0.91).; Conclusions: In path_MLH1 and path_MSH2 carriers, more advanced colon cancer stage was associated with poorer survival, whereas time since previous colonoscopy was not. Although the numbers are limited, together with our previously reported findings, these results may be in conflict with the view that follow-up of path_MMR variant carriers with colonoscopy intervals of less than 3years provides significant benefit. © The Author(s). 2019.

AB Lung cancers and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have some of the worst 5-year survival rates of all cancer types, primarily due to a lack of effective treatment options for most patients. Targeted therapies have shown some promise in thoracic cancers, although efficacy is limited only to patients harboring specific mutations or target expression. Although a number of actionable mutations have now been identified, a large population of thoracic cancer patients have no therapeutic options outside of first-line chemotherapy. It is therefore crucial to identify alternative targets that might lead to the development of new ways of treating patients diagnosed with these diseases. The multifunctional oncoprotein Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) could serve as one such target. Recent studies also link this protein to many inherent behaviors of thoracic cancer cells such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis and involvement in cancer stem-like cells. Here, we review the regulation of YB-1 at the transcriptional, translational, post-translational and sub-cellular levels in thoracic cancer and discuss its potential use as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

AB Understanding the drivers of research on human genes is a critical component to success of translation efforts of genomics into medicine and public health. Using publicly available curated online databases we sought to identify specific genes that are featured in translational genetic research in comparison to all genomics research publications. Articles in the CDC's Public Health Genomics and Precision Health Knowledge Base were stratified into studies that have moved beyond basic research to population and clinical epidemiologic studies (T1: clinical and population human genome epidemiology research), and studies that evaluate, implement, and assess impact of genes in clinical and public health areas (T2+: beyond bench to bedside). We examined gene counts and numbers of publications within these phases of translation in comparison to all genes from Medline. We are able to highlight those genes that are moving from basic research to clinical and public health translational research, namely in cancer and a few genetic diseases with high penetrance and clinical actionability. Identifying human genes of translational value is an important step towards determining an evidence-based trajectory of the human genome in clinical and public health practice over time. © This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply 2019.

AB The decreasing cost of and increasing capacity of DNA sequencing has led to vastly increased opportunities for population-level genomic studies to discover novel genomic alterations associated with both Mendelian and complex phenotypes. To translate genomic findings clinically, a number of health care institutions have worked collaboratively or individually to initiate precision medicine programs. These precision medicine programs involve designing patient enrollment systems, tracking electronic health records, building biobank repositories, and returning results with actionable matched therapies. As cancer is a paradigm for genetic diseases and new therapies are increasingly tailored to attack genetic susceptibilities in tumors, these precision medicine programs are largely driven by the urgent need to perform genetic profiling on cancer patients in real time. Here, we review the current landscape of precision oncology and highlight challenges to be overcome and examples of benefits to patients. Furthermore, we make suggestions to optimize future precision oncology programs based upon the lessons learned from these "first generation" early adopters. © 2019 Yang et al.

AB Phage Display is a powerful method for the identification of peptide binding to targets of variable complexities and tissues, from unique molecules to the internal surfaces of vessels of living organisms. Particularly for in vivo screenings, the resulting repertoires can be very complex and difficult to study with traditional approaches. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) opened the possibility to acquire high resolution overviews of such repertoires and thus facilitates the identification of binders of interest. Additionally, the ever-increasing amount of available genome/proteome information became satisfactory regarding the identification of putative mimicked proteins, due to the large scale on which partial sequence homology is assessed. However, the subsequent production of massive data stresses the need for high-performance computational approaches in order to perform standardized and insightful molecular network analysis. Systems-level analysis is essential for efficient resolution of the underlying molecular complexity and the extraction of actionable interpretation, in terms of systemic biological processes and pathways that are systematically perturbed. In this work we introduce PepSimili, an integrated workflow tool, which performs mapping of massive peptide repertoires on whole proteomes and delivers a streamlined, systems-level biological interpretation. The tool employs modules for modeling and filtering of background noise due to random mappings and amplifies the biologically meaningful signal through coupling with BioInfoMiner, a systems interpretation tool that employs graph-theoretic methods for prioritization of systemic processes and corresponding driver genes. The current implementation exploits the Galaxy environment and is available online. A case study using public data is presented, with and without a control selection.

AB PURPOSE: We developed a precision medicine program for patients with advanced cancer using integrative whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifteen patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors were prospectively enrolled, and paired tumor/normal sequencing was performed. Seven hundred fifty-nine tumors from 515 patients were evaluated.; RESULTS: Most frequent tumor types were prostate (19.4%), brain (16.5%), bladder (15.4%), and kidney cancer (9.2%). Most frequently altered genes were TP53 (33%), CDKN2A (11%), APC (10%), KTM2D (8%), PTEN (8%), and BRCA2 (8%). Pathogenic germline alterations were present in 10.7% of patients, most frequently CHEK2 (1.9%), BRCA1 (1.5%), BRCA2 (1.5%), and MSH6 (1.4%). Novel gene fusions were identified, including a RBM47-CDK12 fusion in a metastatic prostate cancer sample. The rate of clinically relevant alterations was 39% by whole-exome sequencing, which was improved by 16% by adding RNA sequencing. In patients with more than one sequenced tumor sample (n = 146), 84.62% of actionable mutations were concordant.; CONCLUSION: Integrative analysis may uncover informative alterations for an advanced pan-cancer patient population. These alterations are consistent in spatially and temporally heterogeneous samples.

AB BACKGROUND: Personalized medicine requires accurate molecular profiling for targeted therapy decisions. Insufficient tissue yield or tumor heterogeneity frequently limits the correct tissue biomarker determination. As a noninvasive complement to traditional tissue biopsies, liquid biopsies detect and track cancer driver mutations from biofluids (e.g., blood, urine). Here we present the analytical validation of Target Selector ctDNA assays capable of single mutant DNA copy detection.; METHODS: The Target Selector ctDNA assay applies a patented Switch-Blocker technology to suppress amplification of background (wild-type) WT alleles, while allowing specific amplification of very low frequency mutant alleles. In contrast to allele specific enrichment technologies like ddPCR, one Switch-Blocker inhibits amplification of a DNA target up to 15 bp in length (e.g., one Switch-Blocker covers all KRAS exon 2, codon 12 and 13 variants). Target enrichment is achieved through a quantitative PCR reaction; subsequent DNA sequencing confirms mutation identity. Analytical validation with cancer cell line DNA was conducted by three independent operators using five instruments across five days.; RESULTS: A total of 3086 samples were tested on EGFR, BRAF and KRAS Target Selector ctDNA assays, with EGFR WT as a reference. All assays showed >99% analytical sensitivity and specificity. Single mutant copy detection is confirmed by experimental data and theoretical estimates. In the presence of 14000 WT DNA copies, limits of detection were: EGFR Del19, 0.01%; EGFR L858R, 0.02%; EGFR T790M, 0.01%; BRAF V600E, 0.01%; KRAS G12C, 0.02%. Inter- and intra-assay analyses showed r2>0.94, suggesting consistent performance among operational variables. Healthy donor samples (100 tests) showed clinical specificity at >99%. Finally, Target Selector clinical experience data of >2200 patient samples is consistent with published tissue mutation prevalence.; CONCLUSIONS: Highly sensitive Target Selector ctDNA assays with single mutant copy detection and limit of detection at 0.02% or better enable accurate molecular profiling vital for disease management.

AB Precision medicine is a type of medical care designed to optimize the therapeutic efficiency or benefit for particular groups of patients with the use of genetic profiling. The application of precision medicine in cancer treatment is prospected because cancer is reported to be the leading cause of death in Japan. Consequently, Japanese cancer genome medicine will be launched within this fiscal year. In this study, we focus on precision medicine specifically in the field of hematological malignancies with an overview of its clinical utility. We further discuss how precision medicine should be developed in this field, based on our experience of a feasibility study for clinical sequencing in hematological malignancies.

AB High-performing primary health care (PHC) is essential for achieving universal health coverage. However, in many countries, PHC is weak and unable to deliver on its potential. Improvement is often limited by a lack of actionable data to inform policies and set priorities. To address this gap, the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) was formed to strengthen measurement of PHC in low-income and middle-income countries in order to accelerate improvement. PHCPI's Vital Signs Profile was designed to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the performance of a country's PHC system, yet quantitative information about PHC systems' capacity to deliver high-quality, effective care was limited by the scarcity of existing data sources and metrics. To systematically measure the capacity of PHC systems, PHCPI developed the PHC Progression Model, a rubric-based mixed-methods assessment tool. The PHC Progression Model is completed through a participatory process by in-country teams and subsequently reviewed by PHCPI to validate results and ensure consistency across countries. In 2018, PHCPI partnered with five countries to pilot the tool and found that it was feasible to implement with fidelity, produced valid results, and was highly acceptable and useful to stakeholders. Pilot results showed that both the participatory assessment process and resulting findings yielded novel and actionable insights into PHC strengths and weaknesses. Based on these positive early results, PHCPI will support expansion of the PHC Progression Model to additional countries to systematically and comprehensively measure PHC system capacity in order to identify and prioritise targeted improvement efforts. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB Molecular analyses of the vaginal microbiota have uncovered a vast array of organisms in this niche, but not so far changed what has been known for a long time: lactobacilli are dominant in health, and the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is sub-optimal, and has not changed for over 40 years. While the lowering cost of DNA sequencing has attracted more researchers to the field, and bioinformatics, and statistical tools have made it possible to produce large datasets, it is functional and actionable studies that are more urgently needed, not more microbial abundance, and health or disease-associative data. The triggers of dysbiosis remain to be identified, but ultimately treatment will require disrupting biofilms of primarily anaerobic bacteria and replacing them with the host's own lactobacilli, or health-promoting organisms. The options of using probiotic strains to displace the biofilms and for prebiotics to encourage resurgence of the indigenous lactobacilli hold great promise, but more researchers need to develop, and test these concepts in humans. The enormity of the problem of vaginal dysbiosis cannot be understated. It should not take another 40 years to offer better management options. Copyright © 2019 Reid.

AB In this review, we present the main large-scale experimental studies that have been performed in the HIV/AIDS field. These "omics" studies are based on several technologies including genotyping, RNA interference, and transcriptome or epigenome analysis. Due to the direct connection with disease evolution, there has been a large focus on genotyping cohorts of well-characterized patients through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but there have also been several invitro studies such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) interference or transcriptome analyses of HIV-1-infected cells. After describing the major results obtained with these omics technologies-including some with a high relevance for HIV-1 treatment-we discuss the next steps that the community needs to embrace in order to derive new actionable therapeutic or diagnostic targets. Only integrative approaches that combine all big data results and consider their complex interactions will allow us to capture the global picture of HIV molecular pathogenesis. This novel challenge will require large collaborative efforts and represents a huge open field for innovative bioinformatics approaches. Copyright © 2019 Le Clerc, Limou and Zagury.

AB Designed to improve health, today numerous wearables and smartphone apps are used by millions across the world. Yet the wealth of data generated from the many sensors on these wearables and smartwatches has not yet transformed routine clinical care. One central reason for this gap between data and clinical insights is the lack of transparency and standards around data generated from mobile device that hinders interoperability and reproducibility. The clinical informatics community has offered solutions via the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard which facilities electronic health record interoperability but is less developed towards precision temporal contextually-tagged sensor measurements generated from today's ubiquitous mobile devices. In this paper we explore the opportunities and challenges of various theoretical approaches towards FHIR compatible digital phenotyping, and offer a concrete example implementing one such framework as an Application Programming Interface (API) for the open-source mindLAMP platform. We aim to build a community with contributions from statisticians, clinicians, patients, family members, researchers, designers, engineers, and more.

AB Recent studies imply a key role of endothelin-1 receptor (ET-1R), belonging to the largest family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), in the regulation of a plethora of processes involved in tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. beta-arrestin-1 (beta-arr1) system has been recognized as a critical hub controlling GPCR signaling network, directing the GPCR's biological outcomes. In ovarian cancer, ET-1R/beta-arr1 axis enables cancer cells to engage several integrated signaling, and represents an actionable target for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Preclinical research studies demonstrate that ET-1R blockade by the approved dual ETAR/ETBR antagonist macitentan counteracts beta-arr1-mediated signaling network, and hampers the dialogue among cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, interfering with metastatic progression and drug response. In light of major developments in the ET-1R signaling paradigm, this review article discusses the emerging evidence of the dual ET-1R antagonist treatment in cancer, and outlines our challenge in preclinical studies warranting the repurposing of ET-1R antagonists for the design of more effective clinical trials based on combinatorial therapies to overcome, or prevent, the onset of drug resistance.

AB Tumors driven by mutant KRAS are among the most aggressive and refractory to treatment. Unfortunately, despite the efforts, targeting alterations of this GTPase, either directly or by acting on the downstream signaling cascades, has been, so far, largely unsuccessful. However, recently, novel therapeutic opportunities are emerging based on the effect that this oncogenic lesion exerts in rewiring the cancer cell metabolism. Cancer cells that become dependent on KRAS-driven metabolic adaptations are sensitive to the inhibition of these metabolic routes, revealing novel therapeutic windows of intervention. In general, mutant KRAS fosters tumor growth by shifting cancer cell metabolism toward anabolic pathways. Depending on the tumor, KRAS-driven metabolic rewiring occurs by up-regulating rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid, fatty acid, or nucleotide biosynthesis, and by stimulating scavenging pathways such as macropinocytosis and autophagy, which, in turn, provide building blocks to the anabolic routes, also maintaining the energy levels and the cell redox potential (1). This review will discuss the most recent findings on mutant KRAS metabolic reliance in tumor models of pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer, also highlighting the role that these metabolic adaptations play in resistance to target therapy. The effects of constitutive KRAS activation in glycolysis elevation, amino acids metabolism reprogramming, fatty acid turnover, and nucleotide biosynthesis will be discussed also in the context of different genetic landscapes.

AB The current dominant models of intervention design in the development sector do not account for the complexity and unpredictability of implementation challenges. Decision makers and implementers need timely feedback during implementation to respond to field realities and to course-correct. This letter calls for a new approach of "responsive feedback" or "feedback loops" that promotes interactions between project designers, implementers, researchers and decision-makers to enable course corrections needed to achieve intended outcomes. A responsive feedback approach, in theory, should be agile, flexible, adaptive, iterative, and actionable. There can be multiple challenges associated with incorporating this approach into practice including donor requirements, organizational structure and culture, concerns about the additional time required to adopt such an approach, resource and operational constraints, the absence of skill sets needed for such an approach within smaller organizations and inadequate inter-departmental communication. However, these barriers to adaptation can be overcome. For responsive feedback to become a part of the culture of development organizations, commitment is needed from donors, decision-makers, project designers and implementers. We believe that, to generate opportunities for learning and adaptation, donors should provide the stimulus to break down silos between implementers and researchers.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pharmacogenomics is about selecting the "right drug in the right amount for the right patient." In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent. We aimed to report on the feasibility and the results of incorporating pharmacogenomics testing into clinical practice.; METHODS: As a quality improvement initiative and a center of individualized medicine grant, we integrated the use of OneOme RightMed comprehensive test, which reports on 27 genes related to pharmacogenomics and over 300 medications of interest. We limited initial testing to patients with colorectal cancer. Pharmacists provided dosage recommendations based on test results in real-time.; RESULTS: At our cancer center, 155 patients underwent pharmacogenomics testing from November 2017 to January 2019. Results were available within 3 to 5 days of testing for most patients and were integrated into treatment decision-making. Of 155 sampled participants, a total of 89 (57.4%) participants had an UGT1A1 variant genotype, NM_000463.2: c.-53_-52[8] *1/*28, n = 74 (47.7%); *28/*28, n = 15 (9.7%). Additionally, 4 (2.6%) participants were heterozygous for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Two (1.3%) individuals were heterozygous for both UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase genes. All (100%) the patients had at least 1 actionable aberration related to supportive care medications (CYP-family) of all the possible medications listed on their pharmacogenomics report.; CONCLUSION: Preemptive comprehensive pharmacogenomics testing can be integrated into clinical practice in real-time for patients with cancer given faster turnaround and low cost. Pharmacist-driven, patient-specific medication management consults add further value given the number of genes/drugs. This sets the stage for a prospective randomized clinical trial to demonstrate the amount of benefit this can result in these patients.

AB PURPOSE: Tumor-only genomic profiling (TGP) is increasingly advocated for all patients with cancer given the possible therapeutic implications. It is critical to develop clinical algorithms to identify and address potentially actionable germline findings identified by TGP.; METHODS: A multidisciplinary team analyzed publicly available data for genes in which mutations are implicated in germline cancer susceptibility and established a pipeline to automate clinical referral for evaluation of TGP findings.; RESULTS: A total of 2,308 patients underwent TGP, with 81 patients (3.5%) identified by the automatic referral pipeline; 37 patients (1.6%) were referred outside the pipeline based on concerns by the molecular geneticist, pathologist, or oncologist regarding genotype-phenotype correlation. Thirty-one patients (38%) and 17 patients (46%) underwent germline testing from the automatic pipeline and other referrals, respectively, and of these patients, 23 (72%) and four (24%) had confirmed germline pathogenic variants (GPVs), respectively. The majority of confirmed GPVs were in automatic referral genes, with BRCA2 being most common (confirmed GPVs in 11 [85%] of 13 patients tested), followed by PALB2 (five [67%] of six patients), BRCA1 (two [40%] of five patients), MSH6 (two of three patients), and MLH1 (two of two patients). Forty-eight percent of confirmed GPVs were found in tumors known to be associated with germline mutations in the gene. Germline testing was not performed in 50 (62%) of 81 patients identified by automatic referral as a result of poor patient health or death (30%), lack of follow-up (30%), and patient refusal (30%).; CONCLUSION: Of patients undergoing TGP, 5% had somatic findings triggering referral, and implementation of an automatic referral pipeline based solely on gene versus other clinical or molecular features resulted in a 74% germline confirmation. However, only 41% of referred patients underwent germline testing. Systems-based approaches are needed to identify carriers of actionable germline cancer susceptibility mutations identified by TGP.

AB The use of data generated passively by personal electronic devices, such as smartphones, to measure human function in health and disease has generated significant research interest. Particularly in psychiatry, objective, continuous quantitation using patients' own devices may result in clinically useful markers that can be used to refine diagnostic processes, tailor treatment choices, improve condition monitoring for actionable outcomes, such as early signs of relapse, and develop new intervention models. If a principal goal for digital phenotyping is clinical improvement, research needs to attend now to factors that will help or hinder future clinical adoption. We identify four opportunities for research directed toward this goal: exploring intermediate outcomes and underlying disease mechanisms; focusing on purposes that are likely to be used in clinical practice; anticipating quality and safety barriers to adoption; and exploring the potential for digital personalized medicine arising from the integration of digital phenotyping and digital interventions. Clinical relevance also means explicitly addressing consumer needs, preferences, and acceptability as the ultimate users of digital phenotyping interventions. There is a risk that, without such considerations, the potential benefits of digital phenotyping are delayed or not realized because approaches that are feasible for application in healthcare, and the evidence required to support clinical commissioning, are not developed. Practical steps to accelerate this research agenda include the further development of digital phenotyping technology platforms focusing on scalability and equity, establishing shared data repositories and common data standards, and fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between clinical stakeholders (including patients), computer scientists, and researchers.

AB Gallbladder cancer is an aggressive cancer that continues to be an important health care issue in certain regions of the world such as Southeast Asia and Latin America. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced, unresectable stage and systemic therapy is their only option. Gallbladder cancer patients have traditionally been included in clinical trials for biliary tract cancer. Thus, systemic chemotherapy options for this cancer are similar to those for cholangiocarcinoma, including gemcitabine and cisplatin in the first line and FOLFOX in the second-line setting. Ongoing phase III clinical trials may change the systemic therapy paradigm for this cancer. Molecular profiling has indicated important genetic differences between gallbladder cancer and cholangio-carcinoma, which affects choice of targeted therapy. Her2/neu amplification, PIK3CA mutations and DNA repair genetic aberrations are relatively frequent and represent actionable targets for this cancer.

AB Foodborne diseases (FBDs) are infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by foodborne pathogens (FBPs) such as bacteria [Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)] and several viruses, but also parasites and some fungi. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its sub-discipline machine learning (ML) are re-emerging and gaining an ever increasing popularity in the scientific community and industry, and could lead to actionable knowledge in diverse ranges of sectors including epidemiological investigations of FBD outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As genotyping using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming more accessible and affordable, it is increasingly used as a routine tool for the detection of pathogens, and has the potential to differentiate between outbreak strains that are closely related, identify virulence/resistance genes and provide improved understanding of transmission events within hours to days. In most cases, the computational pipeline of WGS data analysis can be divided into four (though, not necessarily consecutive) major steps: de novo genome assembly, genome characterization, comparative genomics, and inference of phylogeny or phylogenomics. In each step, ML could be used to increase the speed and potentially the accuracy (provided increasing amounts of high-quality input data) of identification of the source of ongoing outbreaks, leading to more efficient treatment and prevention of additional cases. In this review, we explore whether ML or any other form of AI algorithms have already been proposed for the respective tasks and compare those with mechanistic model-based approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: Human cancer cell lines are fundamental models for cancer research and therapeutic strategy development. However, there is no characterization of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in a large number of cancer cell lines.; METHODS: Here, we apply four circRNA identification algorithms to heuristically characterize the expression landscape of circRNAs across ~1000 human cancer cell lines from CCLE polyA-enriched RNA-seq data. By using integrative analysis and experimental approaches, we explore the expression landscape, biogenesis, functional consequences, and drug response of circRNAs across different cancer lineages.; RESULTS: We revealed highly lineage-specific expression patterns of circRNAs, suggesting that circRNAs may be powerful diagnostic and/or prognostic markers in cancer treatment. We also identified key genes involved in circRNA biogenesis and confirmed that TGF-beta signaling may promote biogenesis of circRNAs. Strikingly, we showed that clinically actionable genes are more likely to generate circRNAs, potentially due to the enrichment of RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites. Among these, circMYC can promote cell proliferation. We observed strong association between the expression of circRNAs and the response to drugs, especially those targeting chromatin histone acetylation. Finally, we developed a user-friendly data portal, CircRNAs in cancer cell lines (CircRiC, https://hanlab.uth.edu/cRic ), to benefit the biomedical research community.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the characterization of circRNAs in cancer cell lines and explored the potential mechanism of circRNA biogenesis as well as its therapeutic implications. We also provide a data portal to facilitate the related biomedical researches.

AB Cholangiocarcinoma is a heterogeneous and target-rich disease with differences in actionable targets. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic types of cholangiocarcinoma differ significantly in clinical presentation and underlying genetic aberrations. Research has shown that extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is more likely to be associated with ERBB2 (HER2) genetic aberrations. Various anti-HER2 clinical trials, case reports and other molecular studies show that HER2 is a real target in cholangiocarcinoma; however, anti-HER2 agents are still not approved for routine administration. Here, we show in a metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with ERBB2 amplification identified on liquid biopsy (circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing), a dramatic response to now over 12 months of dual-anti-HER2 therapy. We also summarize the current literature on anti-HER2 therapy for cholangiocarcinoma. This would likely become another treatment option for this target-rich disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Incidental and secondary findings (IFs and SFs) are subject to ongoing discussion as potential consequences of clinical exome sequencing (ES). International policy documents vary on the reporting of these findings. Discussion points include the practice of unintentionally identified IFs versus deliberately pursued SFs, patient opt-out possibilities and the spectrum of reportable findings. The heterogeneity of advice permits a non-standardised disclosure but research is lacking on actual reporting practices. Therefore, this study assessed national reporting practices for IFs and SFs in clinical ES and the underlying professional perspectives.; METHODS: A qualitative focus group study has been undertaken, including professionals from Belgian centres for medical genetics (CMGs). Data were analysed thematically.; RESULTS: All Belgian CMGs participated in this study. Data analysis resulted in six main themes, including one regarding the reporting criteria used for IFs. All CMGs currently use ES-based panel testing. They have limited experience with IFs in clinical ES and are cautious about the pursuit of SFs. Two main reporting criteria for IFs were referred to by all CMGs: the clinical significance of the IF (including pathogenicity and medical actionability) and patient-related factors (including the patient's preference to know and patient characteristics). The consensus over the importance of these criteria contrasted with their challenging interpretation and application. Points of concern included IFs' pathogenicity in non-symptomatic persons, IFs concerning variants of uncertain significance, the requirement and definition of medical actionability and patient opt-out possibilities. Finally, reporting decisions were guided by the interaction between the clinical significance of the IF and patient characteristics. This interaction questions the possible disclosure of findings with context-dependent and personal utility, such as IFs concerning a carrier status. To evaluate the IF's final relevance, a professional and case-by-case deliberation was considered essential.; CONCLUSIONS: The challenging application of reporting criteria for IFs results in diversified practices and policy perspectives within Belgian CMGs. This echoes international concerns and may have consequences for effective policy recommendations.

AB Background: High-throughput genomic profiling of tumour specimens facilitates the identification of individual actionable mutations which could be used for individualised targeted therapy. This approach is becoming increasingly more common in the clinic; however, the interpretation of results from molecular profiling tests and efficient guiding of molecular therapies to patients with advanced cancer offer a significant challenge to the oncology community.; Experimental design: MONDTI is a precision medicine platform for molecular characterisation of metastatic solid tumours to identify actionable genomic alterations. From 2013 to 2016, comprehensive molecular profiles derived from real-time biopsy specimens and archived tumour tissue samples of 295 patients were performed. Results and treatment suggestions were discussed within multidisciplinary tumour board meetings.; Results: The mutational profile was obtained from 293 (99%) patients and a complete immunohistochemical (IHC) and cytogenetic profile was obtained in 181 (61%) and 188 (64%) patients. The most frequent cancer types were colorectal cancer (12%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (9.8%) and head and neck cancers (7.8%). The most commonly detected mutations were TP53 (39%), KRAS (19%) and PIK3CA (9.5%), whereas ≥1 mutation were identified in 217 (74%) samples. Regarding the results for IHC testing, samples were positive for phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (phospho-mTOR) (71%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (68%), mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) (56%) and/or platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRalpha)-expression (48%). Of the 288 tumour samples with one or more genetic alteration detected, 160 (55.6%) targeted therapy recommendations through 67 multidisciplinary tumour board meetings were made; in 69 (24%) cases, an individual treatment concept was initiated.; Conclusions: The results reveal that the open concept for all solid tumours characterised for molecular profile and immunotherapy could not only match individualised treatment concepts at a high rate but also underscores the challenges encountered when offering molecularly matched therapies to a patient population with an advanced stage cancer.

AB Genomic and epidemiological monitoring have become an integral part of our response to emerging and ongoing epidemics of viral infectious diseases. Advances in high-throughput sequencing, including portable genomic sequencing at reduced costs and turnaround time, are paralleled by continuing developments in methodology to infer evolutionary histories (dynamics/patterns) and to identify factors driving viral spread in space and time. The traditionally static nature of visualizing phylogenetic trees that represent these evolutionary relationships/processes has also evolved, albeit perhaps at a slower rate. Advanced visualization tools with increased resolution assist in drawing conclusions from phylogenetic estimates and may even have potential to better inform public health and treatment decisions, but the design (and choice of what analyses are shown) is hindered by the complexity of information embedded within current phylogenetic models and the integration of available meta-data. In this review, we discuss visualization challenges for the interpretation and exploration of reconstructed histories of viral epidemics that arose from increasing volumes of sequence data and the wealth of additional data layers that can be integrated. We focus on solutions that address joint temporal and spatial visualization but also consider what the future may bring in terms of visualization and how this may become of value for the coming era of real-time digital pathogen surveillance, where actionable results and adequate intervention strategies need to be obtained within days.

AB There is a need to investigate and better understand the inherited risk of cancer to ensure that clinical applications provide more accurate assessments and management strategies. Developing research-based next-generation sequencing gene panels that not only target (present-day) clinically actionable susceptibility genes but also genes that currently lack sufficient evidence for risk as well as candidate genes, such as those in DNA repair pathways, can help aid this effort. Therefore, gene panel B.O.P. (Breast, Ovarian, and Prostate) was developed to evaluate the genetic risk of breast, ovarian and/or prostate cancer, and this manuscript serves as an introduction to B.O.P. and highlights its initial analytical validity assessment. B.O.P targets 87 genes that have been suggested, predicted, or clinically proven to be associated with breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer risk using Agilent Technologies Haloplex probes. The probes were designed for 100 base pair reads on an Illumina platform and target both coding and non-coding exons as well as 10 intronic base pairs flanking the intron-exon boundaries. The initial B.O.P screening involved 43 individuals from the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort, and an average sequencing depth of 809X was obtained. Upon variant filtering and validation, true positives had an average sequencing depth of 659X and allele balance of 0.51. The average false positive sequencing depth was 34X and allele balance was 0.33. Although low sequencing depth was not always indicative of a false positive, high sequencing depths (>100X) signified a true positive. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity of BRCA1/2 were calculated to be 100% and 92.3%, respectively. Overall, this screening enabled the establishment of criteria to alleviate future validation efforts and strongly supports the use of B.O.P. to further elucidate hereditary cancer susceptibility. Ultimately, continued B.O.P. screening will provide insights toward the genetic risk of and overlap between breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer.

AB Objective: Lupus is a complex, heterogeneous autoimmune disease that has yet to see significant progress towards more timely diagnosis, improved treatment options for short-term and long-term outcomes, and appropriate access to care. The Addressing Lupus Pillars for Health Advancement (ALPHA) project is the first step in establishing global consensus and developing concrete strategies to address the challenges limiting progress.; Methods: A Global Advisory Committee of 13 individuals guided the project and began barrier identification. Seventeen expert interviews were conducted to further characterise key barriers. Transcripts were analysed using Nvivo and a codebook was created containing a list of thematic 'nodes' (topics) and their descriptions. Findings were used to develop a final survey instrument that was fielded to a diverse, international stakeholder audience to achieve broad consensus.; Results: Expert interviews identified lupus heterogeneity as the primary barrier hindering advancement. Subsequent barriers were categorised into three areas: (1) Drug development. (2) Clinical care. (3) Access and value. The global survey received 127 completed responses from experts across 20 countries. Respondents identified barriers as high priority including the lack of biomarkers for clinical and drug development use, flawed clinical trial design, lack of access to clinicians familiar with lupus, and obstacles to effective management of lupus due to social determinants of care. Respondents also identified 30 autoimmune conditions that may be lupus-related based on overlapping features, shared autoantibodies and pathophysiology.; Conclusions: ALPHA is a comprehensive initiative to identify and prioritise the continuum of challenges facing people with lupus by engaging a global audience of lupus experts. It also explored views on lupus as a spectrum of related diseases. Conclusions from this effort provide a framework to generate actionable approaches to the identified high-priority barriers.

AB Malpractice is civil wrong actionable by law. It is true, we have statistically an outside chance of getting sued. Among physicians of all specialties, we have, between 2.6% in North America and 1.3% in Europe, chance of facing malpractice suit. But, that is no comfort for one being sued. Malpractice generally involves, among others, wrongdoing or professional misconduct. It may or may not lead to legal action. I describe two cases of malpractice and its impact on the morale of my mental health team. In one case, the family were seeking compensation by claiming "medical negligence" in a trivial mishap. They had involved the local press to "publicize" their claim. In another case, the grievance arose due to anti-electroconvulsive therapy views of the patient's sister. The families decided not to sue us and accepted decisions of local inquiry. Not much is written on this subject in our country. The cases are almost 20 years old but are still relevant. The author describes the harrowing experience of the team members while the investigation was on. Fortunately, the inquiry panel concluded the proceedings in just 4 weeks. In addition, the author advises how one can prepare the defense. The readers would find informative the case vignettes and strategy to deal with the crisis.

AB Family health history (FHH) is the most useful means of assessing risk for common chronic diseases. The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly. Software that allows integration of FHH with the electronic medical record and clinical decision support capabilities has provided solutions to many of these challenges. Patient facing, electronic medical record, and web-enabled FHH platforms have been developed, and can provide greater identification of risk compared with conventional FHH ascertainment in primary care. FHH, along with cascade screening, can be an important component of population health management approaches to overall reduction of risk. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devasting disease. Progress has been made to define molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis due, in part, to the near-complete understanding of AML genome. Nonetheless, functional studies are necessary to assess the significance of AML-associated mutations and devise urgently needed therapies. Genome-wide knockout screening, employing CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, is a powerful tool in functional genomics. In this study, genome-wide CRISPR screening was performed using mouse leukemia cell lines developed in our Center, followed by in vivo screening. Among 20,611 genes, 130 AML essential genes were identified, including clinically actionable candidates. It was shown that mRNA decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS), an enzyme implicated in mRNA decay pathway, is essential for AML survival. ShRNA-mediated gene knockdown and DCPS inhibitor (RG3039) were employed to validate findings. RG3039 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis revealed an association between DCPS and RNA metabolic pathways, and RNA-Seq showed that RG3039 treatment induced aberrant mRNA splicing in AML cells. Importantly, RG3039 exhibited anti-leukemia effects in PDX models. These findings identify DCPS as a novel therapeutic target for AML, shedding new light on the nuclear RNA metabolic pathway in leukemogenesis.

AB Background: In response to increasing mass casualty events nationwide, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma developed a bleeding control course (Stop the Bleed) to teach hemorrhage control techniques to laypeople. There is a high level of public interest in learning about injury mitigation, but no study evaluating learners' perspectives after bleeding control training. We sought to evaluate the didactic value of the bleeding control course by analyzing learners' feedback within the framework of adult learning theory.; Study design: We analyzed a total of 720 open-ended surveys from 20 regional bleeding control courses taught by a level I trauma center team during a 9-month period. Major themes expressed by learners were organized into a categorical code structure. Keywords identified from free text responses were used to code comments into subthemes. These themes were organized into categories within the framework of adult learning theory.; Results: The two primary themes identified from learners' feedback were empowerment and practicality. Respondents reported an overwhelmingly positive experience; 97% of participants would recommend the course to others. The course design (lecture, didactics and hands-on activities) was cited as a positive element of the course. Participants felt empowered and prepared to act and help others during mass emergency events. Actionable items for future course improvement were identified.; Conclusion: Themes from learners' feedback fit within the framework of adult learning theory. These findings highlight the bleeding control course as an empowering experience and a practical and engaging approach to teaching hemorrhage mitigation to the public.; Level of evidence: Level V, qualitative analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: Approximately two thirds of patients with localized triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) harbor residual disease (RD) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and have a high risk-of-recurrence. Targeted therapeutic development for TNBC is of primary significance as no targeted therapies are clinically indicated for this aggressive subset. In view of this, we conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis and correlated molecular features of chemorefractory RD tumors with recurrence for the purpose of guiding downstream therapeutic development.; METHODS: We assembled DNA and RNA sequencing data from RD tumors as well as pre-operative biopsies, lymphocytic infiltrate, and survival data as part of a molecular correlative to a phase II post-neoadjuvant clinical trial. Matched somatic mutation, gene expression, and lymphocytic infiltrate were assessed before and after chemotherapy to understand how tumors evolve during chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted categorizing cancers with TP53 mutations by the degree of loss as well as by the copy number of a locus of 18q corresponding to the SMAD2, SMAD4, and SMAD7 genes.; RESULTS: Analysis of matched somatic genomes pre-/post-NAC revealed chaotic acquisition of copy gains and losses including amplification of prominent oncogenes. In contrast, significant gains in deleterious point mutations and insertion/deletions were not observed. No trends between clonal evolution and recurrence were identified. Gene expression data from paired biopsies revealed enrichment of actionable regulators of stem cell-like behavior and depletion of immune signaling, which was corroborated by total lymphocytic infiltrate, but was not associated with recurrence. Novel characterization of TP53 mutation revealed prognostically relevant subgroups, which were linked to MYC-driven transcriptional amplification. Finally, somatic gains in 18q were associated with poor prognosis, likely driven by putative upregulation of TGFSS signaling through the signal transducer SMAD2.; CONCLUSIONS: We conclude TNBCs are dynamic during chemotherapy, demonstrating complex plasticity in subclonal diversity, stem-like qualities, and immune depletion, but somatic alterations of TP53/MYC and TGFSS signaling in RD samples are prominent drivers of recurrence, representing high-yield targets for additional interrogation.

AB With the success rate of drugs for CNS indications at an all-time low, new approaches are needed to turn the tide of failed clinical trials. This paper reviews the history of CNS drug Discovery over the last 60 years and proposes a new paradigm based on the lessons learned. The initial wave of successful therapeutics discovered using careful clinical observations was followed by an emphasis on a phenotypic target-agnostic approach, often leading to successful drugs with a rich pharmacology. The subsequent introduction of molecular biology and the focus on a target-driven strategy has largely dominated drug discovery efforts over the last 30 years, but has not increased the probability of success, because these highly selective molecules are unlikely to address the complex pathological phenotypes of most CNS disorders. In many cases, reliance on preclinical animal models has lacked robust translational power. We argue that Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), a mechanism-based computer model of biological processes informed by preclinical knowledge and enhanced by neuroimaging and clinical data could be a new powerful knowledge generator engine and paradigm for rational polypharmacy. Progress in the academic discipline of computational neurosciences, allows one to model the effect of pathology and therapeutic interventions on neuronal circuit firing activity that can relate to clinical phenotypes, driven by complex properties of specific brain region activation states. The model is validated by optimizing the correlation between relevant emergent properties of these neuronal circuits and historical clinical and imaging datasets. A rationally designed polypharmacy target profile will be discovered using reverse engineering and sensitivity analysis. Small molecules will be identified using a combination of Artificial Intelligence methods and computational modeling, tested subsequently in heterologous cellular systems with human targets. Animal models will be used to establish target engagement and for ADME-Tox, with the QSP approach complemented by in vivo preclinical models that can be further refined to increase predictive validity. The QSP platform can also mitigate the variability in clinical trials with the concept of virtual patients. Because the QSP platform integrates knowledge from a wide variety of sources in an actionable simulation, it offers the possibility of substantially improving the success rate of CNS R&D programs while, at the same time, reducing both cost and the number of animals.

AB Future of clinical development is on the verge of a major transformation due to convergence of large new digital data sources, computing power to identify clinically meaningful patterns in the data using efficient artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms, and regulators embracing this change through new collaborations. This perspective summarizes insights, recent developments, and recommendations for infusing actionable computational evidence into clinical development and health care from academy, biotechnology industry, nonprofit foundations, regulators, and technology corporations. Analysis and learning from publically available biomedical and clinical trial data sets, real-world evidence from sensors, and health records by machine-learning architectures are discussed. Strategies for modernizing the clinical development process by integration of AI- and ML-based digital methods and secure computing technologies through recently announced regulatory pathways at the United States Food and Drug Administration are outlined. We conclude by discussing applications and impact of digital algorithmic evidence to improve medical care for patients.

AB Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) activate the redox-sensitive Ras small GTPases. The three canonical genes (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS) are archetypes of the superfamily of small GTPases and are the most common oncogenes in human cancer. Oncogenic Ras is intimately linked to redox biology, mainly in the context of tumorigenesis. The Ras protein structure is highly conserved, especially in effector-binding regions. Ras small GTPases are redox-sensitive proteins thanks to the presence of the NKCD motif (Asn116-Lys 117-Cys118-Asp119). Notably, the ROS- and RNS-based oxidation of Cys118 affects protein stability, activity, and localization, and protein-protein interactions. Cys residues at positions 80, 181, 184, and 186 may also help modulate these actions. Moreover, oncogenic mutations of Gly12Cys and Gly13Cys may introduce additional oxidative centres and represent actionable drug targets. Here, the pathophysiological involvement of Cys-redox regulation of Ras proteins is reviewed in the context of cancer and heart and brain diseases. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND: Claudin-low breast cancer is a molecular subtype associated with poor prognosis and without targeted treatment options. The claudin-low subtype is defined by certain biological characteristics, some of which may be clinically actionable, such as high immunogenicity. In mice, the medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumor model yields a heterogeneous set of tumors, a subset of which display claudin-low features. Neither the genomic characteristics of MPA/DMBA-induced claudin-low tumors nor those of human claudin-low breast tumors have been thoroughly explored.; METHODS: The transcriptomic characteristics and subtypes of MPA/DMBA-induced mouse mammary tumors were determined using gene expression microarrays. Somatic mutations and copy number aberrations in MPA/DMBA-induced tumors were identified from whole exome sequencing data. A publicly available dataset was queried to explore the genomic characteristics of human claudin-low breast cancer and to validate findings in the murine tumors.; RESULTS: Half of MPA/DMBA-induced tumors showed a claudin-low-like subtype. All tumors carried mutations in known driver genes. While the specific genes carrying mutations varied between tumors, there was a consistent mutational signature with an overweight of T>A transversions in TG dinucleotides. Most tumors carried copy number aberrations with a potential oncogenic driver effect. Overall, several genomic events were observed recurrently; however, none accurately delineated claudin-low-like tumors. Human claudin-low breast cancers carried a distinct set of genomic characteristics, in particular a relatively low burden of mutations and copy number aberrations. The gene expression characteristics of claudin-low-like MPA/DMBA-induced tumors accurately reflected those of human claudin-low tumors, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype, high level of immune activation, and low degree of differentiation. There was an elevated expression of the immunosuppressive genes PTGS2 (encoding COX-2) and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) in human and murine claudin-low tumors.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the claudin-low breast cancer subtype is not demarcated by specific genomic aberrations, but carries potentially targetable characteristics warranting further research.

AB Few studies have used genomic epidemiology to understand tuberculosis (TB) transmission in rural and remote settings - regions often unique in history, geography and demographics. To improve our understanding of TB transmission dynamics in Yukon Territory (YT), a circumpolar Canadian territory, we conducted a retrospective analysis in which we combined epidemiological data collected through routine contact investigations with clinical and laboratory results. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all culture-confirmed TB cases in YT (2005-2014) were genotyped using 24-locus Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) and compared to each other and to those from the neighbouring province of British Columbia (BC). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of genotypically clustered isolates revealed three sustained transmission networks within YT, two of which also involved BC isolates. While each network had distinct characteristics, all had at least one individual acting as the probable source of three or more culture-positive cases. Overall, WGS revealed that TB transmission dynamics in YT are distinct from patterns of spread in other, more remote Northern Canadian regions, and that the combination of WGS and epidemiological data can provide actionable information to local public health teams.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic medicine has paved the way for identifying biomarkers and therapeutically actionable targets for complex diseases, but is complicated by the involvement of thousands of variably expressed genes across multiple cell types. Single-cell RNA-sequencing study (scRNA-seq) allows the characterization of such complex changes in whole organs.; METHODS: The study is based on applying network tools to organize and analyze scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis and human rheumatoid arthritis, in order to find diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Diagnostic validation studies were performed using expression profiling data and potential protein biomarkers from prospective clinical studies of 13 diseases. A candidate drug was examined by a treatment study of a mouse model of arthritis, using phenotypic, immunohistochemical, and cellular analyses as read-outs.; RESULTS: We performed the first systematic analysis of pathways, potential biomarkers, and drug targets in scRNA-seq data from a complex disease, starting with inflamed joints and lymph nodes from a mouse model of arthritis. We found the involvement of hundreds of pathways, biomarkers, and drug targets that differed greatly between cell types. Analyses of scRNA-seq and GWAS data from human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) supported a similar dispersion of pathogenic mechanisms in different cell types. Thus, systems-level approaches to prioritize biomarkers and drugs are needed. Here, we present a prioritization strategy that is based on constructing network models of disease-associated cell types and interactions using scRNA-seq data from our mouse model of arthritis, as well as human RA, which we term multicellular disease models (MCDMs). We find that the network centrality of MCDM cell types correlates with the enrichment of genes harboring genetic variants associated with RA and thus could potentially be used to prioritize cell types and genes for diagnostics and therapeutics. We validated this hypothesis in a large-scale study of patients with 13 different autoimmune, allergic, infectious, malignant, endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as a therapeutic study of the mouse arthritis model.; CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support that our strategy has the potential to help prioritize diagnostic and therapeutic targets in human disease.

AB Cryptococcal meningitis is a potentially devastating infectious complication of immunosuppression best characterized in individuals with HIV. Early recognition of and appropriate antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis has a profound effect on outcomes, but with more varied presentations in well-resourced countries recognition may be delayed. We present four cases of cryptococcal meningitis in immunosuppressed patients, each with significant delays in diagnosis. Pulling from recollections of providers and the documented chart assessments, we discuss and tabulate the cognitive biases and diagnostic errors that contributed to delay. We further explore the knowledge deficits regarding cryptococcal meningitis that appeared in these cases. Once meningitis was considered, each of these cases of cryptococcal meningitis was rapidly diagnosed. Diagnostic delay was driven by knowledge deficits, followed by common biases such as availability heuristics and premature closing. These delays could be countered by maintaining broad differential diagnoses, re-evaluating the patient presentation after recognition of immunosuppression, and early consultation of specialists. Delay in diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. By exploring the various case presentations and errors made, we hope to provide a counter to some of the knowledge deficits associated with cryptococcal meningitis, and to provide actionable advice for early consultation to infectious disease specialists in order to improve outcomes.

AB Plasma genotyping identifies potentially actionable mutations at variable mutant allele frequencies, often admixed with multiple subclonal variants, highlighting the need for their clinical and functional validation. We prospectively monitored plasma genotypes in 143 women with endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC), identifying multiple novel mutations including HER2 mutations (8.4%), albeit at different frequencies highlighting clinical heterogeneity. To evaluate functional significance, we established ex vivo culture from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a patient with HER2-mutant MBC, which revealed resistance to multiple targeted therapies including endocrine and CDK 4/6 inhibitors, but high sensitivity to neratinib (IC50: 0.018muM). Immunoblotting analysis of the HER2-mutant CTC culture line revealed high levels of HER2 expression at baseline were suppressed by neratinib, which also abrogated downstream signaling, highlighting oncogenic dependency with HER2 mutation. Furthermore, treatment of an index patient with HER2-mutant MBC with the irreversible HER2 inhibitor neratinib resulted in significant clinical response, with complete molecular resolution of two distinct clonal HER2 mutations, with persistence of other passenger subclones, confirming HER2 alteration as a driver mutation. Thus, driver HER2 mutant alleles that emerge during blood-based monitoring of endocrine-resistant MBC confer novel therapeutic vulnerability, and ex vivo expansion of viable CTCs from the blood circulation may broadly complement plasma-based mutational analysis in MBC.

AB Transition of acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents an important cause of kidney failure. However, how AKI is transformed into CKD remains elusive. Following folic acid injury, mice developed AKI with ensuing CKD transition, featured by variable degrees of interstitial fibrosis and tubular cell atrophy and growth arrest. This lingering injury of renal tubules was associated with sustained oxidative stress that was concomitant with an impaired Nrf2 antioxidant defense, marked by mitigated Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and blunted induction of its target antioxidant enzymes, like heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Activation of the canonical Keap1/Nrf2 signaling, nevertheless, seems intact during CKD transition because Nrf2 in injured tubules remained activated and elevated in cytoplasm. Moreover, oxidative thiol modification and activation of Keap1, the cytoplasmic repressor of Nrf2, was barely associated with CKD transition. In contrast, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3beta, a key modulator of the Keap1-independent Nrf2 regulation, was persistently overexpressed and hyperactive in injured tubules. Likewise, in patients who developed CKD following AKI due to diverse etiologies, like volume depletion and exposure to radiocontrast agents or aristolochic acid, sustained GSK3beta overexpression was evident in renal tubules and coincided with oxidative damages, impaired Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and mitigated induction of antioxidant gene expression. Mechanistically, the Nrf2 response against oxidative insult was sabotaged in renal tubular cells expressing a constitutively active mutant of GSK3beta, but reinforced by ectopic expression of dominant negative GSK3beta in a Keap1-independent manner. In vivo in folic acid-injured mice, targeting GSK3beta in renal tubules via conditional knockout or by weekly microdose lithium treatment reinstated Nrf2 antioxidant response in the kidney and hindered AKI to CKD transition. Ergo, our findings suggest that GSK3beta-mediated Keap1-independent regulation of Nrf2 may serve as an actionable therapeutic target for modifying the long-term sequelae of AKI.

AB Background: Allele specific real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are widely used to detect somatic mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both methods commonly use formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues as diagnostic materials. Real-time PCR has the advantage of being easy to use and more tolerant of variable DNA quality, but has limited multiplex capability. NGS, in contrast, allows simultaneous analysis of many genomic loci while revealing the exact sequence changes; it is, however, more technically demanding and more expensive to employed. A challenge for both platforms is the varied limit of detection (LoD) for target genomic loci, even within the same gene. The variability of detection sensitivity may be problematic if well-known actionable somatic mutations are missed.; Cases: We compared LoDs between real-time PCR and targeted NGS tests for some commonly observed EGFR mutations in NSCLC specimens.; Conclusions: The FDA-approved real-time PCR test was superior to the NGS in detecting low level EGFR exon 19 deletion (near 1% variant allele fraction (VAF)). The cancer hotspot NGS detects low level EGFR c.2369C > T, p.T790M (2-5% VAF) better than the FDA-approved real-time PCR method. We conclude that the real-time PCR and hotspot NGS methods have complementary strengths in accurately determining clinically important EGFR mutations in NSCLC.

AB BACKGROUND: The natural histories of, and treatment options for, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are distinctly different from those of lung cancer that lacks actionable mutations. Ipilimumab is a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor that has been approved in other malignancies.; OBJECTIVE: A phase I trial of ipilimumab plus targeted therapy with either erlotinib or crizotinib was performed to assess the safety of the combination in patients with EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC.; METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged NSCLC on a stable dose of erlotinib or crizotinib for>28days were eligible for the study. Patients were treated with ipilimumab 3mg/kg for four cycles plus erlotinib or crizotinib.; RESULTS: Treatment of the EGFR cohort resulted in dose-limiting toxicity in three of eight patients, with grade 3 diarrhea. The protocol was amended to reduce the ipilimumab dose to 1mg/kg. Excessive toxicity resulted in the study being closed after 14 patients. Four of 11 EGFR-mutated patients ultimately developed grade 3 colitis. Of three ALK-rearranged patients, one developed hypophysitis and another grade 2 pneumonitis. For 11 EGFR-mutated patients, progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of ipilimumab was 17.9months. Erlotinib treatment began a median 7.7months before ipilimumab; therefore, erlotinib PFS was 27.8months. Median overall survival (OS) has not been reached but will be>42.3months from erlotinib initiation. For three ALK-rearranged patients, ipilimumab PFS was 24.1months. Median OS has not been reached but will be at least 47.2months from the initiation of crizotinib.; CONCLUSION: Erlotinib plus ipilimumab caused excessive short-term gastrointestinal toxicity leading to early study closure. However, PFS and OS were notable; therefore, targeted therapies with immunotherapy in NSCLC merit further study. Clinicaltrials.gov registration number: NCT01998126.

AB The digital revolution is disrupting the ways in which health research is conducted, and subsequently, changing healthcare. Direct-to-consumer wellness products and mobile apps, pervasive sensor technologies and access to social network data offer exciting opportunities for researchers to passively observe and/or track patients 'in the wild' and 24/7. The volume of granular personal health data gathered using these technologies is unprecedented, and is increasingly leveraged to inform personalized health promotion and disease treatment interventions. The use of artificial intelligence in the health sector is also increasing. Although rich with potential, the digital health ecosystem presents new ethical challenges for those making decisions about the selection, testing, implementation and evaluation of technologies for use in healthcare. As the 'Wild West' of digital health research unfolds, it is important to recognize who is involved, and identify how each party can and should take responsibility to advance the ethical practices of this work. While not a comprehensive review, we describe the landscape, identify gaps to be addressed, and offer recommendations as to how stakeholders can and should take responsibility to advance socially responsible digital health research.

AB Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer. Despite its low incidence, it accounts for a disproportionate number of thyroid cancer-related deaths, because of its resistance to current therapeutic approaches. Novel actionable targets are urgently needed to prolong patient survival and increase their quality of life. Loss and mutation of the RB1 tumor suppressor are rare events in ATC, which suggests that therapies directed at inhibiting the cyclin D/CDK4 complexes, responsible for RB phosphorylation and inactivation, might be effective in this tumor type. In fact, we found that the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, strongly inhibits proliferation in all the RB1 wild type ATC cell lines tested. Efficacy was also observed in vivo, in a xenograft model. However, ATC cells rapidly developed resistance to palbociclib. Resistance was associated with increased levels of cyclin D1 and D3. To counter cyclin D overexpression, we tested the effect of combining palbociclib with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, omipalisib. Combined treatment synergistically reduced cell proliferation, even in cell lines that do not carry PI3K-activating mutations. More importantly, low-dose combination was dramatically effective in inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft model. Thus, combined PI3K/mTOR and CDK4/6 inhibition is a highly promising novel approach for the treatment of aggressive, therapy-resistant thyroid cancer.

AB Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) aims to connect scientists across silos by assembling models of the literature to reveal previously hidden connections. Unfortunately, LBD systems have been unable to achieve user adoption on a large scale. This work develops opens source software in Python to convert a database of semantic predications of all of PubMed's 27.9 million indexed abstracts into a semantic inference network and biomedical concept graph in Neo4j. The developed software, called SemNet, queries a modified version of the publicly available SemMedDB and computes feature vectors on source-target pairs. Each unique United Medical Language System (UMLS) concept is represented as a node and each predication as an edge. Each node is assigned one of 132 node labels (e.g., Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein (AAPP); Gene or Genome (GG); etc.) and each edge is labeled with one of 58 predications (e.g. treats, causes, inhibits, etc.). SemNet computes a single feature value for each metapath, or sequence of node types, between a source node and user-specified target node(s). Several different types of metapath-based features (count, degree weighted path count, and HeteSim metric) are computed and vectorized. SemNet employs an unsupervised learning algorithm for rank aggregation (ULARA) to rank identified source nodes that are most relevant to the user-specified target nodes(s). Statistical analysis of correlation among identified source nodes or resultant literature network features are used to identify patterns that can guide future research. Analysis of high residual nodes is used to compare and contrast SemNet rankings between different targets of interest. An example SemNet use case is presented to assess "the differential impact of smoking on cognition in males and females" using the following target nodes: nicotine, learning, memory, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cigarette smoke, X chromosome, and Y chromosome. Detailed rankings are discussed. Overall results suggest a hypothesis where smoking negatively impacts cognition to a greater extent in females, but smoking has stronger cardiovascular impacts in males. In summary, SemNet provides an adoptable method for efficient LBD of PubMed that extends beyond omics-only relationships to true multi-scalar connections that can provide actionable insight for predictive medicine, research prioritization, and clinical care.

AB Introduction: The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) indicated a list of actionable genotypes that affect patients' response to more 50 drugs; these drugs which show variable effects based on patients' genetic traits were named as pharmacogenetics (PGX) drugs. Preemptive genetic testing before using these drugs may protect certain patients from serious adverse reactions and could help in avoiding treatment failures. The objectives of this study include identifying the rate of PGX drug usage among Dutch population, estimating the level of users who carry the actionable genotypes and determining the main genes involved in drug's effect variability.; Methods: Usage of PGX drugs over 2011-2017 by the insured population (an average of 11.4 million) in outpatient clinics in Netherlands was obtained from the publically available GIP databank. The data of 45 drugs were analyzed and their interactions with selected pharmacogenes were estimated. Frequency of actionable genotypes of 249 Dutch parents was obtained from the public database: Genome of Netherlands (GoNL), to identify the pattern of genetic characteristics of Dutch population.; Results: Over a 7 year period, 51.3 million exposures of patients to PGX drugs were reported with an average of 5.3 exposures per each drug user. One quarterof the exposures (12.4 million) are predicted to be experienced by individuals with actionable genotypes (risky exposures). Up to 60% of the risky exposures (around 7.5 million) were related to drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. SLCO1B1, and CYP2C19 were also identified among the top genes affecting response of drugs users (involved in about 22 and 12.4% of the risky exposures, respectively). Cardiovascular medications were the top prescribed PGX drug class (43%), followed by gastroenterology (29%) and psychiatry/neurology medications (15%). Women use more PGX drugs than men (55.8 vs. 44.2%, respectively) with the majority (84%) of users in both sexes are above 45 years.; Conclusion: PGX drugs are commonly used in Netherlands. Preemptive panel testing for CYP2D6, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C19 only could be useful to predict 95% of vulnerable patients' exposures to PGX drugs. Future studies to assess the economic impact of preemptive panel testing on patients of older age are suggested.

AB Background: Research demonstrates that the placebo effect can influence the effectiveness of medical treatments and accounts for a significant proportion of healing in many conditions. However, providers may differ in the degree to which they consciously or unconsciously leverage the forces that produce placebo effects in clinical practice. Some studies suggest that the manner in which providers interact with patients shapes the magnitude of placebo effects, but this research has yet to distill the specific dimensions of patient-provider interactions that are most likely to influence placebo response and the mechanisms through which aspects of patient-provider interactions impact placebo response. Methods: We offer a simplifying and unifying framework in which interactions that boost placebo response can be dissected into two key dimensions: patients' perceptions of competence, or whether a doctor "gets it" (i.e., displays of efficiency, knowledge, and skill), and patients' perceptions of warmth, or whether a doctor "gets me" (i.e., displays of personal engagement, connection, and care for the patient). Results: First, we discuss how this framework builds on past research in psychology on social perception of competence and warmth and in medical literature on models of effective medical care, patient satisfaction, and patient-provider interactions. Then we consider possible mechanisms through which competence and warmth may affect the placebo response in healthcare. Finally, we share original data from patients and providers highlighting how this framework applies to healthcare. Both patient and provider data illustrate actionable ways providers can demonstrate competence and warmth to patients. Discussion: We conclude with recommendations for how researchers and practitioners alike can more systematically consider the role of provider competence and warmth in patient-provider interactions to deepen our understanding of placebo effects and, ultimately, enable providers to boost placebo effects alongside active medications (i.e., with known medical ingredients) and treatment in clinical care.

AB In this manuscript we discuss the consequences of methodological choices when studying team processes "in the wild." We chose teams in healthcare as the application because teamwork cannot only save lives but the processes constituting effective teamwork in healthcare are prototypical for teamwork as they range from decision-making (e.g., in multidisciplinary decision-making boards in cancer care) to leadership and coordination (e.g., in fast-paced, acute-care settings in trauma, surgery and anesthesia) to reflection and learning (e.g., in post-event clinical debriefings). We draw upon recently emphasized critique that much empirical team research has focused on describing team states rather than investigating how team processes dynamically unfurl over time and how these dynamics predict team outcomes. This focus on statics instead of dynamics limits the gain of applicable knowledge on team functioning in organizations. We first describe three examples from healthcare that reflect the importance, scope, and challenges of teamwork: multidisciplinary decision-making boards, fast-paced, acute care settings, and post-event clinical team debriefings. Second, we put the methodological approaches of how teamwork in these representative examples has mostly been studied centerstage (i.e., using mainly surveys, database reviews, and rating tools) and highlight how the resulting findings provide only limited insights into the actual team processes and the quality thereof, leaving little room for identifying and targeting success factors. Third, we discuss how methodical approaches that take dynamics into account (i.e., event- and time-based behavior observation and micro-level coding, social sensor-based measurement) would contribute to the science of teams by providing actionable knowledge about interaction processes of successful teamwork.

AB PURPOSE: We evaluated genome sequencing (GS) as an alternative to multigene panel sequencing (PS) for genetic testing in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).; METHODS: Forty-two patients with familial DCM underwent PS and GS, and detection rates of rare single-nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions in panel genes were compared. Loss-of-function variants in 406 cardiac-enriched genes were evaluated, and an assessment of structural variation was performed.; RESULTS: GS provided broader and more uniform coverage than PS, with high concordance for rare variant detection in panel genes. GS identified all PS-identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants as well as two additional likely pathogenic variants: one was missed by PS due to low coverage, the other was a known disease-causing variant in a gene not included on the panel. No loss-of-function variants in the extended gene set met clinical criteria for pathogenicity. One BAG3 structural variant was classified as pathogenic.; CONCLUSION: Our data support the use of GS for genetic testing in DCM, with high variant detection accuracy and a capacity to identify structural variants. GS provides an opportunity to go beyond suites of established disease genes, but the incremental yield of clinically actionable variants is limited by a paucity of genetic and functional evidence for DCM association.

AB Africa is experiencing an increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCD). However, few reliable data are available on their true burden, main risk factors, and economic impact that are needed to inform implementation of evidence-based interventions in the local context. In Malawi, a number of initiatives have begun addressing the NCD challenge, which have often utilized existing infectious disease infrastructure. It will be crucial to carefully leverage these synergies to maximize their impact. NCD-BRITE (Building Research Capacity, Implementation, and Translation Expertise) is a transdisciplinary consortium that brings together key research institutions, the Ministry of Health, and other stakeholders to build long-term, sustainable, NCD-focused implementation research capacity. Led by University of Malawi-College of Medicine, University of North Carolina, and Dignitas International, NCD-BRITE's specific aims are to conduct detailed assessments of the burden and risk factors of common NCD; assess the research infrastructure needed to inform, implement, and evaluate NCD interventions; create a national implementation research agenda for priority NCD; and develop NCD-focused implementation research capacity through short courses, mentored research awards, and an internship placement program. The capacity-building activities are purposely designed around the University of Malawi-College of Medicine and Ministry of Health to ensure sustainability. The NCD BRITE Consortium was launched in February 2018. In year 1, we have developed NCD-focused implementation research capacity. Needs assessments will follow in years 2 and 3. Finally, in year 4, the generated research capacity, together with findings from the needs assessments, will be used to create a national, actionable, implementation research agenda for NCD prioritized in this consortium, namely cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB Cancer cells with heterogeneous mutation landscapes and extensive functional redundancy easily develop resistance to monotherapies by emerging activation of compensating or bypassing pathways. To achieve more effective and sustained clinical responses, synergistic interactions of multiple druggable targets that inhibit redundant cancer survival pathways are often required. Here, we report a systematic polypharmacology strategy to predict, test, and understand the selective drug combinations for MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells. We started by applying our network pharmacology model to predict synergistic drug combinations. Next, by utilizing kinome-wide drug-target profiles and gene expression data, we pinpointed a synergistic target interaction between Aurora B and ZAK kinase inhibition that led to enhanced growth inhibition and cytotoxicity, as validated by combinatorial siRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, and drug combination experiments. The mechanism of such a context-specific target interaction was elucidated using a dynamic simulation of MDA-MB-231 signaling network, suggesting a cross-talk between p53 and p38 pathways. Our results demonstrate the potential of polypharmacological modeling to systematically interrogate target interactions that may lead to clinically actionable and personalized treatment options.

AB Background: Paired tumor-normal targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is primarily used to identify actionable somatic mutations, but can also detect germline variants including pathogenic germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes that underlie Lynch syndrome. In the present study we examined paired NGS data from lung cancer patients to identify germline mutations in MMR genes. As lung cancer is not one of the recognized Lynch syndrome-associated neoplasms, we also investigated whether these lung cancer cases are due to Lynch syndrome or are instead sporadic cancers occurring in Lynch syndrome patients. Methods: A retrospective study of 1,179 lung cancer patients with available paired NGS data was performed to identify germline mutations in the MMR genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, and evaluate tumor mutation burden (TMB). Microsatellite instability (MSI) testing was done on select cases with MMR gene mutations by either NGS or PCR/capillary electrophoresis approach. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins was performed in select patients. Results: Pathogenic or likely-pathogenic germline mutations in PMS2, MSH2, or MSH6 were detected in 0.5% (6/1,179) of lung cancer patients; three of the patients had a family history of colon or gastric cancer. The median age at diagnosis of these cases was 68.5 years old. None of these six patients exhibited MSI or loss of MMR protein expression. Among them, no second hit somatic mutations in MMR genes (including single-nucleotide variants, small insertions or deletions and copy number alterations) were detected, and the median TMB was 4.5 muts/MB. Subsequent genetic testing of family members identified new Lynch syndrome cases in two first-degree relatives. Conclusion: These data imply that lung cancers in Lynch syndrome patients are unrelated to the underlying Lynch syndrome diagnosis and occur spontaneously. Nonetheless, paired tumor-normal NGS can identify germline mutations to help reveal Lynch syndrome in cancer patients. This has important implications for cancer screening and risk reduction in these patients and their families.

AB Clinicians are often faced with situations where published treatment guidelines do not provide a clear recommendation. In such situations, evidence generated from similar patients' data captured in electronic health records (EHRs) can aid decision making. However, challenges in generating and making such evidence available have prevented its on-demand use to inform patient care. We propose that a specialty consultation service staffed by a team of medical and informatics experts can rapidly summarize 'what happened to patients like mine' using data from the EHR and other health data sources. By emulating a familiar physician workflow, and keeping experts in the loop, such a service can translate physician inquiries about situations with evidence gaps into actionable reports. The demand for and benefits gained from such a consult service will naturally vary by practice type and data robustness. However, we cannot afford to miss the opportunity to use the patient data captured every day via EHR systems to close the evidence gap between available clinical guidelines and realities of clinical practice. We have begun offering such a service to physicians at our academic medical center and believe that such a service should be core offering by clinical informatics professional throughout the country. Only if we launch such efforts broadly can we systematically study the utility of learning from the record of routine clinical practice.

AB This perspective paper describes the building elements for realizing a precise patient monitoring algorithm to fundamentally address the alarm fatigue problem. Alarm fatigue is well recognized but no solution has been widely successful. Physiologic patient monitors are responsible for the lion's share of alarms at the bedside, most of which are either false or non-actionable. Algorithms on patient monitors lack precision because they fail to leverage multivariate relationship among variables monitored, to integrate rich patient clinical information from electronic health record system, and to utilize temporal patterns in data streams. Therefore, a solution to patient monitor alarm fatigue is to open the black-box of patient monitors to integrate physiologic data with clinical data from EHR under a four-element algorithm strategy to be described in this paper. This strategy will be presented in this paper in the context of its current status as described in our prior publications.

AB Genomic medicine is set to drastically improve clinical care globally due to high throughput technologies which enable speedy in silico detection and analysis of clinically relevant mutations. However, the variability in the in silico prediction methods and categorization of functionally relevant genetic variants can pose specific challenges in some populations. In silico mutation prediction tools could lead to high rates of false positive/negative results, particularly in African genomes that harbor the highest genetic diversity and that are disproportionately underrepresented in public databases and reference panels. These issues are particularly relevant with the recent increase in initiatives, such as the Human Heredity and Health (H3Africa), that are generating huge amounts of genomic sequence data in the absence of policies to guide genomic researchers to return results of variants in so-called actionable genes to research participants. This report (i) provides an inventory of publicly available Whole Exome/Genome data from Africa which could help improve reference panels and explore the frequency of pathogenic variants in actionable genes and related challenges, (ii) reviews available in silico prediction mutation tools and the criteria for categorization of pathogenicity of novel variants, and (iii) proposes recommendations for analyzing pathogenic variants in African genomes for their use in research and clinical practice. In conclusion, this work proposes criteria to define mutation pathogenicity and actionability in human genetic research and clinical practice in Africa and recommends setting up an African expert panel to oversee the proposed criteria.

AB The gene encoding the transcription factor C/EBPalpha is mutated in 10-15% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. N-terminal CEBPA mutations cause ablation of full-length C/EBPalpha without affecting the expression of a shorter oncogenic isoform, termed p30. The mechanistic basis of p30-induced leukemogenesis is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the MLL1 histone-methyltransferase complex represents a critical actionable vulnerability in CEBPA-mutated AML. Oncogenic C/EBPalpha p30 and MLL1 show global co-localization on chromatin and p30 exhibits robust physical interaction with the MLL1 complex. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of MLL1 results in proliferation arrest and myeloid differentiation in C/EBPalpha p30-expressing cells. In line, CEBPA-mutated hematopoietic progenitor cells are hypersensitive to pharmacological targeting of the MLL1 complex. Inhibitor treatment impairs proliferation and restores myeloid differentiation potential in mouse and human AML cells with CEBPA mutations. Finally, we identify the transcription factor GATA2 as a direct critical target of the p30-MLL1 interaction. Altogether, we show that C/EBPalpha p30 requires the MLL1 complex to regulate oncogenic gene expression and that CEBPA-mutated AML is hypersensitive to perturbation of the MLL1 complex. These findings identify the MLL1 complex as a potential therapeutic target in AML with CEBPA mutations.

AB The rapid growth of electronic health records (EHRs) facilitates the use of clinical pathways, an actionable plan for patients which is represented as sequences of diagnostic records ordered by visit dates. We propose to extract discriminative and representative clinical pathways from EHRs using sequential pattern mining. However, existing sequential patterns cannot efficiently extract patterns due to patient variations in length and time period between visits. To resolve this problem, we propose FuzzyGap, a sequential pattern mining-based framework that extracts a discriminative subsequent pattern from the proper representation of the sequence of encounters which also emphasizes the last visit that is more significant than others. We demonstrate FuzzyGap using a case study of heart failure and show the effectiveness of sequential pattern mining.

AB CDK12 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that acts as regulator of DNA damage response gene expression. A c.1047-2A>G splice site variant of the CDK12 gene was recently reported to strongly associate with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in patients of Tatar ethnic origin. To gain more insight into the potential risk and the population spread of the c.1047-2A>G variant, we have genotyped three breast cancer case-control series of Tatar, Bashkir and Kazakh ethnicity. We identified c.1047-2A>G in 6/155 cases and 12/362 controls of Tatar ancestry, 0/96 cases and 9/189 controls of Bashkir ancestry, and 1/131 cases and 0/154 controls of Kazakh ancestry (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.30-1.70, p = 0.45). Consistent with the absence of a large effect, bioinformatic analyses predicted that c.1047-2A>G modulates alternative splicing of a NAGNAG sequence rather than constituting a loss-of-function allele, and RT-PCR analyses of c.1047-2A>G heterozygous lymphocytes verified the usage of the predicted alternative acceptor site. Our study confirms a high prevalence of CDK12*c.1047-2A>G in the Tatar and Bashkir population but excludes a role as a clinically actionable high-risk breast cancer mutation.

AB Prescription drug broadcast advertisements in the United States are required to present the product's major risks in at least the audio portion of the ad (21 CFR 202.1(e)(1)). This can result in a lengthy list of risks and side effects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been studying the effects of limiting the major statement to those risks that are serious and actionable. We explore the level of agreement between consumers and experts regarding what risks and side effects are serious and actionable, and how variations in the content of major risk statement as well as other factors such as demographic variables, perceived accuracy of direct-to-consumer advertising, illness knowledge, and knowledge of prescription drug regulations, predict perceptions of risk and actionability. Participants (N=1,000) self-diagnosed with depression or insomnia were randomly assigned to view a television ad for their respective condition that presented the full major statement or an edited version that included only serious and actionable risks. Results indicated consumers' perceptions of risk severity generally matched experts' assessment, but there was relatively less agreement about risk actionability. Results also varied as a function of income and gender.

AB Patterns of spatial behavior dictate how we use our infrastructure, encounter other people, or are exposed to services and opportunities. Understanding these patterns through the analysis of data commonly available through commodity smartphones has become an important arena for innovation in both academia and industry. The resulting datasets can quickly become massive, indicating the need for concise understanding of the scope of the data collected. Some data is obviously correlated (for example GPS location and which WiFi routers are seen). Codifying the extent of these correlations could identify potential new models, provide guidance on the amount of data to collect, and even provide actionable features. However, identifying correlations, or even the extent of correlation, is difficult because the form of the correlation must be specified. Fractal-based intrinsic dimensionality directly calculates the minimum number of dimensions required to represent a dataset. We provide an intrinsic dimensionality analysis of four smartphone datasets over seven input dimensions, and empirically demonstrate an intrinsic dimension of approximately two.

AB A real-time understanding of the distribution and duration of power outages after a major disaster is a precursor to minimizing their harmful consequences. Here, we develop an approach for using daily satellite nighttime lights data to create spatially disaggregated power outage estimates, tracking electricity restoration efforts after disasters strike. In contrast to existing utility data, these estimates are independent, open, and publicly-available, consistently measured across regions that may be serviced by several different power companies, and inclusive of distributed power supply (off-grid systems). We apply the methodology in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, which caused the longest blackout in US history. Within all of the island's settlements, we track outages and recovery times, and link these measures to census-based demographic characteristics of residents. Our results show an 80% decrease in lights, in total, immediately after Hurricane Maria. During the recovery, a disproportionate share of long-duration power failures (> 120 days) occurred in rural municipalities (41% of rural municipalities vs. 29% of urban municipalities), and in the northern and eastern districts. Unexpectedly, we also identify large disparities in electricity recovery between neighborhoods within the same urban area, based primarily on the density of housing. For many urban areas, poor residents, the most vulnerable to increased mortality and morbidity risks from power losses, shouldered the longest outages because they lived in less dense, detached housing where electricity restoration lagged. The approach developed in this study demonstrates the potential of satellite-based estimates of power recovery to improve the real-time monitoring of disaster impacts, globally, at a spatial resolution that is actionable for the disaster response community.

AB AIMS: Statin-related myopathy (SRM), which includes rhabdomyolysis, is an uncommon but important adverse drug reaction because the number of people prescribed statins world-wide is large. Previous association studies of common genetic variants have had limited success in identifying a genetic basis for this adverse drug reaction. We conducted a multi-site whole-exome sequencing study to investigate whether rare coding variants confer an increased risk of SRM.; METHODS AND RESULTS: SRM 3-5 cases (N = 505) and statin treatment-tolerant controls (N = 2047) were recruited from multiple sites in North America and Europe. SRM 3-5 was defined as symptoms consistent with muscle injury and an elevated creatine phosphokinase level >4 times upper limit of normal without another likely cause of muscle injury. Whole-exome sequencing and variant calling was coordinated from two analysis centres, and results of single-variant and gene-based burden tests were meta-analysed. No genome-wide significant associations were identified. Given the large number of cases, we had 80% power to identify a variant with minor allele frequency of 0.01 that increases the risk of SRM 6-fold at genome-wide significance.; CONCLUSIONS: In this large whole-exome sequencing study of severe statin-related muscle injury conducted to date, we did not find evidence that rare coding variants are responsible for this adverse drug reaction. Larger sample sizes would be required to identify rare variants with small effects, but it is unclear whether such findings would be clinically actionable.

AB Human breast cancer is characterized by a high degree of inter-patients heterogeneity in terms of histology, genomic alterations, gene expression patterns, and metastatic behavior, which deeply influences individual prognosis and treatment response. The main cause of mortality in breast cancer is the therapy-resistant metastatic disease, which sets the priority for novel treatment strategies for these patients. In the present study, we demonstrate that Patient Derived Xenografts (PDXs) that were obtained from metastatic and therapy-resistant breast cancer samples recapitulate the wide spectrum of the disease in terms of histologic subtypes and mutational profiles, as evaluated by whole exome sequencing. We have integrated genomic and transcriptomic data to identify oncogenic and actionable pathways in each PDX. By taking advantage of primary short-term in vitro cultures from PDX tumors, we showed their resistance to standard chemotherapy (Paclitaxel), as seen in the patients. Moreover, we selected targeting drugs and analyzed PDX sensitivity to single agents or to combination of targeted and standard therapy on the basis of PDX-specific genomic or transcriptomic alterations. Our data demonstrate that PDXs represent a suitable model to test new targeting drugs or drug combinations and to prioritize personalized therapeutic regimens for pre-clinal and clinical tests.

AB Estimates of Plasmodium falciparum migration may inform strategies for malaria elimination. Here we elucidate fine-scale parasite population structure and infer recent migration across Southeast Asia using identity-by-descent (IBD) approaches based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms called in 1722 samples from 54 districts. IBD estimates are consistent with isolation-by-distance. We observe greater sharing of larger IBD segments between artemisinin-resistant parasites versus sensitive parasites, which is consistent with the recent spread of drug resistance. Our IBD analyses reveal actionable patterns, including isolated parasite populations, which may be prioritized for malaria elimination, as well as asymmetrical migration identifying potential sources and sinks of migrating parasites.

AB BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is currently implemented in hospitals to optimize therapy with high-risk drugs. However, many drugs with dosing recommendations from the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium are used in primary care. Actionable phenotypes for the genes covered in these guidelines are common with estimates ranging from 85 to 95% of the population carrying at least one actionable phenotype. The goal of this study was to estimate the clinical impact of implementation of an upfront panel-based pharmacogenetic screening for eight genes related to drugs used in primary care for 2016.; METHODS: For this study, dispensing data concerning first prescription for the period January 1-December 31, 2016, were combined with frequency data obtained in the "Implementation of Pharmacogenetics into Primary Care Project" (IP3) study to estimate the occurrence of actionable gene-drug pairs in daily practice in community pharmacies.; RESULTS: In 23.6% of all new prescriptions of 45 drugs (n=856,002 new prescriptions/year), an actionable gene-drug interaction (GDI) was present according to the guidelines of the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group. More importantly, these GDIs would result in a dose adjustment or switch to another drug in 5.4% of all new prescriptions.; CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, with an anticipated near future where healthcare professionals will be regularly confronted with PGx test results, adjusting pharmacotherapy based on this information will become a routine task in healthcare.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has advanced knowledge of the genomic landscape of ovarian cancer, leading to an innovative molecular classification of the disease. However, patient survival and response to platinum-based treatments are still not predictable based on the tumor genetic profile. This retrospective study characterized the repertoire of somatic mutations in advanced ovarian cancer to identify tumor genetic markers predictive of platinum chemo-resistance and prognosis. Using targeted NGS, 79 primary advanced (III-IV stage, tumor grade G2-3) ovarian cancer tumors, including 64 high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), were screened with a 26 cancer-genes panel. Patients, enrolled between 1995 and 2011, underwent primary debulking surgery (PDS) with optimal residual disease (RD < 1 cm) and platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment. We found a heterogeneous mutational landscape in some uncommon ovarian histotypes and in HGSOC tumor samples with relevance in predicting platinum sensitivity. In particular, we identified a poor prognostic signature in patients with HGSOC harboring concurrent mutations in two driver actionable genes of the panel. The tumor heterogeneity described, sheds light on the translational potential of targeted NGS approach for the identification of subgroups of patients with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities, that are modulated by the specific mutational profile expressed by the ovarian tumor.

AB This paper describes the lessons gained and actions taken following the evacuation of two small rural hospitals following a tsunami warning. These evacuations were unique in that the normal protocol to transfer within the health system was not feasible due to their geographical isolation. The after action review process provided valuable insight to all stakeholders, who entered into discussions to ensure procedures, supplies, equipment and arrangements would be put in place to support the safe and effective evacuation of patients in the event of a future emergency. A key component of this process was the after action report, which captured key lessons learned and actionable items pertaining to five areas: evacuation locations, equipment and supplies, hospital unit/department evacuation plans, site evacuation plans, and exercising and validating plans. Following this format, each lesson is broken down into steps taken to achieve these goals, outlining best practices and lived experiences or highlighting gaps where further research is required and step-by-step guidance that can be adapted by emergency managers within the field of healthcare. Through this, pertinent strategies and considerations involved in the planning and execution in the evacuation of rural hospitals are also offered.

AB BACKGROUND: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to identify a broad range of pathogens in a single test.; METHODS: In a 1-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of metagenomic NGS of CSF for the diagnosis of infectious meningitis and encephalitis in hospitalized patients. All positive tests for pathogens on metagenomic NGS were confirmed by orthogonal laboratory testing. Physician feedback was elicited by teleconferences with a clinical microbial sequencing board and by surveys. Clinical effect was evaluated by retrospective chart review.; RESULTS: We enrolled 204 pediatric and adult patients at eight hospitals. Patients were severely ill: 48.5% had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and the 30-day mortality among all study patients was 11.3%. A total of 58 infections of the nervous system were diagnosed in 57 patients (27.9%). Among these 58 infections, metagenomic NGS identified 13 (22%) that were not identified by clinical testing at the source hospital. Among the remaining 45 infections (78%), metagenomic NGS made concurrent diagnoses in 19. Of the 26 infections not identified by metagenomic NGS, 11 were diagnosed by serologic testing only, 7 were diagnosed from tissue samples other than CSF, and 8 were negative on metagenomic NGS owing to low titers of pathogens in CSF. A total of 8 of 13 diagnoses made solely by metagenomic NGS had a likely clinical effect, with 7 of 13 guiding treatment.; CONCLUSIONS: Routine microbiologic testing is often insufficient to detect all neuroinvasive pathogens. In this study, metagenomic NGS of CSF obtained from patients with meningitis or encephalitis improved diagnosis of neurologic infections and provided actionable information in some cases.

AB The clinical efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for breast and colorectal cancer has greatly contributed to the improvement of patients' outcomes by individualizing their treatments according to their genomic background. However, primary or acquired resistance to treatment reduces its efficacy. In this context, the identification of biomarkers predictive of drug response would support research and development of new alternative treatments. Biomarkers play a major role in the genomic revolution, supporting disease diagnosis and treatment decision-making. Currently, several molecular biomarkers of treatment response for breast and colorectal cancer have been described. However, information on these biomarkers is scattered across several resources, and needs to be identified, collected and properly integrated to be fully exploited to inform monitoring of drug response in patients. Therefore, there is a need of resources that offer biomarker data in a harmonized manner to the user to support the identification of actionable biomarkers of response to treatment in cancer. ResMarkerDB was developed as a comprehensive resource of biomarkers of drug response in colorectal and breast cancer. It integrates data of biomarkers of drug response from existing repositories, and new data extracted and curated from the literature (referred as ResCur). ResMarkerDB currently features 266 biomarkers of diverse nature. Twenty-five percent of these biomarkers are exclusive of ResMarkerDB. Furthermore, ResMarkerDB is one of the few resources offering non-coding DNA data in response to drug treatment. The database contains more than 500 biomarker-drug-tumour associations, covering more than 100 genes. ResMarkerDB provides a web interface to facilitate the exploration of the current knowledge of biomarkers of response in breast and colorectal cancer. It aims to enhance translational research efforts in identifying actionable biomarkers of drug response in cancer. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB Background and aims: Current coverage of mental health care in low- and middle-income countries is limited, not only in terms of access to services but also in terms of financial protection of persons in need of care and treatment. This is especially pertinent considering the established relationship between mental illness and poverty and the need to ensure the financial risk protection of persons with mental disorders and their families as part of country's efforts to attain universal health coverage. This study set out to review the health and socio-economic contexts of Nigeria as well as to generate strategies for sustainable mental health financing that will be feasible, within the specific context of the country.; Methods: A multi-methods approach was developed and applied, consisting of three steps: a situational analysis of Nigeria's health system, macro-fiscal economic profile, and socio-political status, including a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of the Nigerian socio-economic, general and mental health context; key informant interviews with 12 expert stakeholders drawn from state and non-state actors in the health and financial sectors; and a policy analysis of sustainable financing options.; Results: Key challenges identified were: poor funding; reduced access to care, resulting in a huge treatment gap; and out of pocket payment for services-leading to impoverishment. Comprehensive coverage of mental health conditions within the ongoing health insurance reforms was identified as a key strategy for moving towards sustainable mental health financing in Nigeria. Other identified strategies include enhanced integration of mental health into primary care; incorporation of mental health into other strategic and currently funded programmes; adoption of performance-based financing measures; and renewed engagement with stakeholders, including external donor institutions.; Conclusions: A suite of feasible and actionable measures can be implemented to increase mental health service financing, reduce health-related financial burden on households, increase help-seeking and access to quality mental health care and, ultimately, reduce the large treatment and financing gap for mental disorders in Nigeria.

AB Aquatic telemetry technology generates new knowledge about the underwater world that can inform decision-making processes and thus can improve conservation and natural resource management. Still, there is lack of evidence on how telemetry-derived knowledge can or has informed management, and what factors facilitate or deter its use. We present one of the first quantitative studies related to the science-action gap and evaluate factors that influence the uptake of fish telemetry findings into policies and practices, as well as social acceptance of these findings. We globally surveyed 212 fish telemetry researchers regarding the knowledge uptake of an applied fish telemetry research project of their choice. Respondents' personal and professional attributes, as well as the attributes of their chosen projects, were analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify important factors that influenced the uptake (i.e., use, trust, and/or acceptance) of their findings. Researchers with extensive collaborations and who spent more time engaging in public outreach experienced greater uptake of their findings. Respondents with greater telemetry experience and commitment (e.g., more telemetry publications, higher proportion of research on fish telemetry) tended to achieve more social acceptance of their findings. Projects led by researchers who were highly involved and familiar with the fisheries management processes, and those where greater effort was devoted to research dissemination, also tended to experience greater uptake. Last, the levels of complexity and controversy of the issue addressed by the research project had a positive influence on the uptake of findings. The empirical results of this study support recent messages in the science practitioner literature for greater collaboration, knowledge co-production with partners, and public engagement to enable the transfer of knowledge and the use of evidence in decision-making and policies. Scientific organizations should consider shifting reward incentives to promote engagement and collaboration with non-scientific actors, and perhaps even rethinking hiring practices to consider personal and professional characteristics or attitudes such as altruism and networking skills given the influence of these factors in our model. Last, networks composed of both research and practice potentially have a key role in brokering and facilitating knowledge exchange and actions. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB Aim: This perspective is part of a series of articles that are outcomes of a consensus conference, that seek to offer a comprehensive examination of the clinical learning environment (CLE), using different academic disciplines and areas of focus termed "avenues." The education dimensions of the CLE are discussed in detail in this perspective, along with critical linkages to the other avenues. Methods: Using iterative presentations, discussion and small group work, in October 2018, the consensus conference participants explored the education, psychological, sociocultural, diversity and inclusion, digital and architectural aspects of the CLE. Results: The education avenue of the CLE includes elements of teaching and learning such as the curriculum, clinical experiences, the assessment system, educational program governance, trainee selection, faculty development, and program evaluation and improvement. Within the educational domain, we focus on organizational and personal/social aspects of the CLE, including (1) curriculum design and deployment, including placement of trainees in clinical settings, organizational culture, practices and policies, and accreditation and regulatory requirements from the organizational domain (2) the education system, including assessment, program evaluation and organization and governance; and (3) elements from the personal and social domains, including peer-to-peer, trainee-faculty, and trainee-patient relationships that influence how and what postgraduate trainees learn, trainee selection, informal and hidden curricula, and trainees' perceptions of their learning environment. Conclusions: We provide suggestions for further research and recommendations for addressing challenges and facilitating improvement in the educational aspects of the CLE, along with actionable practice points.

AB Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) enables genomic profiling of colorectal cancer. We investigated therapeutic targets by performing ctDNA panel-captured sequencing of 152 blood samples from advanced stage patients, from which somatic mutations and potentially actionable targets were evaluated. An additional 11 matched tissue samples were retrospectively obtained to verify target validity. The mutation frequencies of 1,127 collective genetic variants identified in our study strongly correlated with those of multiple public databases (Pearson R 2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001). The clonal fraction of driver genes was 90.3%, which was significantly higher than that of potential passenger genes (58.12%). Totally, 90 drug-sensitive genes from 56 patients (36.84%) were identified, including recurring targets PIK3CA, FBXW7, EGFR, BRAF, and NRAS Various resistance mechanisms of anti-EGFR antibodies were revealed via ctDNA profiling, with 29 patients individually exhibiting multiple mechanisms, suggesting considerable resistance heterogeneity in our study population. Of the matched tissue/blood pairs, 88.14% of tissue-derived mutations were detected in ctDNA, and 88.9% of actionable targets were validated. The mutational landscape of ctDNA was highly consistent with tissue databases, and ctDNA profiling showed favorable concordance with tumor tissues in our matched analysis. Thus, comprehensive ctDNA genotyping is a promising noninvasive alternative to biopsy-derived analysis for determining targeted therapy in advanced colorectal cancer. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Phosphorylation networks intimately regulate mechanisms of response to therapies. Mapping the phospho-catalytic profile of kinases in cells or tissues remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a practical high-throughput system to measure the enzymatic activity of kinases using biological peptide targets as phospho-sensors to reveal kinase dependencies in tumour biopsies and cell lines. A 228-peptide screen was developed to detect the activity of >60kinases, including ABLs, AKTs, CDKs and MAPKs. Focusing on BRAFV600E tumours, we found mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to BRAFV600E-targeted therapy in colorectal cancer, including targetable parallel activation of PDPK1 and PRKCA. Furthermore, mapping the phospho-catalytic signatures of melanoma specimens identifies RPS6KB1 and PIM1 as emerging druggable vulnerabilities predictive of poor outcome in BRAFV600E patients. The results show that therapeutic resistance can be caused by the concerted upregulation of interdependent pathways. Our kinase activity-mapping system is a versatile strategy that innovates the exploration of actionable kinases for precision medicine.

AB The clinical significance of BRAF alterations in well-differentiated (WD) metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (panNET) is unknown, but BRAF-mutated panNET could represent a subset characterized by an identifiable and clinically actionable driver. Following the identification of two patients with WD metastatic panNET whose tumors harbored BRAF mutations, we queried the MSK-IMPACT series of 80 patients with WD metastatic panNET for additional mutations in BRAF, and in other genes involved in RAS/ RTK/ PI3K signaling pathways. BRAF mutations were identified in six samples (7.5%): two tumors harbored V600E mutations, one tumor each expressed K601E, T599K, and T310I mutations, and one tumor expressed both G596D and E451K BRAF. Few additional actionable driver alterations were identified. To determine the ERK activating capability of four BRAF mutations not previously characterized, mutant constructs were tested in model systems. Biochemical characterization of BRAF mutations revealed both high and low activity mutants. Engineered cells expressing BRAF K601E and V600E were used for in vitro drug testing of RAF and MEK inhibitors currently in clinical use. BRAF K601E demonstrated reduced sensitivity to dabrafenib compared to BRAF V600E, but the combination of RAF plus MEK inhibition was effective in cells expressing this mutation. Herein, we describe the clinical course of a patient with BRAF K601E and a patient with BRAF V600E WD metastatic panNET, and the identification of four mutations in BRAF not previously characterized. The combined clinical and biochemical data support a potential role for RAF and MEK inhibitors, or a combination of these, in a selected panNET population.

AB RNA-Sequencing data offers an opportunity to enable precision medicine, but most methods rely on gene expression alone. To date, no methodology exists to identify and interpret alternative splicing patterns within pathways for an individual patient. This study develops methodology and conducts computational experiments to test the hypothesis that pathway aggregation of subject-specific alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) can inform upon disease mechanisms and predict survival. We propose the N-of-1-pathways Alternatively Spliced (N1PAS) method that takes an individual patient's paired-sample RNA-Seq isoform expression data (e.g., tumor vs. non-tumor, before-treatment vs. during-therapy) and pathway annotations as inputs. N1PAS quantifies the degree of alternative splicing via Hellinger distances followed by two-stage clustering to determine pathway enrichment. We provide a clinically relevant "odds ratio" along with statistical significance to quantify pathway enrichment. We validate our method in clinical samples and find that our method selects relevant pathways (p < 0.05 in 4/6 data sets). Extensive Monte Carlo studies show N1PAS powerfully detects pathway enrichment of ASGs while adequately controlling false discovery rates. Importantly, our studies also unveil highly heterogeneous single-subject alternative splicing patterns that cohort-based approaches overlook. Finally, we apply our patient-specific results to predict cancer survival (FDR < 20%) while providing diagnostics in pursuit of translating transcriptome data into clinically actionable information.

AB Interest in the use of simulation for acquiring, maintaining, and assessing skills in GI endoscopy has grown over the past decade, as evidenced by recent American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines encouraging the use of endoscopy simulation training and its incorporation into training standards by a key accreditation organization. An EndoVators Summit, partially supported by a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health, (NIH) was held at the ASGE Institute for Training and Technology from November 19 to 20, 2017. The summit brought together over 70 thought leaders in simulation research and simulator development and key decision makers from industry. Proceedings opened with a historical review of the role of simulation in medicine and an outline of priority areas related to the emerging role of simulation training within medicine broadly. Subsequent sessions addressed the summit's purposes: to review the current state of endoscopy simulation and the role it could play in endoscopic training, to define the role and value of simulators in the future of endoscopic training and to reach consensus regarding priority areas for simulation-related education and research and simulator development. This white paper provides an overview of the central points raised by presenters, synthesizes the discussions on the key issues under consideration, and outlines actionable items and/or areas of consensus reached by summit participants and society leadership pertinent to each session. The goal was to provide a working roadmap for the developers of simulators, the investigators who strive to define the optimal use of endoscopy-related simulation and assess its impact on educational outcomes and health care quality, and the educators who seek to enhance integration of simulation into training and practice.

AB Logistics and (cost-)effectiveness of pharmacogenetic (PGx)-testing may be optimized when delivered through a pre-emptive panel-based approach, within a clinical decision support system (CDSS). Here, clinical recommendations are automatically deployed by the CDSS when a drug-gene interaction (DGI) is encountered. However, this requires record of PGx-panel results in the electronic medical record (EMR). Several studies indicate promising clinical utility of panel-based PGx-testing in polypharmacy and psychiatry, but is undetermined in primary care. Therefore, we aim to quantify both the feasibility and the real-world impact of this approach in primary care. Within a prospective pilot study, community pharmacists were provided the opportunity to request a panel of eight pharmacogenes to guide drug dispensing within a CDSS for 200 primary care patients. In this side-study, this cohort was cross-sectionally followed-up after a mean of 2.5-years. PGx-panel results were successfully recorded in 96% and 68% of pharmacist and general practitioner (GP) EMRs, respectively. This enabled 97% of patients to (re)use PGx-panel results for at least one, and 33% for up to four newly initiated prescriptions with possible DGIs. A total of 24.2% of these prescriptions had actionable DGIs, requiring pharmacotherapy adjustment. Healthcare utilization seemed not to vary among those who did and did not encounter a DGI. Pre-emptive panel-based PGx-testing is feasible and real-world impact is substantial in primary care.

AB As epigenetic studies become more common and lead to new insights into health and disease, the return of individual epigenetic results to research participants, in particular in large-scale epigenomic studies, will be of growing importance. Members of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) Bioethics Workgroup considered the potential ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) involved in returning epigenetic research results and incidental findings in order to produce a set of 'Points-to-consider' (P-t-C) for the epigenetics research community. These P-t-C draw on existing guidance on the return of genetic research results, while also integrating the IHEC Bioethics Workgroup's ELSI research on and discussion of the issues associated with epigenetic data as well as the experience of a return of results pilot study by the Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK). Major challenges include how to determine the clinical validity and actionability of epigenetic results, and considerations related to environmental exposures and epigenetic marks, including circumstances warranting the sharing of results with family members and third parties. Interdisciplinary collaboration and good public communication regarding epigenetic risk will be important to advance the return of results framework for epigenetic science.

AB Objectives: Consumers rely on online health information, particularly for unusual conditions. Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) are complex with some aspects of care controversial. Accurate web-based DSD information is essential for decision-making, but the quality has not been rigorously evaluated. The purpose of the present study was to assess the quality of online health information related to DSD presented by 12 pediatric institutions comprising the NIH-sponsored DSD-Translational Research Network (DSD-TRN).; Methods: DSD-TRN sites identified team webpages, then we identified linked webpages. We also used each institution search engine to search common DSD terms. We assessed webpages using validated tools: the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) determined reading level, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) evaluated content for understandability and actionability, and the DISCERN tool assessed treatment decision-making information (for hormone replacement and surgery). We developed a "Completeness" measure which assessed the presence of information on 25 DSD topics.; Results: The SMOG reading level of webpages was at or above high-school grade level. Mean (SD) PEMAT understandability score for Team Pages and Team Links was 68% (6%); on average these pages met less than 70% of the understandability criteria. Mean (SD) PEMAT actionability score was 23% (20%); few patient actions were identified. The DISCERN tool determined that the quality of information related to hormone treatment and to surgery was poor. Sites' webpages covered 12-56% of the items on our Completeness measure.; Conclusions: Quality of DSD online content was poor, and would be improved by using a variety of strategies, such as simplifying word choice, using visual aids, highlighting actions patients can take and acknowledging areas of uncertainty. For complex conditions such as DSD, high-quality web-based information is essential to empower patients (and caregiver proxies), particularly when aspects of care are controversial.

AB PURPOSE: Ductal prostate cancer (dPC) is a rare variant of prostatic adenocarcinoma associated with poor outcomes. Although its histopathologic features are well characterized, the underlying molecular hallmarks of this aggressive subtype are not well described. We sought to provide a comprehensive overview of the spectrum of mutations associated with dPC.; METHODS: Three case series across multiple institutions were assembled. All patients had a diagnosis of dPC, and histopathologic classification was confirmed by an expert genitourinary pathologist. Case series 1 included men who were prospectively enrolled in a tumor sequencing study at the University of Washington (n = 22). Case series 2 and 3 included archival samples from men treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital (n = 21) and University of Calgary (n = 8), respectively. Tumor tissue was sequenced on a targeted next-generation sequencing assay, UW-OncoPlex, according to previously published methods. The frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations are reported.; RESULTS: Overall, 25 patients (49%) had at least one DNA damage repair gene alteration, including seven (14%) with a mismatch repair gene mutation and 16 (31%) with a homologous repair mutation. Germline autosomal dominant mutations were confirmed or suspected in 10 patients (20%). Activating mutations in the PI3K pathway (n = 19; 37%), WNT pathway (n = 16; 31%), and MAPK pathway (n = 8; 16%) were common.; CONCLUSION: This study strongly suggests that dPCs are enriched for actionable mutations, with approximately 50% of patients demonstrating DNA damage repair pathway alteration(s). Patients with dPC should be offered next-generation sequencing to guide standard-of-care treatment (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors) or triaged toward an appropriate clinical trial (eg, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors).

AB Discovery of new actionable targets and functional networks in melanoma is an urgent need as only a fraction of metastatic patients achieves durable clinical benefit by targeted therapy or immunotherapy approaches. Here we show that NFATc2 expression is associated with an EMT-like transcriptional program and with an invasive melanoma phenotype, as shown by analysis of melanoma cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels, interrogation of the TCGA melanoma dataset and characterization of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry. Gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition of NFATc2 downregulated EMT-related genes and AXL, and suppressed c-Myc, FOXM1, and EZH2. Targeting of c-Myc suppressed FOXM1 and EZH2, while targeting of FOXM1 suppressed EZH2. Inhibition of c-Myc, or FOXM1, or EZH2 downregulated EMT-related gene expression, upregulated MITF and suppressed migratory and invasive activity of neoplastic cells. Stable silencing of NFATc2 impaired melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in SCID mice. In NFATc2+ EZH2+ melanoma cell lines pharmacological co-targeting of NFATc2 and EZH2 exerted strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity, irrespective of BRAF or NRAS mutations and of BRAF inhibitor resistance. These results provide preclinical evidence for a role of NFATc2 in shaping the EMT-like melanoma phenotype and reveal a targetable vulnerability associated with NFATc2 and EZH2 expression in melanoma cells belonging to different mutational subsets.

AB The landscape of treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved dramatically over the past 3 decades. A better understanding of the disease biology and identification of actionable genetic alterations heralded an era of targeted therapies that has led to unprecedented survival benefits in patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC. More recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors that have changed the treatment paradigm for patients with advanced NSCLC because of their ability to produce durable responses, resulting in improved survival outcomes. Despite the unparalleled success of these agents, primary and acquired resistance to these therapies pose a formidable challenge. In this article, we provide an overview of the therapeutic advances in the treatment of NSCLC, mechanisms of resistance, and potential strategies to overcome resistance to targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

AB Personalized therapy based on actionable molecular markers has completely transformed the therapeutic landscape in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In less than 15 years, multiple molecular targets, led by EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), have been identified, and myriad oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now available to target these oncogenic drivers, with the expectation that the majority of patients will respond to treatment and that progression-free survival (PFS) will exceed 10 to 30 months, far better than we observed historically with chemotherapy alone. As a result, prognosis has improved dramatically in this subset of patients. Osimertinib has largely displaced first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. PFS now exceeds 18 months, and central nervous system penetrance is enhanced. Dacomitinib has the distinction of being the first EGFR TKI to demonstrate a survival advantage compared with older TKIs. Recent data suggest therapeutic additivity, if not synergy, for the concurrent use of chemotherapy, as well as monoclonal antibodies targeting angiogenesis, with EGFR TKIs. Alectinib and brigatinib, very specific ALK inhibitors, have proven superior to the erstwhile standard crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK+ NSCLC; PFS now routinely exceeds 2 to 3 years. In addition, these newer agents have far superior central nervous system penetration. As a result, many patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC with brain metastases, even some who are symptomatic, can defer or indefinitely avoid brain irradiation. Mechanisms of resistance in ALK are complicated, with multiple new agents being developed in this arena. Although many patients with molecular targets can reasonably expect to live 5 years or more, the emergence of molecular resistance is virtually inevitable. In this regard, systemic platinum-based chemotherapy is the final common therapeutic pathway for virtually all patients with oncogenic drivers. Standard regimens include pemetrexed and carboplatin, as well as the E4599 regimen, combination solvent-based paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab. Checkpoint inhibitors, as single agents, have not yielded much benefit, even in those with high levels of PD-L1 expression. However, in a subanalysis of patients with ALK and EGFR mutations enrolled in IMpower150, the addition of atezolizumab to the E4599 regimen led to a major overall survival benefit (hazard ratio < 0.40). In the absence of systemic chemotherapy, combining checkpoint inhibitors with TKIs in this setting remains investigational; several studies have demonstrated untoward pulmonary and hepatic toxicity.

AB INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The prevalence and incidence of chronic liver disease is increasing resulting, in substantial direct and indirect medical costs. Overuse of investigations, treatments and procedures contribute to rising health care costs and can expose patients to unnecessary harm and delay in receiving care. The Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) campaign has encouraged professional societies to develop statements that are directly actionable by their members in an effort to promote higher-value health care that will lead to downstream effect on how other practitioners make decisions.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL) established its Choosing Wisely top five list of recommendations using the framework put forward by CWC. CASL convened a task force that developed a list of draft recommendations and shared this with CASL membership electronically with eventual ranking of the top five recommendations by consensus at Canadian Digestives Disease Week (CDDW) 2017. Following revisions, the CASL Executive Committee endorsed the final list, which was disseminated online by CWC (July 2017).; RESULTS: The top five recommendations physicians and patients should question include: 1) Don't order serum ammonia to diagnose or manage hepatic encephalopathy (HE). 2) Don't routinely transfuse fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, or platelets to reverse abnormal tests of coagulation in patients with cirrhosis prior to abdominal paracentesis, endoscopic variceal band ligation, or any other minor invasive procedures. 3) Don't order HFE genotyping based on serum ferritin values alone to diagnose hereditary hemochromatosis. 4) Don't perform computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) routinely to monitor benign focal liver lesions. 5) Don't repeat hepatitis C viral load testing in an individual who has established chronic infection, outside of anti-viral treatment.; CONCLUSION: The Choosing Wisely recommendations will foster patient-physician discussions, reduce unnecessary treatment and testing, avert adverse effects from testing and treatment along with reducing medical expenditure in hepatology.

AB Indigenous populations often have poorer health outcomes than the general population. Marginalization, colonization, and migration from traditional lands have all affected traditional medicine usage, health access, and indigenous health equity. An in-depth understanding of health for specific populations is essential to develop actionable insights into contributing factors to poor indigenous health. To develop a more complete, nuanced understanding of indigenous health status, we conducted first-person interviews with both the indigenous Baka and neighboring Bantu villagers (the reference population in the region), as well as local clinicians in Southern Cameroon. These interviews elucidated perspectives on the most pressing challenges to health and assets to health for both groups, including access to health services, causes of illness, the uses and values of traditional versus modern medicine, and community resilience during severe health events. Baka interviewees, in particular, reported facing health challenges due to affordability and discrimination in public health centers, health effects due to migration from their traditional lands, and a lack of culturally appropriate public health services.

AB BACKGROUND: The subtyping of breast cancer based on features of tumour biology such as hormonal receptor and HER2 status has led to increasingly patient-specific treatment and thus improved outcomes. However, such subgroups may not be sufficiently informed to best predict outcome and/or treatment response. The incorporation of multi-modal data may identify unexpected and actionable subgroups to enhance disease understanding and improve outcomes.; METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study used the cancer registry Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), which represents 28% of the U.S. population. We included adult female patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Latent class analysis (LCA), a data-driven technique, was used to identify clinically homogeneous subgroups ("endophenotypes") of breast cancer from receptor status (hormonal receptor and HER2), clinical, and demographic data and each subgroup was explored using Bayesian networks.; RESULTS: Included were 44,346 patients, 1257 (3%) of whom had distant organ metastases at diagnosis. Four endophenotypes were identified with LCA: 1) "Favourable biology" had entirely local disease with favourable biology, 2) "HGHR-" had the highest incidence of HR- receptor status and highest grade but few metastases and relatively good outcomes, 3) "HR+ bone" had isolated bone metastases and uniform receptor status (HR+/HER2-), and 4) "Distant organ spread" had high metastatic burden and poor survival. Bayesian networks revealed clinically intuitive interactions between patient and disease features.; CONCLUSIONS: We have identified four distinct subgroups of breast cancer using LCA, including one unexpected group with good outcomes despite having the highest average histologic grade and rate of HR- tumours. Deeper understanding of subgroup characteristics can allow us to 1) identify actionable group properties relating to disease biology and patient features and 2) develop group-specific diagnostics and treatments.

AB Many gene fusions are reported in tumours and for most their role remains unknown. As fusions are used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and are targets for treatment, it is crucial to assess their function in cancer. To systematically investigate the role of fusions in tumour cell fitness, we utilized RNA-sequencing data from 1011 human cancer cell lines to functionally link 8354 fusion events with genomic data, sensitivity to>350 anti-cancer drugs and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-fitness effects. Established clinically-relevant fusions were identified. Overall, detection of functional fusions was rare, including those involving cancer driver genes, suggesting that many fusions are dispensable for tumour fitness. Therapeutically actionable fusions involving RAF1, BRD4 and ROS1 were verified in new histologies. In addition, recurrent YAP1-MAML2 fusions were identified as activators of Hippo-pathway signaling in multiple cancer types. Our approach discriminates functional fusions, identifying new drivers of carcinogenesis and fusions that could have clinical implications.

AB Objective: To develop a methodology to assess electronic immunization registries (EIRs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Latin America and the Caribbean.; Methods: A team from the Immunization Unit at the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reviewed existing methodologies to evaluate health information systems, particularly the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework and methodologies used to assess information systems. In 2014, the PAHO team convened a small working group to develop an evaluation approach to be added to the existing World Health Organization immunization data quality self-assessment (DQS) tool. The resulting DQS with an added EIR component was named "DQS Plus." The DQS Plus methodology was used in Panama in May 2014 and in Honduras in November 2015.; Results: The DQS Plus tool proved feasible and easy to implement in Panama and Honduras, including by not adding much time or resources to those needed for a usual DQS. The information obtained from the DQS Plus assessment was practical and helped provide health authorities with recommendations to update and improve their EIR, strengthen the use of the registry, and enhance the data the assessment produced, at all levels of the health system. These recommendations are currently being implemented in the two countries.; Conclusions: The DQS Plus proved to be a practical and useful approach for assessing an EIR in an LMIC and generating actionable recommendations. Further work on defining operational and related EIR functional standards in LMICs will help develop an improved EIR assessment tool for Latin America and the Caribbean, and potentially elsewhere.

   La metodologia de DQS Plus se uso en Panama en mayo del 2014 y en
   Honduras en noviembre del 2015.Resultados: Se demostro que la
   herramienta DQS Plus fue factible y facil de aplicar en Panama y
   Honduras, entre otras cosas por no requerir mucho tiempo ni recursos
   adicionales a los necesarios para la DQS ordinaria. La informacion
   obtenida mediante la evaluacion con DQS Plus fue practica y contribuyo a
   proporcionar a las autoridades sanitarias las recomendaciones para
   actualizar y mejorar sus registros de inmunizacion electronicos,
   fortalecer el uso del registro y mejorar los datos que arrojo la
   evaluacion, a todos los niveles del sistema de salud. En la actualidad
   estan poniendose en practica dichas recomendaciones en los dos
   paises.Conclusiones: Se demostro que DQS Plus es una estrategia practica
   y util para evaluar un registro de inmunizacion electronico en los
   paises de ingresos bajos y medianos y generar recomendaciones
   aplicables. El trabajo ulterior para definir las normas operativas y
   funcionales de los registros de inmunizacion electronicos en los paises
   de ingresos bajos y medianos contribuira a crear una mejor herramienta
   de evaluacion de dichos registros en America Latina y el Caribe, y
   posiblemente en otros sitios.Objetivo: Elaborar uma metodologia para

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) supports blood-based genomic profiling but is not yet routinely implemented in the setting of a phase I trials clinic. TARGET is a molecular profiling program with the primary aim to match patients with a broad range of advanced cancers to early phase clinical trials on the basis of analysis of both somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) across a 641 cancer-associated-gene panel in a single ctDNA assay. For the first 100 TARGET patients, ctDNA data showed good concordance with matched tumor and results were turned round within a clinically acceptable timeframe for Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) review. When a 2.5% variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold was applied, actionable mutations were identified in 41 of 100 patients, and 11 of these patients received a matched therapy. These data support the application of ctDNA in this early phase trial setting where broad genomic profiling of contemporaneous tumor material enhances patient stratification to novel therapies and provides a practical template for bringing routinely applied blood-based analyses to the clinic.

AB Precision health relies on the ability to assess disease risk at an individual level, detect early preclinical conditions and initiate preventive strategies. Recent technological advances in omics and wearable monitoring enable deep molecular and physiological profiling and may provide important tools for precision health. We explored the ability of deep longitudinal profiling to make health-related discoveries, identify clinically relevant molecular pathways and affect behavior in a prospective longitudinal cohort (n=109) enriched for risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The cohort underwent integrative personalized omics profiling from samples collected quarterly for up to 8years (median, 2.8years) using clinical measures and emerging technologies including genome, immunome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome and wearable monitoring. We discovered more than 67 clinically actionable health discoveries and identified multiple molecular pathways associated with metabolic, cardiovascular and oncologic pathophysiology. We developed prediction models for insulin resistance by using omics measurements, illustrating their potential to replace burdensome tests. Finally, study participation led the majority of participants to implement diet and exercise changes. Altogether, we conclude that deep longitudinal profiling can lead to actionable health discoveries and provide relevant information for precision health.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patient and procedure verification, or the time-out process (TOP), is considered one of the most vital components of patient safety. It has long been a focus of intervention in the surgical community and recently was incorporated into the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines for safety in the GI endoscopy unit. The TOP has had limited attention in the endoscopy literature but remains an area for improvement in clinical endoscopy practice. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and improve TOP compliance rates in our endoscopy unit using remote video auditing (RVA).; METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, pilot initiative in an endoscopy unit at a tertiary care academic medical center. Video cameras with offsite monitoring were installed in each procedure room in our endoscopy suite in November 2016. Baseline TOP compliance rates were audited with RVA over a 2-month period. A multidisciplinary quality improvement team reviewed the data, identified barriers to the TOP, and implemented actionable items in January 2017. TOP compliance rates were again monitored via RVA, and data were collected through October 2018. Pre- and postintervention TOP compliance rates were compared.; RESULTS: Over the baseline period, 692 procedures were audited and TOP compliance documented. Baseline TOP compliance rate was 69.6%. Identifiable barriers to TOP compliance included a lack of designated team member to lead TOP, inconsistent documentation of TOP, irrelevant safety checklist items not applicable to endoscopic procedures, and lack of patient safety culture. Actionable items implemented in response to these barriers included designation of a TOP leader, visual indication of initiation of TOP, creation of a concise endoscopy-specific safety checklist, and formal notification/education of the entire endoscopy team. Postintervention TOP compliance rates were then audited from January 2017 to October 2018 and included 12,008 procedures. The mean TOP compliance rate significantly improved from baseline (95.3% vs 69.6%; 95% confidence interval, 22.4-29.3; P< .0001). Additionally, the improvement was maintained throughout the entire postintervention observation period.; CONCLUSIONS: TOP compliance rates significantly improved in our endoscopy unit through the use of RVA and implementation of 4 actionable items. Future studies should evaluate the reproducibility of this method in other endoscopy units. Copyright © 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The nature of the tumor antigens that are detectable by T cells remains unclear. In melanoma, T cells were shown to react against major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-associated peptides (MAPs) that are derived from exonic mutations. A recent multi-omic study of hepatocellular carcinomas suggests, however, that mutated exonic MAPs were exceedingly rare, bringing the accuracy of the current methods for antigen identification into question and demonstrating the importance of broadening tumor-antigen discovery efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: Prompted by the revolution in high-throughput sequencing and its potential impact for treating cancer patients, we initiated a clinical research study to compare the ability of different sequencing assays and analysis methods to analyze glioblastoma tumors and generate real-time potential treatment options for physicians.; METHODS: A consortium of seven institutions in New York City enrolled 30 patients with glioblastoma and performed tumor whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq; collectively WGS/RNA-seq); 20 of these patients were also analyzed with independent targeted panel sequencing. We also compared results of expert manual annotations with those from an automated annotation system, Watson Genomic Analysis (WGA), to assess the reliability and time required to identify potentially relevant pharmacologic interventions.; RESULTS: WGS/RNAseq identified more potentially actionable clinical results than targeted panels in 90% of cases, with an average of 16-fold more unique potentially actionable variants identified per individual; 84 clinically actionable calls were made using WGS/RNA-seq that were not identified by panels. Expert annotation and WGA had good agreement on identifying variants [mean sensitivity=0.71, SD=0.18 and positive predictive value (PPV)=0.80, SD=0.20] and drug targets when the same variants were called (mean sensitivity=0.74, SD=0.34 and PPV=0.79, SD=0.23) across patients. Clinicians used the information to modify their treatment plan 10% of the time.; CONCLUSION: These results present the first comprehensive comparison of technical and machine augmented analysis of targeted panel and WGS/RNA-seq to identify potential cancer treatments.

AB Over the past two decades, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty have been striving to make their teaching practices more inclusive and welcoming to the variety of students who enter college. However, many STEM faculty, even those at teaching-focused institutions, have been educated in a traditional environment that emphasizes research and may not include classroom teaching. This can produce a deficit in training that leaves many STEM faculty feeling uncertain about inclusive teaching practices and their essential undergirding principles. This essay describes an online, evidence-based teaching guide ( https://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/inclusive-teaching ) intended to help fill this gap, serving as a resource for science faculty as they work to become more inclusive, particular with regard to differences in race, ethnicity, and gender. The guide describes the importance of developing self-awareness and empathy for students as a precursor to considering classroom practices. It also explores the role of classroom climate before turning to pedagogical choices that can support students' sense of belonging, competence, and interest in the course. Finally, the guide suggests that true inclusivity is a community effort and that instructors should leverage local and national networks to maximize student learning and inclusion. Each of these essential points is supported by summaries of and links to articles that can inform these choices. The guide also includes an instructor checklist that offers a concise summary of key points with actionable steps that can guide instructors as they work toward a more inclusive practice. We hope that the guide will provide value for both faculty who are just beginning to consider how to change their teaching practices and faculty seeking to enrich their current efforts.

AB Nutrition is an interdisciplinary science that studies the interactions of nutrients with the body in relation to maintenance of health and well-being. Nutrition is highly complex due to the underlying various internal and external factors that could model it. Thus, hacking this complexity requires more holistic and network-based strategies that could unveil these dynamic system interactions at both time and space scales. The ongoing omics era with its high-throughput molecular data generation is paving the way to embrace this complexity and is deeply reshaping the whole field of nutrition. Understanding the future paths of nutrition science is of importance from both translational and clinical perspectives. Basic nutrients which might include metabolites are important in nutrition science. Moreover, metabolites are key biological communication channels and represent an appealing functional readout at the interface of different major influential factors that define health and disease. Metabolomics is the technology that enables holistic and systematic analyses of metabolites in a biological system. Hence, given its intrinsic functionality, its tight connection to metabolism and its high clinical actionability potential, metabolomics is a very appealing technology for nutrition science. The ultimate goal is to deliver a tailored and clinically relevant nutritional recommendations and interventions to achieve precision nutrition. This work intends to present an update on the applications of metabolomics to personalize nutrition in translational and clinical settings. It also discusses the current conceptual shifts that are remodeling clinical nutrition practices in this Precision Medicine era. Finally, perspectives of clinical nutrition in the ever-growing, data-driven healthcare landscape are presented.

AB Currently, genomic characterization has become standard of care for tumor types such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. A deep understanding of genomic alterations in different tumor types would help identify potentially actionable genomic changes which occur across a wide variety of tumor types. A basket trial is a new type of clinical trial for which eligibility is based on the presence of a specific genomic alteration, irrespective of histology. Basket trials are phase II screening trials for the off-label use of a targeted drug in patients with the same genomic alterations for which it was approved. Intractable cancer refers to a type or condition of cancer which is unresponsive or resistant to treatment; intractable cancers may be classified into five subtypes as follows: hard-to-treat condition of common advanced cancer after multiple-line therapy, rare cancer in which no standard of care has been recommended, advanced cancer in which standard of care does not work well, cancer accompanied with organ dysfunction, and cancers in older or younger cancer patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that in basket trials, genomic-guided therapy yields clinical benefits in intractable cancer, thereby providing novel insights into the optimal clinical management of such cancers. In this review, we describe a novel way to classify intractable cancer, and summarize the current knowledge on such cancers. We additionally provide information on the role of basket trials in intractable cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: The Antimicrobial Use (AU) Option of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) is a surveillance resource that can provide actionable data for antibiotic stewardship programs. Such data are used to enable measurements of AU across hospitals and before, during, and after stewardship interventions.; METHODS: We used monthly AU data and annual facility survey data submitted to the NHSN to describe hospitals and neonatal patient care locations reporting to the AU Option in 2017, examine frequencies of most commonly reported agents, and analyze variability in AU rates across hospitals and levels of care. We used results from these analyses in a collaborative project with Vermont Oxford Network to develop neonatal-specific Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR) agent categories and neonatal-specific NHSN Annual Hospital Survey questions.; RESULTS: As of April 1, 2018, 351 US hospitals had submitted data to the AU Option from at least 1 neonatal unit. In 2017, ampicillin and gentamicin were the most frequently reported antimicrobial agents. On average, total rates of AU were highest in level III NICUs, followed by special care nurseries, level II-III NICUs, and well newborn nurseries. Seven antimicrobial categories for neonatal SAARs were created, and 6 annual hospital survey questions were developed.; CONCLUSIONS: A small but growing percentage of US hospitals have submitted AU data from neonatal patient care locations to NHSN, enabling the use of AU data aggregated by NHSN as benchmarks for neonatal antimicrobial stewardship programs and further development of the SAAR summary measure for neonatal AU.

AB Purpose: Genomic alterations in blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with colorectal cancers were correlated with clinical outcomes.; Patients and Methods: Next-generation sequencing of ctDNA (54- to 73-gene panel) was performed in 94 patients with colorectal cancer.; Results: Most patients (96%) had metastatic or recurrent disease at the time of blood draw. The median number of nonsynonymous alterations per patient was three (range, zero to 30). The most frequently aberrant genes were TP53 (52.1% of patients), KRAS (34%), and APC (28.7%). Concordance between tissue and blood next-generation sequencing ranged from 63.2% (APC) to 85.5% (BRAF). Altogether, 74 patients (79%) had one or more nonsynonymous alterations, 69 (73%) had one or more potentially actionable alterations, and 61 (65%) had an alteration actionable by a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (on or off label). Lung metastases correlated with improved survival from diagnosis in univariable analysis. ctDNA of 5% or more from blood tests as well as EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) nonsynonymous alterations correlated with worse survival (but only ERBB2 remained significant in multivariable analysis). No two patients had identical molecular portfolios. Overall, 65% versus 31% of patients treated with matched (n = 17) versus unmatched therapy (n = 18) after ctDNA testing achieved stable disease for 6 months or more, partial response, or complete response (P = .045); progression-free survival, 6.1 versus 2.3 months (P = .08); and survival not reached versus 9.4 months (P = .146; all by multivariable analysis).; Conclusion: Patients with colorectal cancer have heterogeneous ctDNA profiles, and most harbor potentially actionable ctDNA alterations. Matched therapy yielded higher rates of stable disease for 6 months or more, partial response, or complete response. ctDNA assessment may have clinical utility and merits further investigation.

AB Background: HER2 antagonists have marked activity and are approved for the treatment of HER2 overexpressing breast and gastric cancers. Recent studies have shown that ERBB2 (HER2) gene amplification and overexpression may also be actionable in other tumor types. Inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in HER2 status, however, poses a significant challenge in identifying patients that may benefit from HER2-targeted therapies. ERBB2 amplification as identified by circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which circumvents tissue heterogeneity issues, is emerging as a robust biomarker predictive of response to anti-HER2 agents. Here, the prevalence and genomic landscape of ERBB2 alterations detectable by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cfDNA was evaluated in a large cohort of Asian patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods: Results were queried for consecutive patients (n = 469) tested by a comprehensive 70/73-gene cfDNA NGS assay (Guardant360) between November 2015 and June 2018. Patients with ERBB2 gene alterations including copy number amplifications (CNAs), single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and insertion-deletions (indels) were identified. Results: ERBB2 alterations were detected in 52 patients (11.1%); ERBB2 SNVs, CNAs, and indels were found in 27 (5.8%), 27 (5.8%), and 10 (2.1%) patients, respectively. ERBB2 amplification was most frequently identified in gastric (21.4%; 6/28), colorectal (11.1%; 5/45), lung (3.9%; 9/231), and breast (3.2%; 1/31) cancer patients. ERBB2 amplification was often mutually exclusive with other oncogenic alterations in gastric (83.3%; 5/6) and colorectal (60%; 3/5) cancer patients. ERBB2 copy number gains were also highest in gastric and colorectal cancers (median 4.8 and 6.6, respectively). We further report two cases of advanced gastric cancer patients, one treatment naive, and the other having failed four lines of therapy, whose ERBB2 CNAs were identified by cfDNA and derived clinical benefit from HER2-based therapies. Conclusion: Our data indicate that ERBB2 amplification is a common event in solid tumors among Asian cancer patients. High ERBB2 incidence and copy number gains were observed in gastric and colorectal cancer patients, often in the absence of other oncogenic mutations, underscoring its likely role as the driver alteration in those settings. Finally, we show the potential of comprehensive cfDNA testing in identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from HER2-targeted therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: Audit and feedback (A&F) is a common quality improvement strategy with highly variable effects on patient care. It is unclear how A&F effectiveness can be maximised. Since the core mechanism of action of A&F depends on drawing attention to a discrepancy between actual and desired performance, we aimed to understand current and best practices in the choice of performance comparator.; METHODS: We described current choices for performance comparators by conducting a secondary review of randomised trials of A&F interventions and identifying the associated mechanisms that might have implications for effective A&F by reviewing theories and empirical studies from a recent qualitative evidence synthesis.; RESULTS: We found across 146 trials that feedback recipients' performance was most frequently compared against the performance of others (benchmarks; 60.3%). Other comparators included recipients' own performance over time (trends; 9.6%) and target standards (explicit targets; 11.0%), and 13% of trials used a combination of these options. In studies featuring benchmarks, 42% compared against mean performance. Eight (5.5%) trials provided a rationale for using a specific comparator. We distilled mechanisms of each comparator from 12 behavioural theories, 5 randomised trials, and 42 qualitative A&F studies.; CONCLUSION: Clinical performance comparators in published literature were poorly informed by theory and did not explicitly account for mechanisms reported in qualitative studies. Based on our review, we argue that there is considerable opportunity to improve the design of performance comparators by (1) providing tailored comparisons rather than benchmarking everyone against the mean, (2) limiting the amount of comparators being displayed while providing more comparative information upon request to balance the feedback's credibility and actionability, (3) providing performance trends but not trends alone, and (4) encouraging feedback recipients to set personal, explicit targets guided by relevant information.

AB PURPOSE: Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) show high rates of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IOs). B2M mutations and protein loss have been proposed as causes of resistance to IOs, yet they are enriched in MSI-H CRC. We aimed to characterize B2M-mutant, IO-naive CRC.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: All CRCs with results for Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets, a next-generation sequencing assay that interrogates > 400 genes for mutations as well as MSI status, were surveyed for B2M mutations. All B2M-mutant CRCs were assessed for expression of B2M, major histocompatibility complex class I, and programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) via immunohistochemistry and average CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte counts against a control group of MSI-H B2M wild-type CRCs.; RESULTS: Fifty-nine (3.4%) of 1,751 patients with CRC harbored B2M mutations, with 84% (77 of 92) of the mutations predicted to be truncating. B2M mutations were significantly enriched in MSI-H CRCs, with 44 (24%) of 182 MSI-H CRCs harboring B2M mutations (P < .001). Thirty-two of 44 B2M-mutant CRCs with available material (73%) had complete loss of B2M expression, whereas all 26 CRCs with wild-type B2M retained expression (P < .001). B2M mutation status was not associated with major histocompatibility complex class I expression, KRAS or BRAF mutation, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte level, or PD-L1 expression after adjustment for MSI status. Of 13 patients with B2M-mutant CRC who received programmed death-1 or PD-L1 IOs, 11 (85%) achieved clinical benefit, defined as stable disease or partial response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.; CONCLUSION: B2M mutations occur in approximately 24% of MSI-H CRCs and are usually associated with loss of B2M expression. Most patients with B2M-mutant MSI-H CRC with loss of protein expression obtain clinical benefit from IOs.

AB BACKGROUND: Parents of preterm infants increasingly use their mobile phone to search for health information. In a recent review, websites targeted toward parents with infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were found to have poor to moderate quality educational material; however, there is a dearth of literature regarding mobile apps for NICU parents.; OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and evaluate apps targeting parents of infants in the NICU for quality of information, usability, and credibility.; METHODS: We systematically searched the Apple App Store and Google Play using 49 key terms (eg, "preterm infant") from July 26 to August 18, 2017. English apps targeting NICU parents that cost less than $20 were included. Apps for health care professionals, e-books/magazines, or nonrelevant results were excluded. In total, 3 tools were used for evaluation: Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) to measure quality; Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-AV) to measure the app's content usability; and Trust it or Trash It to measure credibility.; RESULTS: The initial search yielded 6579 apps, with 49 apps eligible after title and description screening. In total, 27 apps met the eligibility criteria with 9 apps available in both app stores; of those, the app with the most recent update date was chosen to be included in the analysis. Thus, 18 unique apps were included for final analysis. Using MARS, 7 apps (7/18, 39%) received a good score on overall quality (ie, 4.0 out of 5.0), with none receiving an excellent score. In addition, 8 apps (8/18, 44%) received a PEMAT-AV score between 51% and 75% on the understandability subscale, and 8 apps (8/18, 44%) scored between 76% and 100% on the actionability subscale. Trust It or Trash It deemed 13 apps (13/18, 72%) as trash for reasons including no identification of sources or lack of current information, with only 5 (5/18, 28%) deemed trustworthy. Reviewer's expert evaluation found 16 apps contained content that matched information provided by multiple sources; however, most apps did not meet other objective measurement items to support credibility. When comparing the MARS overall quality and subjective quality scores with trustworthiness of apps, there was no statistically significant difference. A statistically significant difference was found between the 2 MARS quality scores, indicating that, on average, apps were ranked significantly lower on subjective quality compared with overall quality measures.; CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation revealed that of the available apps targeting NICU parents, less than half should be considered as acceptable educational material. Over two-thirds of the apps were found to have issues regarding credibility and just over a quarter were considered good quality.

AB Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) ranks fourth among cancer-related deaths in China due to the lack of actionable molecules. We performed whole-exome and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing on multi-regional tumors, normal tissues and blood samples from 39 ESCC patients. The data revealed 12.8% of ERBB4 mutations at patient level and functional study supported its oncogenic role. 18% ofpatients with early BRCA1/2 variants were associated with high-level contribution of signature 3, which was validated in an independent large cohort (n=508). Furthermore, knockdown of BRCA1/2 dramatically increased sensitivity to cisplatin in ESCC cells. 5% ofpatients harbored focal high-level amplification of CD274 that led to massive expression of PD-L1, and might be more sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, we found atight correlation between genomic and TCR repertoire intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). Collectively, we reveal high-level ITH in ESCC, identify several potential actionable targets and may provide novel insight into ESCC treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: High levels of stigma towards people who inject drugs (PWID) and people living with HIV (PLWH) exist in Kazakhstan, yet little is known about the role of stigma in harm reduction service settings. In this paper, we use a mixed method design to explore and describe the actionable drivers and facilitators of stigma among harm reduction service providers. Additionally, we describe the manifestations of stigma among PWID who are living with HIV (PWID/LWH), and the impact that stigma has on harm reduction and healthcare service utilization.; METHODS: Eight focus groups with 57 PWID/LWH were convened between March 2016 and July 2016 to describe manifestations of stigma from the perspective of syringe exchange program (SEP) clients. Additionally, we surveyed 80 nurses, social workers, outreach workers, and providers of HIV care at SEPs between January 2017 and July 2017 to assess stigmatizing attitudes among staff within the SEP environment. Joint displays were used to integrate quantitative and qualitative data.; RESULTS: The actionable drivers of stigma identified in this study include negative opinions and moral judgements towards PWID/LWH. Facilitators identified included stigmatization as a social norm within the service provision environment, a lack of awareness of anti-discrimination policies, and lack of enforcement of anti-discrimination policies. Qualitative findings highlight manifestations of stigma in which PWID/LWH experienced denial of services, perceived negative attitudes, and avoidance from service provision staff. PWID/LWH also described segregation in healthcare settings, the use of unnecessary precautions by providers, and unauthorized disclosure of HIV status.; CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the urgent need to address stigma in the harm reduction and HIV service settings in Kazakhstan. These findings have implications for informing an actionable model for stigma reduction for providers who deliver services to PWID/LWH in Kazakhstan. Drivers, facilitators, and manifestations of stigma are multifaceted and addressing them will require a multilevel approach. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB INTRODUCTION: Diversity has become a key-strategic element of success in various political and economic fields. The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) decided to make diversity a key strategic priority for the future and appointed a Task-Force on this topic.; METHODS: In a consensus process, three Working-Groups, nominated by Task-Force members, developed statements on strategic future topics. In addition, diversity-related data available from the membership database have been analyzed and reported in aggregated form.; RESULTS: The Task-Force decided to nominate working groups on (1) "sex, gender identity and sexual orientation", (2) "ethnicity, culture and socio-economic status", and (3) "multiprofessionalism". These are the first prioritized topics for the near future. The first diversity-report shows targetable items in all three domains.; CONCLUSION: The diversity Task-Force defined actionable items for a one- and three-year plan that are especially aiming at the identification of potential gaps and an implementation of concrete projects for members of the ESICM.

AB Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis and changed the way we diagnose and treat disease leading to more precise, predictable and powerful health care that is customized for the individual patient. Genetic, genomics, and epigenetic alterations appear to be contributing to different diseases. Deep clinical phenotyping, combined with advanced molecular phenotypic profiling, enables the construction of causal network models in which a genomic region is proposed to influence the levels of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. Phenotypic analysis bears great importance to elucidat the pathophysiology of networks at the molecular and cellular level. Digital biomarkers (BMs) can have several applications beyond clinical trials in diagnostics-to identify patients affected by a disease or to guide treatment. Digital BMs present a big opportunity to measure clinical endpoints in a remote, objective and unbiased manner. However, the use of "omics" technologies and large sample sizes have generated massive amounts of data sets, and their analyses have become a major bottleneck requiring sophisticated computational and statistical methods. With the wealth of information for different diseases and its link to intrinsic biology, the challenge is now to turn the multi-parametric taxonomic classification of a disease into better clinical decision-making by more precisely defining a disease. As a result, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to this vast data set. The advancements in digital health opportunities have also arisen numerous questions and concerns on the future of healthcare practices in particular with what regards the reliability of AI diagnostic tools, the impact on clinical practice and vulnerability of algorithms. AI, machine learning algorithms, computational biology, and digital BMs will offer an opportunity to translate new data into actionable information thus, allowing earlier diagnosis and precise treatment options. A better understanding and cohesiveness of the different components of the knowledge network is a must to fully exploit the potential of it.

AB OBJECTIVE: Limited examples exist globally of coordinated, organisation-wide health literacy approaches to systematically improve the understandability and actionability of patient health information. Even fewer have been formally evaluated. The aim of this study was to use the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) to evaluate the effectiveness of an organisation-wide, evidence-based approach to improve the understandability and actionability of patient information materials in regional health service in New South Wales, Australia.; METHODS: Two independent raters (blinded to the document version) evaluated pre- and post-implementation versions of 50 randomly-selected patient information materials using the PEMAT, with differences in understandability and actionability analysed using paired samples tests.; RESULTS: Mean (±SD) overall scores for understandability increased significantly by 5% (95% CI 2-8; p=0.002) up to 77%±10%, and mean actionability (±SD) increased significantly by 4% (95% CI 0-8; p=0.046) up to 56%±22%.; CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that organisation-wide approaches with standardised processes for staff to prepare, review and store written patient information and education materials can be successfully implemented to address the impacts and risks of low health literacy.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The success of this approach provides a framework for other health organisations to work in partnership with patients to make health information more understandable and actionable.

AB Regulatory affairs professionals play pivotal roles in ensuring healthcare products adhere to regulations and in gaining regulatory approval for product manufacture and sales. To do this, they must understand the science and technology connected with a product, the company's business goals, and, most importantly, the nuances of national and international regulations and guidances connected to the product. But although they perform complicated work connected to the entire product development lifecycle, surveys have indicated only 14% of regulatory professionals come to the field with a degree related to the work and for more than half, regulatory work is a "second career." The net result is a heterogeneous professional population that must learn complex, detailed work on the fly in as short a time as possible. Without a structure to guide development, these expectations are a challenge for someone new to the field, that person's supervisor, and for training developers. Various non-profit groups have created competency models to provide this structure, but because competencies only identify traits demonstrated by high-performing professionals, not the specific tasks associated with individual roles, these models have had limited impact on the profession. Identifying and structuring actionable tasks based on a competency model would increase the model's utility, dissemination, and usage. Entrustable professional activities might provide the methodology for doing so.

AB Agroforestry is a common traditional practice in China-especially in the southern Xinjiang of Northwest China. However, the productivity of many agroforestry systems has been lower than expected in recent years, highlighting the need for an actionably deep mechanistic understanding of the competition between crops and trees. Here, three different fruit tree/wheat (jujube/wheat, apricot /wheat, and walnut /wheat) intercropping agroforestry systems were chosen to investigate influence of different fruit tree shade intensity on the growth, yield and quality of intercropping wheat. Compared to the monoculture wheat system, the mean daily shade intensity of the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems were, respectively, 23.2%, 57.5%, and 80.7% shade. The photosynthetic rate of wheat in the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems decreased by, respectively, 11.3%, 31.9%, and 36.2% compared to monoculture wheat, and the mean number of fertile florets per spike decreased by 26.4%, 37.4%, and 49.5%. Moreover, the apricot- and walnut-based intercropping systems deleteriously affected grain yield (constituent components spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight) and decreased the total N, P, and K content of intercropping wheat. Tree shading intensity strongly enhanced the grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time of wheat, but significantly decreased the softening degree. Strong negative linear correlations were observed between tree shade intensity and the number of fertile florets, grain yield related traits (including spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight), nutrient content (N, P and K), and softening degree of wheat. In contrast, Daily shade intensity was positively linearly correlated with grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time. We conclude that jujube-based intercropping systems can be practical in the region, as they do not decrease the yield and quality of intercropping wheat.

AB Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been proven to be linked to increased risks of a multitude of negative health outcomes and conditions when children reach adulthood and beyond. To better understand the relationship between ACEs and the associated health outcomes and eventually to pan and implement preventive interventions, access to an integrated coherent actionable data set is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a formal reusable ontological framework to capture the knowledge in the domain of Adverse Childhood Experiences to improve ACEs surveillance and response.

AB The aim of this paper is to present examples of big data techniques that can be applied on Holistic Health Records (HHR) in the context of the CrowdHEALTH project. Real-time big data analytics can be performed on the stored data (i.e. HHRs) enabling correlations and extraction of situational factors between laboratory exams, physical activities, biosignals, medical data patterns, and clinical assessment. Based on the outcomes of different analytics (e.g. risk analysis, pathways mining, forecasting and causal analysis) on the aforementioned HHRs datasets, actionable information can be obtained for the development of efficient health plans and public health policies.

AB The endometrium is a dynamic, repetitively cycling tissue that mediates the implantation of the blastocyst. Evaluation of this complex tissue necessitates sophisticated methods that can assess its functional potential. Beginning in the 1950s with simple histological endometrial "dating," these methods have crossed into the molecular era with the use of arrays aimed at dating, functional tests that assess for proliferation and differentiation, and tests that screen for inflammatory markers. In addition to these specialized tests, histologic evaluation for pathologic conditions-such as growth disorders (i.e. polyps and hyperplasia), inflammatory lesions, and retained products of conception-are critical for a complete assessment of the patient with recurrent implantation failure. Whatever the means of testing, the goal is to reveal actionable findings that can assist in offering the best options to patients who have failed multiple transfers with high quality embryos.

AB Background: Genetic variability in some of the genes that affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination ("pharmacogenes") can significantly influence an individual's response to the drug and consequently the effectiveness of treatment and possible adverse drug events. The rapid development of sequencing methods in recent years and consequently the increased integration of next-generation sequencing technologies into the clinical settings has enabled extensive genotyping of pharmacogenes for personalized treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency and variety of potentially actionable pharmacogenetic findings in the Slovenian population. Methods: De-identified data from diagnostic exome sequencing in 1904 cases submitted to our institution were analyzed for variants within 293 genes associated with drug response. Filtered variants were classified according to population frequency, variant type, the functional impact of the variant, pathogenicity predictions and characterization in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and ClinVar. Results: We observed a total of 24 known actionable pharmacogenetic variants (PharmGKB 1A or 1B level of evidence), comprising approximately 26 drugs, of which, 12 were rare, with the population frequency below 1%. Furthermore, we identified an additional 61 variants with PharmGKB 2A or 2B clinical annotations. We detected 308 novel/rare potentially actionable variants: 177 protein-truncating variants and 131 missense variants predicted to be pathogenic based on several pathogenicity predictions. Conclusion: In the present study, we estimated the burden of pharmacogenetic variants in nationally based exome sequencing data and investigated the potential clinical usefulness of detected findings for personalized treatment. We provide the first comprehensive overview of known pharmacogenetic variants in the Slovenian population, as well as reveal a great proportion of novel/rare variants with a potential to influence drug response.

AB Prevention of incident and progressive cancer diminishes health care costs and reduces treatment-associated morbidities. This Seminar series of Urologic Oncology explores one potential method of cancer prevention and treatment: lifestyle modification. In general, lifestyle recommendations for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer mirror those for cardiovascular and global health: increased vegetable and fruit intakes; decreased red meat, saturated fat, and refined carbohydrate intakes; increased physical activity; smoking avoidance or cessation; and moderation of alcohol intake. The challenge lies in the design of actionable behavior-based therapies, which should minimize economic burdens for patients, promote standardized treatments, deliver efficient care to relatively large patient populations, and engage stakeholders.

AB Clinical-grade next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tissue- and blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) allows assessment of multiple genomic alterations in patients with cancer. We analyzed ctDNA (54-70 genes) in 62 patients with advanced breast cancer (median = five prior therapies); 38 also had tissue NGS (236-315 genes). Overall, 42 of 62 patients (68%) had detectable (characterized) ctDNA alterations (variants of unknown significance excluded), and 37 of 38 (97%) had tissue alterations. The median (range) number of characterized alterations in ctDNA was 1 (0-7), and in tissue, 4 (0-17). The most common alterations in ctDNA were in TP53 (37% of patients) and PIK3CA (23%), and for tissue, TP53 (37%) and PIK3CA (24%); EGFR amplification was seen in ctDNA (11%), but not in tissue. Concordance between ctDNA and tissue appeared higher if <6 months separated the sample acquisition, although small sample size precluded statistical validation. Overall, 32 of 67 tissue alterations (48%) were also detected in ctDNA; 35 of 72 ctDNA alterations (48%) were also in tissue. Excluding estrogen receptor and ERBB2, 41 of 62 patients (66%) had potentially actionable alterations in ctDNA, and 36 of 38 (95%), in tissue (with potential actionability based on either preclinical or clinical evidence). If ≥1 genomic alteration had ctDNA ≥5%, survival was shorter than if ctDNA was <5% (median, 6.7 vs. 17.9 months; P = 0.01). In conclusion, tissue and ctDNA NGS reveal potentially actionable alterations in most patients. The genomic results of ctDNA and tissue NGS overlap, but there are differences, perhaps reflecting temporal spacing and tumor heterogeneity. ctDNA quantification also provides prognostic information. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children <15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.; PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.; KEY ACTION STATEMENTS: The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥1 of the following: temperature >38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.; DIFFERENCES FROM PRIOR GUIDELINE: Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

AB Data management plans (DMPs) are documents accompanying research proposals and project outputs. DMPs are created as free-form text and describe the data and tools employed in scientific investigations. They are often seen as an administrative exercise and not as an integral part of research practice. There is now widespread recognition that the DMP can have more thematic, machine-actionable richness with added value for all stakeholders: researchers, funders, repository managers, research administrators, data librarians, and others. The research community is moving toward a shared goal of making DMPs machine-actionable to improve the experience for all involved by exchanging information across research tools and systems and embedding DMPs in existing workflows. This will enable parts of the DMP to be automatically generated and shared, thus reducing administrative burdens and improving the quality of information within a DMP. This paper presents 10 principles to put machine-actionable DMPs (maDMPs) into practice and realize their benefits. The principles contain specific actions that various stakeholders are already undertaking or should undertake in order to work together across research communities to achieve the larger aims of the principles themselves. We describe existing initiatives to highlight how much progress has already been made toward achieving the goals of maDMPs as well as a call to action for those who wish to get involved.

AB At the root of the so-called precision medicine or precision oncology, which is our focus here, is the hypothesis that cancer treatment would be considerably better if therapies were guided by a tumor's genomic alterations. This hypothesis has sparked major initiatives focusing on whole-genome and/or exome sequencing, creation of large databases, and developing tools for their statistical analyses-all aspiring to identify actionable alterations, and thus molecular targets, in a patient. At the center of the massive amount of collected sequence data is their interpretations that largely rest on statistical analysis and phenotypic observations. Statistics is vital, because it guides identification of cancer-driving alterations. However, statistics of mutations do not identify a change in protein conformation; therefore, it may not define sufficiently accurate actionable mutations, neglecting those that are rare. Among the many thematic overviews of precision oncology, this review innovates by further comprehensively including precision pharmacology, and within this framework, articulating its protein structural landscape and consequences to cellular signaling pathways. It provides the underlying physicochemical basis, thereby also opening the door to a broader community.

AB BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop a set of quality indicators for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in intensive care units (ICUs) across Europe and to explore barriers and facilitators for implementation of these quality indicators.; METHODS: A preliminary list of 66 quality indicators was developed, based on current guidelines, existing practice variation, and clinical expertise in TBI management at the ICU. Eight TBI experts of the Advisory Committee preselected the quality indicators during a first Delphi round. A larger Europe-wide expert panel was recruited for the next two Delphi rounds. Quality indicator definitions were evaluated on four criteria: validity (better performance on the indicator reflects better processes of care and leads to better patient outcome), feasibility (data are available or easy to obtain), discriminability (variability in clinical practice), and actionability (professionals can act based on the indicator). Experts scored indicators on a 5-point Likert scale delivered by an electronic survey tool.; RESULTS: The expert panel consisted of 50 experts from 18 countries across Europe, mostly intensivists (N=24, 48%) and neurosurgeons (N=7, 14%). Experts agreed on a final set of 42 indicators to assess quality of ICU care: 17 structure indicators, 16 process indicators, and 9 outcome indicators. Experts are motivated to implement this finally proposed set (N=49, 98%) and indicated routine measurement in registries (N=41, 82%), benchmarking (N=42, 84%), and quality improvement programs (N=41, 82%) as future steps. Administrative burden was indicated as the most important barrier for implementation of the indicator set (N=48, 98%).; CONCLUSIONS: This Delphi consensus study gives insight in which quality indicators have the potential to improve quality of TBI care at European ICUs. The proposed quality indicator set is recommended to be used across Europe for registry purposes to gain insight in current ICU practices and outcomes of patients with TBI. This indicator set may become an important tool to support benchmarking and quality improvement programs for patients with TBI in the future.

AB Background: Determining mitotic index by counting mitotic figures (MFs) microscopically from tumor areas with most abundant MF (hotspots [HS]) produces a prognostically useful tumor grading biomarker. However, interobserver concordance identifying MF and HS can be poorly reproducible. Immunolabeling MF, coupled with computer-automated counting by image analysis, can improve reproducibility. A computational system for obtaining MF values across digitized whole-slide images (WSIs) was sought that would minimize impact of artifacts, generate values clinically relatable to counting ten high-power microscopic fields of view typical in conventional microscopy, and that would reproducibly map HS topography.; Materials and Methods: Relatively low-resolution WSI scans (0.50 mum/pixel) were imported in grid-tile format for feature-based MF segmentation, from naturally occurring canine melanomas providing a wide range of proliferative activity. MF feature extraction conformed to anti-phospho-histone H3-immunolabeled mitotic (M) phase cells. Computer vision image processing was established to subtract key artifacts, obtain MF counts, and employ rotationally invariant feature extraction to map MF topography.; Results: The automated topometric HS (TMHS) algorithm identified mitotic HS and mapped select tissue tiles with greatest MF counts back onto WSI thumbnail images to plot HS topographically. Influence of dye, pigment, and extraneous structure artifacts was minimized. TMHS diagnostic decision support included image overlay graphics of HS topography, as well as a spreadsheet and plot of tile-based MF count values. TMHS performance was validated examining both mitotic HS counting and mapping functions. Significantly correlated TMHS MF mapping and metrics were demonstrated using repeat analysis with WSI in different orientation (R 2 = 0.9916) and by agreement with a pathologist (R 2 = 0.8605) as well as through assessment of counting function using an independently tuned object counting algorithm (OCA) (R 2 = 0.9482). Limits of agreement analysis support method interchangeability. MF counts obtained led to accurate patient survival prediction in all (n = 30) except one case. By contrast, more variable performance was documented when several pathologists examined similar cases using microscopy (pair-wise correlations, rho range = 0.7597-0.9286).; Conclusions: Automated TMHS MF segmentation and feature engineering performance were interchangeable with both observer and OCA in digital mode. Moreover, enhanced HS location accuracy and superior method reproducibility were achieved using the automated TMHS algorithm compared to the current practice employing clinical microscopy.

AB Approximately 50% of prostate cancers harbor the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion, resulting in elevated expression of the ERG transcription factor. Despite the identification of this subclass of prostate cancers, no personalized therapeutic strategies have achieved clinical implementation. Kinases are attractive therapeutic targets as signaling networks are commonly perturbed in cancers. The impact of elevated ERG expression on kinase signaling networks in prostate cancer has not been investigated. Resolution of this issue may identify novel therapeutic approaches for ERG-positive prostate cancers. In this study, we used quantitative mass spectrometry-based kinomic profiling to identify ERG-mediated changes to cellular signaling networks. We identified 76 kinases that were differentially expressed and/or phosphorylated in DU145 cells engineered to express ERG. In particular, the Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) was markedly upregulated and phosphorylated on multiple sites upon ERG overexpression. Importantly, TNIK has not previously been implicated in prostate cancer. To validate the clinical relevance of these findings, we characterized expression of TNIK and TNIK phosphorylated at serine 764 (pS764) in a localized prostate cancer patient cohort and showed that nuclear enrichment of TNIK (pS764) was significantly positively correlated with ERG expression. Moreover, TNIK protein levels were dependent upon ERG expression in VCaP cells and primary cells established from a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft. Furthermore, reduction of TNIK expression and activity by silencing TNIK expression or using the TNIK inhibitor NCB-0846 reduced cell viability, colony formation and anchorage independent growth. Therefore, TNIK represents a novel and actionable therapeutic target for ERG-positive prostate cancers that could be exploited to develop new treatments for these patients.

AB Heat acclimation or acclimatization (HA) occurs with repeated exposure to heat inducing adaptations that enhance thermoregulatory mechanisms and heat tolerance leading to improved exercise performance in warm-to-hot conditions. HA is an essential heat safety and performance enhancement strategy in preparation for competitions in warm-to-hot conditions for both individual and team sports. Yet, some data indicate HA is an underutilized pre-competition intervention in athletes despite the well-known benefits; possibly due to a lack of practical information provided to athletes and coaches. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide actionable evidence-based implementation strategies and protocols to induce and sustain HA. We propose the following suggestions to circumvent potential implementation barriers: 1) incorporate multiple induction methods during the initial acclimation period, 2) complete HA 1-3weeks before competition in the heat to avoid training and logistical conflicts during the taper period, and 3) minimize adaptation decay through intermittent exercise-heat exposure or re-acclimating immediately prior to competition with 2-4 consecutive days of exercise-heat training. Use of these strategies may be desirable or necessary to optimize HA induction and retention around existing training or logistical requirements.

AB Rationale Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are widely associated with positive outcomes, yet carry key indicators of a systemic failed immune response against unresolved cancer. Cancer immunotherapies can reverse their tolerance phenotypes, while preserving tumor-reactivity and neoantigen-specificity shared with circulating immune cells. Objectives We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analyses to identify gene signatures common to circulating and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Modulated genes also associated with disease outcome were validated in other cancer types. Findings Using bioinformatics, we identified practical diagnostic markers and actionable targets of the failed immune response. On circulating lymphocytes, three genes, LEF1, FASLG, and MMP9, could efficiently stratify patients from healthy control donors. From their associations with resistance to cancer immunotherapies and microbial infections, we uncovered not only pan-cancer, but pan-pathology failed immune response profiles. A prominent lymphocytic matrix metallopeptidase cell migration pathway, is central to a panoply of diseases and tumor immunogenicity, correlates with multi-cancer recurrence, and identifies a feasible, non-invasive approach to pan-pathology diagnoses. Conclusions The non-invasive differently expressed genes we have identified warrant future investigation towards the development of their potential in precision diagnostics and precision pan-disease immunotherapeutics.

AB PURPOSE: Genetic sequencing for children with congenital diarrhea and enteropathy (CODE) has important implications for the diagnosis, prognosis, and implementation of precision medicine.; METHODS: We performed exome sequencing or targeted panel sequencing on 137 children with CODE. Endoscopic, imaging, histological, and immunological assessments were also applied. Patients were divided into three subgroups: watery, fatty, and bloody diarrhea.; RESULTS: The median age of onset among patients was 28.0 (interquartile range: 7.5-120.0) days. Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 88/137 (64.2%) of patients. The diagnostic rate was significantly higher in the neonatal group than in the group of patients who had disease onset within 2 years of age (p=0.033). The diagnostic rates were 71.9% (46/64) for targeted gene panel sequencing and 57.5% (42/73) for exome sequencing (p=0.081). We identified pathogenic variants in 17 genes. Based on genetic sequencing, 59.9% of patients were diagnosed with medically actionable disorders. Precision medicine was carried out by means of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with IL10RA, CYBB, or FOXP3 deficiency; pancreatic enzyme replacement for patients with SBDS or UBR1 deficiency; and a special diet for patients with SLC5A1 deficiency. The overall mortality rate was 14.6%.; CONCLUSION: Single-gene disorders are common among CODE patients. Genetic diagnosis can improve therapy by enabling precision medicine.

AB Aim: To evaluate whether clinical genomic sequencing may benefit Chinese patients with stage IV cancer. Patients & methods: Chinese patients with cancer and their oncologists were provided with genomic sequencing results and corresponding clinical treatment recommendations based on evidence-based medicine, defined as CWES (clinical whole-exome sequencing)analysis. Chinese patients with stage IV cancer who failed the previous treatment upon receiving the CWES reports were included for analyzing the impact of CWES on clinical outcomes in 1-year follow-ups. Results:A total of88.6% of 953 Chinese patients with cancer had clinically actionable somatic genomic alterations. Eleven patients followed the CWES reports, and 11 patients did not follow the CWES suggestions. The median progression-free survivalof two groups were 12 and 4 months, and 45and 91% of patients failed this round of therapy, respectively. Conclusion: The current study suggested that CWES has the potential to increase clinical benefits for Chinese patients with stage IV cancer.

AB Extraordinary advances in high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinformatics are the main thrust that transforms the current state of healthcare into the era of precision medicine where clinical practice takes individual variability into account. Here, we summarize the current status of the infrastructure we have and the adoption of precision medicine in Thailand in four spheres: rare diseases, oncology, pharmacogenomics, and noncommunicable diseases. Moreover, we provide our perspectives to the future of precision medicine in Thailand, especially the manpower and ethical, legal, and social issues. We believe that with decreasing costs of NGS, increasing ability to interpret the genomic data, a greater number of actionable and available treatments, implementation of precision medicine at the public health level is not a matter of if but when. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Transaldolase deficiency (MIM#: 606003) is a rare autosomal recessive defect in the pentose phosphate pathway. Affected individuals are at risk for progressive liver failure and hepatocarcinoma. In the transaldolase-deficient mouse model (Taldo1 -/-), these hepatic complications are accentuated by oxidative stress related to acetaminophen administration. We report a 13-month-old transaldolase-deficient male who developed mild liver failure after receiving standard doses of acetaminophen during a febrile respiratory syncytial virus infection. He was admitted for respiratory distress with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, but developed an enlarged nodular liver with accompanying splenomegaly and rising alpha-fetoprotein which peaked 2 weeks after acetaminophen exposure. Whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants c.512_514delCCT (p.Ser171del) and c.931G>T (p.Gly311Trp) in TALDO1 (HGNC:11559), which encodes transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2), a key enzyme in ribose metabolism. Urine polyols and plasma metabolomics confirmed the diagnosis of transaldolase deficiency. Studies on the Taldo1 -/- mouse model demonstrate acetaminophen-induced liver failure can be prevented by administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Moreover, a published report showed treatment of a transaldolase-deficient patient with N-acetylcysteine was associated with a decrease in alpha-fetoprotein levels. After discontinuation of acetaminophen and prior to initiation of N-acetylcysteine treatment, our patient demonstrated resolving alpha-fetoprotein levels suggesting acetaminophen incited the liver failure. Conclusion: Our observations support the conclusion from mouse model studies that transaldolase-deficient patients are uniquely sensitive to acetaminophen and should avoid this antipyretic. Recognition of this individualized toxicity and avoidance of acetaminophen are essential for management of these patients.

AB Policy Points Narratives about patients' experiences with outpatient care are essential for quality improvement because they convey ample actionable information that both elaborates on existing domains within patient experience surveys and describes multiple additional domains that are important to patients. The content of narrative feedback from patients can potentially be translated to improved quality in multiple ways: clinicians can learn from their own patients, groups of clinicians can learn from the experience of their peers' patients, and health system administrators can identify and respond to patterns in patients' accounts that reflect systemic challenges to quality. Consistent investment by payers and providers is required to ensure that patient narratives are rigorously collected, analyzed fully, and effectively used for quality improvement.; CONTEXT: For the past 25 years, health care providers and health system administrators have sought to improve care by surveying patients about their experiences. More recently, policymakers have acted to promote this learning by deploying financial incentives tied to survey scores. This article explores the potential of systematically elicited narratives about experiences with outpatient care to enrich quality improvement.; METHODS: Narratives were collected from 348 patients recruited from a nationally representative Internet panel. Drawing from the literature on health services innovation, we developed a two-part coding schema that categorized narrative content in terms of (a) the aspects of care being described, and (b) the actionability of this information for clinicians, quality improvement staff, and health system administrators. Narratives were coded using this schema, with high levels of reliability among the coders.; FINDINGS: The scope of outpatient narratives divides evenly among aspects of care currently measured by patient experience surveys (35% of content), aspects related to measured domains but not captured by existing survey questions (31%), and aspects of care that are omitted from surveys entirely (34%). Overall, the narrative data focused heavily on relational aspects of care (43%), elaborating on this aspect of experience well beyond what is captured with communication-related questions on existing surveys. Three-quarters of elicited narratives had some actionable content, and almost a third contained three or more separate actionable elements.; CONCLUSIONS: In a health policy environment that incentivizes attention to patient experience, rigorously elicited narratives hold substantial promise for improving quality in general and patients' experiences with care in particular. They do so in two ways: by making concrete what went wrong or right in domains covered by existing surveys, and by expanding our view of what aspects of care matter to patients as articulated in their own words and thus how care can be made more patient-centered. Most narratives convey experiences that are potentially actionable by those committed to improving health care quality in outpatient settings. © 2019 Milbank Memorial Fund.

AB OBJECTIVES: Recent guideline changes for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention medication have resulted in calls to implement shared decision-making rather than arbitrary treatment thresholds. Less attention has been paid to existing tools that could facilitate this. Decision aids are well-established tools that enable shared decision-making and have been shown to improve CVD prevention adherence. However, it is unknown how many CVD decision aids are publicly available for patients online, what their quality is like and whether they are suitable for patients with lower health literacy, for whom the burden of CVD is greatest. This study aimed to identify and evaluate all English language, publicly available online CVD prevention decision aids.; DESIGN: Systematic review of public websites in August to November 2016 using an environmental scan methodology, with updated evaluation in April 2018. The decision aids were evaluated based on: (1) suitability for low health literacy populations (understandability, actionability and readability); and (2) International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS).; PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Understandability and actionability using the validated Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printed Materials (PEMAT-P scale), readability using Gunning-Fog and Flesch-Kincaid indices and quality using IPDAS V.3 and V.4.; RESULTS: A total of 25 unique decision aids were identified. On the PEMAT-P scale, the decision aids scored well on understandability (mean 87%) but not on actionability (mean 61%). Readability was also higher than recommended levels (mean Gunning-Fog index=10.1; suitable for grade 10 students). Four decision aids met criteria to be considered a decision aid (ie, met IPDAS qualifying criteria) and one sufficiently minimised major bias (ie, met IPDAS certification criteria).; CONCLUSIONS: Publicly available CVD prevention decision aids are not suitable for low literacy populations and only one met international standards for certification. Given that patients with lower health literacy are at increased risk of CVD, this urgently needs to be addressed. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper reviews performance measure in health, their importance, and methodologic issues, focusing on metrics for health failure patients. Quality measures are instruments to assess structural aspects or processes of care aiming to guarantee that optimal patient outcomes are achieved. As heart failure is a chronic condition in which established therapies reduce mortality and hospital admissions, there are quite a lot of initiatives that aim to monitor for quality of care and to coordinate the disease management.; RECENT FINDINGS: Several performance measures were validated for these patients, from process of care (left ventricular function assessment and use of ACEi/ARBs and beta-blockers) to health outcomes (hospital mortality and readmissions). In the early years, studies demonstrated a relationship between quality measurements and health outcomes. Nonetheless, more recent ones based on large databases of patients' medical records have shown that traditional indicators explain only a small fraction of health and patient reported- and perceived outcomes. Public reporting of quality measures and payment conditioned to the quality of care provided were not able to show benefit in terms of hard outcomes. Data science and big data methods are promising in providing actionable knowledge for quality improvement, with real-time data that could support decision-making. Heart failure is a chronic condition that has proven to be useful for measuring medical and healthcare quality. Evidence-based indicators have already reached high rates of adherence and are currently poorly correlated with outcomes. Using real-life data and based on the patient's perspective can be useful tools to improve these indicators.

AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) comprises more than 80% of all renal cancers and when metastasized leads to a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. The high rate of therapy failure and resistance development calls for reliable methods that provide information on the actionable biological pathways and predict optimal treatment protocols for individual patients. We here applied targeted RNA sequencing (t/RNA-NGS) using single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes on tumor nephrectomy samples of five ccRCC patients, comparing tumor with healthy kidney tissues. Transcriptome profiling focused on expression of genes with involvement in ccRCC biology that can be targeted with clinically available drugs. Results confirm high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in tumor tissue relative to healthy-appearing kidney, in line with the angiogenic nature of ccRCC. PDGFRalpha and KIT, targets of the multi-kinase inhibitor sunitinib which is one of the current choices of first-line drug in metastasized ccRCC patients, were expressed at relatively low levels in tumor tissues, whereas significantly increased in normal kidney. Of all measured druggable tyrosine kinases, MET, AXL, or EGFR were expressed at higher levels in tumors than in normal kidney tissues, although intertumor differences were observed. Using cancer cell lines we show that t/RNA-NGS gene expression profiles can be used to predict in vitro sensitivity to targeted drugs. In conclusion, t/RNA-NGS analysis may provide insights into the (druggable) molecular make-up of individual renal cancers, and may guide personalized therapy of renal cell cancers.

AB Exploring resistance mechanisms in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) upon disease progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been an area of great interest as it may lead to effective next-line treatment strategies. Here we report a case of emergent MET amplification detected in a tumor sample from a patient with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R mutation after disease progression on erlotinib. The patient subsequently had a sustained partial response to a combination of full-dose osimertinib and crizotinib with excellent tolerance but eventually had central nervous system (CNS) progression. Comprehensive genomic profiling performed on the resected brain sample continued to demonstrate MET amplification as an acquired resistance mechanism. A review of literature shows several groups have utilized similar combination regimens (erlotinib or osimertinib + crizotinib or cabozantinib), albeit with various dosing to target MET alterations in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. As more actionable resistance mechanisms are identified, we envision combination TKI therapy will be readily adopted in clinical practice. Our case report adds to a growing body of evidence that combination osimertinib and crizotinib should be recommended to EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with emergent MET amplification as acquired resistance. More importantly, as crizotinib has limited brain penetration, developing next-generation MET inhibitors with better CNS activity is urgently needed.

AB Background: Over the past two decades, various novel disease-modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis (MS) have been approved. However, there is high variability in the patient response to the available medications, which is hypothesized to be partly attributed to genetics. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of the current literature on the pharmacogenomics of MS therapy. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE database searching for articles investigating a role of genetic variation in response to disease-modifying MS treatments, published in the English language up to October 9th, 2018. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were applied. Studies were included if they investigated response or nonresponse to MS treatment defined as relapse rate, by expanded disability status scale score or based on magnetic resonance imaging. The following data were extracted: first author's last name, year of publication, PMID number, sample size, ethnicity of patients, method, genes, and polymorphisms tested, outcome, significant associations with corresponding P-values and confidence intervals, response criteria, and duration of the follow-up period. Results: Overall, 48 articles published up to October 2018, evaluating response to interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab, met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Among those, we identified 42 (87.5%) candidate gene studies and 6 (12.5%) genome-wide association studies. Existing pharmacogenomic evidence is mainly based on the results of individual studies, or on results of multiple studies, which often lack consistency. In recent years, hypothesis-free approaches identified novel candidate genes that remain to be validated. Various study designs, including the definition of clinical response, duration of the follow-up period, and methodology as well as moderate sample sizes, likely contributed to discordances between studies. However, some of the significant associations were identified in the same genes, or in the genes involved in the same biological pathways. Conclusions: At the moment, there is no available clinically actionable pharmacogenomic biomarker that would enable more personalized treatment of MS. More large-scale studies with uniform design are needed to identify novel and validate existing pharmacogenomics findings. Furthermore, studies investigating associations between rare variants and treatment response in MS patients, using next-generation sequencing technologies are warranted.

AB Background: Recent epidemiological evidence shows that colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to occur in carriers of pathogenic mismatch repair (path_MMR) variants despite frequent colonoscopy surveillance in expert centres. This observation conflicts with the paradigm that removal of all visible polyps should prevent the vast majority of CRC in path_MMR carriers, provided the screening interval is sufficiently short and colonoscopic practice is optimal.; Methods: To inform the debate, we examined, in the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD), whether the time since last colonoscopy was associated with the pathological stage at which CRC was diagnosed during prospective surveillance. Path_MMR carriers were recruited for prospective surveillance by colonoscopy. Only variants scored by the InSiGHT Variant Interpretation Committee as class 4 and 5 (clinically actionable) were included. CRCs detected at the first planned colonoscopy, or within one year of this, were excluded as prevalent cancers.; Results: Stage at diagnosis and interval between last prospective surveillance colonoscopy and diagnosis were available for 209 patients with 218 CRCs, including 162 path_MLH1, 45 path_MSH2, 10 path_MSH6 and 1 path_PMS2 carriers. The numbers of cancers detected within <1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5 and at >3.5years since last colonoscopy were 36, 93, 56 and 33, respectively. Among these, 16.7, 19.4, 9.9 and 15.1% were stage III-IV, respectively (p=0.34). The cancers detected more than 2.5years after the last colonoscopy were not more advanced than those diagnosed earlier (p=0.14).; Conclusions: The CRC stage and interval since last colonoscopy were not correlated, which is in conflict with the accelerated adenoma-carcinoma paradigm. We have previously reported that more frequent colonoscopy is not associated with lower incidence of CRC in path_MMR carriers as was expected. In contrast, point estimates showed a higher incidence with shorter intervals between examinations, a situation that may parallel to over-diagnosis in breast cancer screening. Our findings raise the possibility that some CRCs in path_MMR carriers may spontaneously disappear: the host immune response may not only remove CRC precursor lesions in path_MMR carriers, but may remove infiltrating cancers as well.

AB Catalyzed by the ability to develop precision therapies targeting the unique genetic changes that drive individual tumors, sequencing patients' tumor genomes is an increasingly common practice in oncology. In most cancer types, however, a limited number of common mutations are accompanied by a plethora of low-frequency variants whose functional consequences and clinical actionability are often unknown. We here illustrate that this 'long tail' of infrequent molecular alterations includes oncogenic drivers of biological significance that can be the genetic basis of extraordinary responses to systemic cancer therapies. Furthermore, we review current strategies to identify, prioritize, and experimentally validate novel long-tail driver mutations, efforts that will likely provide new insights into the clinically actionable genome and improve outcomes for patients.

AB Assessment of glycaemic outcomes in the management of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized in the past decade with the increasing availability of accurate, user-friendly continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This advancement has brought a need for new techniques to appropriately analyse and understand the voluminous and complex CGM data for application in research-related goals and clinical guidance for individuals. Traditionally, HbA1c was established using the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and other trials as the ultimate measure of glycaemic control in terms of efficacy and, by default, risk of microvascular complications of diabetes. However, it is acknowledged that HbA1c alone is inadequate at describing an individual's daily glycaemic variation and risks for hypo- and hyperglycaemia, and it does not provide the guidance needed to decrease those risks. CGM data provide means by which to characterize an individual's daily glycaemic excursions on a different time scale measured in minutes rather than months. As a consequence, clinical reports, such as the ambulatory glucose profile, increasingly include summary statistics related to averages (mean glucose, time in range) as well as markers related to glycaemic variability (coefficient of variation, standard deviation). However, there is a need to translate those metrics into specific risks that can be addressed in an actionable plan by individuals with diabetes and providers. This review presents several clinical scenarios of glycaemic outcomes from CGM data that can be analysed to describe glycaemic variability and its attendant risks of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, moving towards relevant interpretation of the complex CGM data streams. © 2019 Diabetes UK.

AB African-American (AA) women are more likely to die from breast cancer (BC), at any age, compared to European-American women. Although breakthroughs in pre-clinical studies have resulted in potentially actionable targets in AA BC, drugs that were rationally designed for these targets have performed poorly in clinical trials. Challenges with interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity, lack of drug sensitivity and specificity, suboptimal biomarker cut-offs, lack of drug response predictive biomarkers, drug side effects, high costs of drug development, and under-representation of AAs in clinical trials complicate the development of targeted therapies for AA BC patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that racial disparities exist in non-genetic risk factors that can alter genetic and epigenetic programs to promote breast tumorigenesis. Herein, we present a "roadmap" that addresses non-genetic risk factors that are suspected to contribute to the racial disparity in BC mortality. Increased targeting of these non-genetic risk factors may proffer a safer and more economical route to alleviating the racially disparate burden in BC.

AB Genetic discoveries about human brain development and neuropsychiatric syndromes have changed the landscape of psychiatric research. The genotyping of hundreds of thousands of individuals has identified many hundreds of genomic regions that are associated with psychiatric diagnoses, and progress is being made in uncovering the specific genes that underlie these statistical associations, although most are still undetermined. While there are great expectations that such genetic discoveries will lead to novel treatments based on fundamental mechanisms of illness, there are important caveats. Individual risk-associated common variants explain only a tiny fraction of individual liability. The degree to which common risk variants represent "core" pathogenic insights is controversial. Individuals with rare and more penetrant risk variants are often intellectually disabled, which raises epistemological questions about classification. In clinical research, the application of polygenic risk scores-the cumulative sum of associated alleles in an individual genome-to prediction models of environmental influences and outcome is gaining enthusiasm because these scores explain more liability, but predictions are small and not yet actionable for individuals. Psychiatry is intertwined with genomic medicine, and our understanding of what we call schizophrenia and the possibilities of improving the lives of affected individuals have never seemed more promising. Yet the research challenges are daunting; psychiatric syndromes ultimately reflect how the brain mishandles environmental information, which at the systems level is far "downstream" of the effect of genes in cells.

AB Schizophrenia is a severe global health problem, with over half of such patients experiencing auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). A better understanding of the neural correlates differentiating patients experiencing AVHs from patients not experiencing AVHs and healthy controls may identify targets that lead to better treatment strategies for AVHs. Employing 2 data-driven, voxel-based measure of functional connectivity, we studied 46 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (28 experiencing AVHs and 18 not experiencing AVHs). Twenty healthy controls matched for age, gender, ethnicity, education level, handedness, and estimated verbal intelligence were included for comparison. The intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD) was used to model each voxel's connectivity to the rest of the brain using a Weibull distribution. To investigate lateralization of connectivity, we used cross-hemisphere ICD, a method that separates the contribution of each hemisphere to interrogate connectivity laterality. Patients with AVHs compared with patients without AVHs exhibited significantly decreased whole-brain connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, less lateralized connectivity in left putamen, and more lateralized connectivity in left interior frontal gyrus. Correlations with Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) and post hoc seed connectivity analyses revealed significantly altered network connectivity. Using the results from all analyses comparing the patient groups and correlations with AHRS, we identified a potential AVH network, consisting of 25 nodes, showing substantial overlap with the default mode network and language processing networks. This network as a whole, instead of individual nodes, may represent actionable targets for interventions. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most targeted therapies against cancer are designed to block growth factor-stimulated oncogenic growth. However, response rates are low, and resistance to therapy is high. One mechanism might relate to the ability of tumor cells to induce growth factor-independent proliferation (GFIP). This project aims to understand how (1) cancer cells preferentially derive a major growth advantage by using critical metabolic products of glucose, such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), to drive proliferation and (2) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, but not esophageal adenocarcinoma cells, can induce GFIP by using glycolysis to activate phosphohistidine (poHis)-mediated signaling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK).; METHODS: The hypothesis to be tested is that ESCC GFIP induced by glucose is facilitated by PEP-mediated histidine phosphorylation (poHis) of FAK, leading to the possibility that ESCC progression can be targeted by blocking poHis signaling. Biochemical, molecular biological, and invivo experiments including bromodeoxyuridine/5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine labeling, radioisotope tracing, CRISPR gene editing, and analysis of signaling gene sets in human cancer tissues and xenograft models were performed to define the mechanisms underlying ESCC GFIP.; RESULTS: Glucose promotes growth factor-independent DNA replication and accumulation of PEP in ESCC cells. PEP is the direct phospho-donor to poHis58-FAK within a known "HG" motif for histidine phosphorylation. Glucose-induced poHis58 promotes growth factor-independent FAK-mediated proliferation. Furthermore, glucose activates phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase/AKT via poHis58-FAK signaling. Non-phosphorylatable His58A-FAK reduces xenograft growth.; CONCLUSIONS: Glucose induces ESCC, but not esophageal adenocarcinoma GFIP via PEP-His58-FAK-AKT signaling. ESCCprogression is controlled by actionable growth factor-independent, glucose-induced pathways that regulate proliferation through novel histidine phosphorylation of FAK.

AB Tumor organoids maintain cell-cell interactions, heterogeneity, microenvironment, and drug response of the sample they originate from. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing tumor organoid models for drug development and personalized medicine applications. Although organoids are in principle amenable to high-throughput screenings, progress has been hampered by technical constraints and extensive manipulations required by current methods. Here we introduce a miniaturized method that uses a simplified geometry by seeding cells around the rim of the wells (mini-rings). This allows high-throughput screenings in a format compatible with automation as shown using four patient-derived tumor organoids established from two ovarian and one peritoneal high-grade serous carcinomas and one carcinosarcoma of the ovary. Using our automated screening platform, we identified personalized responses by measuring viability, number, and size of organoids after exposure to 240 kinase inhibitors. Results are available within a week from surgery, a timeline compatible with therapeutic decision-making.

AB Unsupervised semantic segmentation in the time series domain is a much studied problem due to its potential to detect unexpected regularities and regimes in poorly understood data. However, the current techniques have several shortcomings, which have limited the adoption of time series semantic segmentation beyond academic settings for four primary reasons. First, most methods require setting/learning many parameters and thus may have problems generalizing to novel situations. Second, most methods implicitly assume that all the data is segmentable and have difficulty when that assumption is unwarranted. Thirdly, many algorithms are only defined for the single dimensional case, despite the ubiquity of multi-dimensional data. Finally, most research efforts have been confined to the batch case, but online segmentation is clearly more useful and actionable. To address these issues, we present a multi-dimensional algorithm, which is domain agnostic, has only one, easily-determined parameter, and can handle data streaming at a high rate. In this context, we test the algorithm on the largest and most diverse collection of time series datasets ever considered for this task and demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over current solutions.

She developed hypothyroidism at completion of atezolizumab treatment and responded to levothyroxine. Subsequently she was enrolled to a phase II study and received AZD4547 due to an actionable mutation at FGFR3 found in tumor biopsy. Two months later, she experienced recurrent hypothyroidism symptoms, and was hospitalized twice for small bowel obstruction. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level was significantly increased to 2957 uIU/mL (reference range 0.8-7.7uIU/mL). Her levothyroxine dose was increased accordingly. Her thyroid function returned to normal 1month afterwards, and small bowel obstruction did not recur.; Conclusion: Further reports and studies will be needed to confirm the relationship between AZD4547 and hypothyroidism. Based on this observation and possible mechanisms for thyroid dysfunction discussed in this paper, routine thyroid function monitoring in patients receiving FGFR inhibitor should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: It has been a challenge to select treatment for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) based on genome alterations. We performed targeted genomic profile analyses of a large number of PDACs to assess the full spectrum of actionable genomic alterations.; METHODS: We performed targeted genomic profile analyses of 3594 PDAC samples from an international cohort, including capture-based targeted genomic profiling of as many as 315 cancer-associated genes and intron regions of 28 genes that are rearranged in cancer cells. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were also assessed. TMB was calculated across a 1.14-megabase region; TMB-high was defined as ≥20 mutations/megabase. MSI-high status was assigned based on analysis of 114 intron homopolymer loci.; RESULTS: KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 were the most frequently altered genes in PDAC. We found KRAS mutations in 88% of samples. Among PDACs without mutations in KRAS, we found alterations in genes whose products are in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and are candidate drug targets (actionable targets, n= 132; 4%), as well as gene fusions (n= 51), gene amplifications (n= 35), genes with missense mutations (n= 30), and genes that contain deletions (n= 16). Many of these encode proteins in receptor tyrosine kinase, RAS, or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Aside from TP53, alterations in genes encoding DNA damage repair proteins (BRCA and FANC) were detected in 14% of PDACs. Among PDACs evaluated for MSI (n= 2563) and TMB (n= 1021), MSI-high and/or TMB-high phenotypes were detected in 0.5% of samples. Alterations in FGF23, CCND2, PIK3CA, and FGF6 were more commonly detected in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-associated PDACs.; CONCLUSIONS: In targeted genomic profile analyses of 3594 PDACs, we found 17% to contain genomic alterations that might make the tumor cells susceptible to currently used anticancer agents. We identified mutations in genes that could contribute to progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms into malignancies. These alterations might be used as biomarkers for early detection.

AB BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Drug Abuse has identified a persistent research-to-practice gap in the implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment programs for substance use disorder. To identify mechanisms to close this gap, we sought to obtain and characterize the range of policy makers' perspectives on the use of research in substance use disorder treatment and coverage decisions.; METHODS: We conducted open-ended, semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of eighteen policy makers involved in the delivery of health services. The aim was to identify barriers and facilitators, attitudes, beliefs, and experiences surrounding the use of research related to the treatment and economics of substance use disorder.; RESULTS: The analysis generated four themes: 1) policy maker engagement with evidence and researchers; 2) strategic use and usefulness of research; 3) scientific rigor versus relevance; and 4) communication of evidence. Within each theme, the participants identified barriers, facilitators, current practice, and gave their perspectives on "ideal conditions" for research design, conduct and communication.; CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for investigators are the following actionable steps: 1) partner with policy makers early in the research process, 2) formulate and use research designs to meet the strategic goals of end-users; 3) systematically test alternative phrasing of scientific terminology - particularly in the realm of cost effectiveness research - that allow end users to better understand and repurpose the data; 4) incorporate qualitative research methods to uncover the narratives that explain the context and relevance of evidence; 5) incorporate study designs that prioritize timeliness of results; and 6) promote and reward researcher involvement in policy discussions.

AB BRAF and CRAF are critical components of the MAPK signaling pathway which is activated in many cancer types. In approximately 1% of melanomas, BRAF or CRAF are activated through structural arrangements. We describe here a metastatic melanoma with a GOLGA4-RAF1 fusion and pathogenic variants in CTNNB1 and CDKN2A. Anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1 combination immunotherapy failed to control tumor progression. In the absence of other actionable variants the patient was administered MEK inhibitor therapy on the basis of its potential action against RAF1 fusions. This resulted in a profound and clinically significant response. We demonstrated that GOLGA4-RAF1 expression was associated with ERK activation, elevated expression of the RAS/RAF downstream co-effector ETV5, and a high Ki67 index. These findings provide a rationale for the dramatic response to targeted therapy. This study shows that thorough molecular characterization of treatment-resistant cancers can identify therapeutic targets and personalize management, leading to improved patient outcomes.

AB Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people in China consistently report family pressure as the greatest challenge they face in their daily lives. This problem has been explained primarily by highlighting sociocultural factors. While such explanations are important to understanding family pressure, they do not easily lead to actionable policy interventions to relieve it. This article suggests a new way of looking at family pressure by positing a social policy explanation. In particular, it reveals how both the one-child policy and elder care reforms have strong heteronormative biases that negatively and disproportionately affect LGB people, and it explores social policy interventions that may help address them. Beyond the China case, the article seeks to open up new avenues for research into how sexuality could be better accounted for in analyses of social policies and considered in broader discussions on defamilization and welfare state reform.

AB Our healthcare system is experiencing a paradigm shift to precision medicine, aiming at an early prediction of individual disease risks and targeted interventions. Whole-genome sequencing is currently gaining momentum, as it has the potential to capture all classes of genetic variation, thus providing a more complete picture of the individual's genetic makeup, which could be utilized in genetic testing; however, this will also lead to difficulties in interpreting the test results, necessitating careful integration of genomic data with other layers of information, both molecular multiomics measurements of epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and even microbiome, as well as comprehensive information on diet, lifestyle and environment. Overall, the translation of patient-specific data into actionable diagnostic tools will be a challenging task, requiring expertise from multiple disciplines, secure data sharing in large reference databases and a strong computational infrastructure.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells lack the expression of ER, PR and HER2. Thus, TNBC patients cannot benefit from hormone receptor-targeted therapy as non-TNBC patients, but can only receive chemotherapy as the systemic treatment and have a worse overall outcome. More effective therapeutic targets and combination therapy strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment effectiveness. Methods: We analyzed the expression levels of EZH2 and TET1 in TCGA and our own breast cancer patient cohort, and tested their correlation with patient survival. We used TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines and mouse xenograft tumor model to unveil novel EZH2 targets and investigated the effect of EZH2 inhibition or TET1 overexpression in cell proliferation and viability of TNBC cells. Results: In TNBC cells, EZH2 decreases TET1 expression by H3K27me3 epigenetic regulation and subsequently suppresses anti-tumor p53 signaling pathway. Patients with high EZH2 and low TET1 presented the poorest survival outcome. Experimentally, targeting EZH2 in TNBC cells with specific inhibitor GSK343 or shRNA genetic approach could induce cell cycle arrest and senescence by elevating TET1 expression and p53 pathway activation. Using mouse xenograft model, we have tested a novel therapy strategy to combine GSK343 and chemotherapy drug Adriamycin and could show drastic and robust inhibition of TNBC tumor growth by synergistic induction of senescence and apoptosis. Conclusions: We postulate that the well-controlled dynamic pathway EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 is a novel epigenetic co-regulator module and provide evidence regarding how to exploit it as a novel therapeutic target via its pivotal role in senescence and apoptosis control. Of clinical and therapeutic significance, the present study opens a new avenue for TNBC treatment by targeting the EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 pathway that can modulate the epigenetic landscape.

AB Genomically instable cancers are characterized by progressive loss and gain of chromosomal fragments, and the acquisition of complex genomic rearrangements. Such cancers, including triple-negative breast cancers and high-grade serous ovarian cancers, typically show aggressive behavior and lack actionable driver oncogenes. Increasingly, oncogene-induced replication stress or defective replication fork maintenance is considered an important driver of genomic instability. Paradoxically, while replication stress causes chromosomal instability and thereby promotes cancer development, it intrinsically poses a threat to cellular viability. Apparently, tumor cells harboring high levels of replication stress have evolved ways to cope with replication stress. As a consequence, therapeutic targeting of such compensatory mechanisms is likely to preferentially target cancers with high levels of replication stress and may prove useful in potentiating chemotherapeutic approaches that exert their effects by interfering with DNA replication. Here, we discuss how replication stress drives chromosomal instability, and the cell cycle-regulated mechanisms that cancer cells employ to deal with replication stress. Importantly, we discuss how mechanisms involving DNA structure-specific resolvases, cell cycle checkpoint kinases and mitotic processing of replication intermediates offer possibilities in developing treatments for difficult-to-treat genomically instable cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Compared with neuraxial anesthesia, general anesthesia for cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of maternal adverse events. Reducing avoidable general anesthetics for cesarean delivery may improve safety of obstetric anesthesia care. This study examined adverse events, trends, and factors associated with potentially avoidable general anesthetics for cesarean delivery.; METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed cesarean delivery cases without a recorded indication for general anesthesia or contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia in New York State hospitals, 2003 to 2014. Adverse events included anesthesia complications (systemic, neuraxial-related, and drug-related), surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and the composite of death or cardiac arrest. Anesthesia complications were defined as severe if associated with death, organ failure, or prolonged hospital stay.; RESULTS: During the study period, 466,014 cesarean deliveries without a recorded indication for general anesthesia or contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia were analyzed; 26,431 were completed with general anesthesia (5.7%). The proportion of avoidable general anesthetics decreased from 5.6% in 2003 to 2004 to 4.8% in 2013 to 2014 (14% reduction; P < 0.001). Avoidable general anesthetics were associated with significantly increased risk of anesthesia complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9), severe complications (adjusted odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.2), surgical site infection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.1), and venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0), but not of death or cardiac arrest. Labor neuraxial analgesia rate was one of the most actionable hospital-level factors associated with avoidable general anesthetics. Relative to hospitals with a rate greater than or equal to 75%, the adjusted odds ratio of avoidable general anesthetics increased to 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.4), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7), and 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0 to 3.5) as the rate decreased to 50 to 74.9%, 25 to 49.9%, and less than 25%, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Compared with neuraxial anesthesia, avoidable general anesthetics are associated with increased risk of adverse maternal outcomes.

AB Advances in high-throughput technologies and their involvement in the 'omics' of cancer have made possible the identification of hundreds of biomarkers and the development of predictive and prognostic platforms that model the management of cancer from evidence-based medicine to precision medicine. Latin America (LATAM) is a region characterised by fragmented healthcare, high rates of poverty and disparities to access to a basic standard of care not only for cancer but also for other complex diseases. Patients from the public setting cannot afford targeted therapy, the facilities offering genomic platforms are scarce and the use of high-precision radiotherapy is limited to few facilities. Despite the fact that LATAM oncologists are well-trained in the use of genomic platforms and constantly participate in genomic projects, a medical practice based in precision oncology is a great challenge and frequently limited to private practice. In breast cancer, we are waiting for the results of large basket trials to incorporate the detection of actionable mutations to select targeted treatments, in a similar way to the management of lung cancer. On the other hand and paradoxically, in the 'one fit is not for all' era, clinical and genomic studies continue grouping our patients under the single label 'Latin American' or 'Hispanic' despite the different ancestries and genomic backgrounds seen in the region. More regional cancer genomic initiatives and public availability of this data are needed in order to develop more precise oncology in locally advanced breast cancer.

AB The concept of personalized medicine is predominantly been pursued through genomic and transcriptomic technologies, leading to the identification of multiple mutations in a large variety of cancers. However, it has proven challenging to distinguish driver and passenger mutations and to deal with tumor heterogeneity and resistant clonal populations. More generally, these heterogeneous mutation patterns do not in themselves predict the tumor phenotype. Analysis of the expressed proteins in a tumor and their modification states reveals if and how these mutations are translated to the functional level. It is already known that proteomic changes including posttranslational modifications are crucial drivers of oncogenesis, but proteomics technology has only recently become comparable in depth and accuracy to RNAseq. These advances also allow the rapid and highly sensitive analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biobank tissues, on both the proteome and phosphoproteome levels. In this perspective, pioneering mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies are highlighted that pave the way toward clinical implementation. It is argued that proteomics and phosphoproteomics could provide the missing link to make omics analysis actionable in the clinic. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Cancer is a genetic disease. To date, translational cancer genomics has focused largelyon somatic alterations, driven by the desire to identify targets for personalized therapy. However, therapeutically relevant information is also latent within the germline genome. Inaddition to cancer susceptibility, alterations present in the germ line can determine responses to both targeted and more traditional anticancer therapies, as well as their toxicities. Despite the importance of these alterations, many algorithms designed to analyse somatic mutations conversely continue to subtract information on germline genetics during analysis. In the light of low actionable yields from somatic tumour testing, a need exists for diversification of the sources of potential therapeutic biomarkers. In this Review, we summarize the literature on the therapeutic potential of alterations in the germline genome. The therapeutic value of germline information will not only be manifest as improvements in treatment but will also drive greater levels of engagement and cooperation between traditional oncology services and familial risk management clinics.

AB BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is associated with lower health care utilization and savings in specific patient populations; however, few empirical estimates exist at the population level.; OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to apply a data-driven approach to obtain population-level estimates of the impact of medication nonadherence among Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions.; RESEARCH DESIGN: Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims data were used to calculate the prevalence of medication nonadherence among individuals with diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Per person estimates of avoidable health care utilization and spending associated with medication adherence, adjusted for healthy adherer effects, from prior literature were applied to the number of nonadherent Medicare beneficiaries.; SUBJECTS: A 20% random sample of community-dwelling, continuously enrolled Medicare FFS beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with Part D (N=14,657,735) in 2013.; MEASURES: Avoidable health care costs and hospital use from medication nonadherence.; RESULTS: Medication nonadherence for diabetes, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension resulted in billions of Medicare FFS expenditures, millions in hospital days, and thousands of emergency department visits that could have been avoided. If the 25% of beneficiaries with hypertension who were nonadherent became adherent, Medicare could save $13.7 billion annually, with over 100,000 emergency department visits and 7 million inpatient hospital days that could be averted.; CONCLUSION: Medication nonadherence places a large resource burden on the Medicare FFS program. Study results provide actionable information for policymakers considering programs to manage chronic conditions. Caution should be used in summing estimates across disease groups, assuming all nonadherent beneficiaries could become adherent, and applying estimates beyond the Medicare FFS population.

AB The data collected by mobile methane (CH4) sensors can be used to find natural gas (NG) leaks in urban distribution systems. Extracting actionable insights from the large volumes of data collected by these sensors requires several data processing steps. While these survey platforms are commercially available, the associated data processing software largely constitute a black box due to their proprietary nature. In this paper we describe a step-by-step algorithm for developing leak indications using data from mobile CH4 surveys, providing an under-the-hood look at the choices and challenges associated with data analysis. We also describe how our algorithm has evolved over time, and the data-driven insights that have prompted these changes. Applying our algorithm to data collected in 15 cities produced more than 6100 leak indications and estimates of the leaks' size. We use these results to characterize the distribution of leak sizes in local NG distribution systems. Mobile surveys are already an effective and necessary tool for managing NG distribution systems, but improvements in the technology and software will continue to increase its value.

AB BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer among women worldwide. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the study of cancer across research labs around the globe; however, genomic testing in clinical settings remains limited. Advances in sequencing reliability, pipeline analysis, accumulation of relevant data, and the reduction of costs are rapidly increasing the feasibility of NGS-based clinical decision making.; METHODS: We report the development of MammaSeq, a breast cancer-specific NGS panel, targeting 79 genes and 1369 mutations, optimized for use in primary and metastatic breast cancer. To validate the panel, 46 solid tumors and 14 plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 2311* and 1820*, respectively. Variants were called using Ion Torrent Suite 4.0 and annotated with cravat CHASM. CNVKit was used to call copy number variants in the solid tumor cohort. The oncoKB Precision Oncology Database was used to identify clinically actionable variants. Droplet digital PCR was used to validate select ctDNA mutations.; RESULTS: In cohorts of 46 solid tumors and 14 ctDNA samples from patients with advanced breast cancer, we identified 592 and 43 protein-coding mutations. Mutations per sample in the solid tumor cohort ranged from 1 to 128 (median 3), and the ctDNA cohort ranged from 0 to 26 (median 2.5). Copy number analysis in the solid tumor cohort identified 46 amplifications and 35 deletions. We identified 26 clinically actionable variants (levels 1-3) annotated by OncoKB, distributed across 20 out of 46 cases (40%), in the solid tumor cohort. Allele frequencies of ESR1 and FOXA1 mutations correlated with CA.27.29 levels in patient-matched blood draws.; CONCLUSIONS: In solid tumor biopsies and ctDNA, MammaSeq detects clinically actionable mutations (OncoKB levels 1-3) in 22/46 (48%) solid tumors and in 4/14 (29%) of ctDNA samples. MammaSeq is a targeted panel suitable for clinically actionable mutation detection in breast cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic profiling of colorectal cancer aims to identify actionable somatic mutations but can also discover incidental germline findings.; OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the detection of pathogenic germline variants that confer heritable cancer predisposition.; DESIGN: This was a retrospective study.; SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a tertiary-referral institution.; PATIENTS: Between 2012 and 2015, 1000 patients with advanced cancer underwent targeted exome sequencing of a 202-gene panel. The subgroup of 151 patients with advanced colorectal cancer who underwent matched tumor-normal (blood) sequencing formed our study cohort.; INTERVENTIONS: Germline variants in 46 genes associated with hereditary cancer predisposition were classified according to a defined algorithm based on in silico predictions of pathogenicity. Patients with presumed pathogenic variants were examined for type of mutation, as well as clinical, pedigree, and clinical genetic testing data.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured detection of pathogenic germline variants.; RESULTS: A total of 1910 distinct germline variants were observed in 151 patients. After filtering, 15 pathogenic germline variants (9.9%) were found in 15 patients, arising from 9 genes of varying penetrance for colorectal cancer (APC (n = 2; 13%), ATM (n = 1; 6%), BRCA1 (n = 2; 13%), CDH1 (n = 2; 13%), CHEK2 (n = 4; 27%), MSH2 (n = 1; 7%), MSH6 (n = 1; 7%), NF2 (n = 1; 7%), and TP53 (n = 1; 7%)). Patients with pathogenic variants were diagnosed at a younger age than those without (median, 45 vs 52 y; p = 0.03). Of the 15 patients, 7 patients (46.7%) with variants in low/moderate- penetrant genes for colorectal cancer would likely have not been tested based on clinical and pedigree criteria, where 2 harbored clinically actionable variants (CDH1 and NF2, 28.5% of 7).; LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its small sample size and advanced-stage patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-normal sequencing can incidentally discover clinically unsuspected germline variants that confer cancer predisposition in 9.9% of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Precision medicine should integrate clinical cancer genetics to inform and interpret the actionability of germline variants and to provide follow-up care to mutation carriers.

AB CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are highly polymorphic pharmacogenes; however, clinically actionable genetic variability in drug metabolism due to these genes has been limited to a few common alleles. The identification and functional characterization of less-common open reading frame sequence variation might help to individualize therapy with drugs that are substrates for the enzymes encoded by these genes. The present study identified seven uncharacterized variants each in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 using next-generation sequence data for 1013 subjects, and functionally characterized the encoded proteins. Constructs were created and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells for the assay of protein concentration and enzyme activities using fluorometric substrates and liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry with tolbutamide (CYP2C9) and (S)-mephenytoin (CYP2C19) as prototypic substrates. The results were compared with the SIFT, Polyphen, and Provean functional prediction software programs. Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) activities were also determined. Positive correlations were observed between protein content and fluorometric enzyme activity for variants of CYP2C9 (P < 0.05) and CYP2C19 (P < 0.0005). However, CYP2C9 709G>C and CYP2C19 65A>G activities were much lower than predicted based on protein content. Substrate intrinsic clearance values for CYP2C9 218C>T, 343A>C, and CYP2C19 337G>A, 518C>T, 556C>T, and 557G>A were less than 25% of wild-type allozymes. CPR activity levels were similar for all variants. In summary, sequencing of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in 1013 subjects identified low-frequency variants that had not previously been functionally characterized. In silico predictions were not always consistent with functional assay results. These observations emphasize the need for high-throughput methods for pharmacogene variant mutagenesis and functional characterization.

Family medicine has long valued an ecological perspective of health, partnering with families and communities. However, both the quantity and degree of continued health disparities requires that family medicine intentionally work toward improvement in health equity. In recognition of this, Family Medicine for America's Health (FMAHealth) formed a Health Equity Tactic Team (HETT). The team's charge was to address primary care's capacity to improve health equity by developing action-oriented approaches accessible to all family physicians. The HETT has produced a number of projects. These include the Starfield II Summit, the focus of which was "Primary Care's Role in Achieving Health Equity." Multidisciplinary thought leaders shared their work around health equity, and actionable interventions were developed. These formed the basis of subsequent work by the HETT. This includes the Health Equity Toolkit, designed for a broad interdisciplinary audience of learners to learn to improve care systems, reduce disparities, and improve patient outcomes. The HETT is also building a business case for health equity. This has focused efforts on demonstrating to the private sector an economic argument for health equity. The HETT has formed a close partnership with the American Academy of Family Physicians' (AAFP's) Center for Diversity and Health Equity (CDHE), collaborating on numerous efforts to increase awareness of health equity. The team has also focused on engaging leadership in all eight US national family medicine organizations to participate in its activities and to ensure that health equity remains a top priority in its leadership. Looking ahead, family medicine will be required to continuously engage with government and nongovernment agencies, academic centers, and the private sector to create partnerships to systematically tackle health inequities.

AB Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) inhibitors were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the NOTCH1 locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 inhibitor reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological inhibitor-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001-induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 inhibitors function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.

AB Most cases of maternal deaths could be avoided with timely access to quality healthcare, but a key challenge in addressing quality of care in maternal health, is the lack of accurate data. We present a review of the difficulties of collecting and analyzing maternal health data. We propose a comprehensive informatics monitoring framework to track progress on the achievement of the international targets and priorities toward ending preventable maternal mortality and improving maternal and child health, that at the same time builds capacity at institutional and country level to collect indicators and to generate actionable and comparable knowledge that facilitates analysis, research, and evidence-based decision making.

AB It is estimated that 6.1 million people with recent injecting drug use (PWID) are living with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although HCV-related morbidity and mortality among PWID continues to increase, the advent of direct acting antiviral (DAA) HCV regimens with cure rates >95% provides an opportunity to reverse the rising burden of disease. Additionally, given evidence that opioid substitution therapy and high-coverage needle and syringe programs can reduce HCV incidence by up to 80%, there is an opportunity to reduce HCV transmission with increased coverage of harm reduction services. However, there are significant patient, provider, health system, structural, and societal barriers that impede access to HCV prevention and care for PWID. The International Network on Hepatitis in Substance Users (INHSU), in collaboration with the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, Sexual Health Medicine (ASHM), Harm Reduction International, the Canadian Network on Hepatitis C, Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse, the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, Medecins du Monde and CATIE, held a roundtable discussion prior to the Harm Reduction Conference in Montreal, Canada on 13th May 2017 to discuss how to improve HCV prevention and care for PWID. Over 100 international researchers, practitioners, policy makers, advocates, and affected community members came together to discuss shared priorities for action, develop actionable next steps and to create partnerships to enable application of priorities. This paper highlights the key priority areas identified by participants including: enhancing global coverage of harm reduction services; addressing punitive drug policies; ensuring access to affordable HCV diagnostics and treatment; improving the evidence-base for HCV prevention, testing, linkage to care and treatment; implementing integrated HCV programs; advancing peer-based models of HCV care; and tackling social determinants of health inequalities for PWID. This paper also highlights the recommended actions for each priority identified by the participants from this roundtable. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma, which classically presents as an aggressive and rapidly enlarging tumor over the distal extremities of children in their first year of life. The presence of ETV6 and NTRK3 gene rearrangement is characteristic of IFS, which can be detected on routine fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing. Patients with IFS typically respond well to surgical resection and chemotherapy and have an overall survival of 90%. In this report, we outline the use of integrative clinical sequencing (ICS) including RNA-seq in a patient with refractory, metastatic IFS to reveal an unusual fusion (LMNA-NTRK1), not detected by routine FISH testing, which was treated with oral crizotinib and resulted in a complete and durable long-term response. This study highlights the utility of ICS in identifying cryptic gene fusions, especially in refractory malignancies, and demonstrates how such information can be used to select targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations. © 2019 Bender et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB OBJECTIVE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is underidentified and misidentified in the Latino community, and numerous barriers limit this community's ability to access quality health care for ASD. Appreciative inquiry/boot camp translation (AI/BCT) is a novel method of community engagement that can be used within community-based participatory research partnerships. AI/BCT uses qualitative methods to uncover strategies that the community is already successfully using and develops actionable messages to increase the use of those strategies throughout the community. We describe this method and outline how it is likely to be more effective at reducing disparities related to ASDs in the Latino community than traditional methods.; CONCLUSION: AI/BCT is a promising method of community engagement that is responsive to cultural differences. It is a strength-based approach focused on increasing the use of strategies that already work within the community. Therefore, it has the potential to reduce health disparities in the Latino community who have loved ones with autism ASD much more rapidly than traditional methods of inquiry.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many hospitalized adolescents are at increased risk for pregnancy complications due to an underlying medical condition, however sexual risk assessment is not consistently performed in this setting. While adolescents and their parents are supportive of sexual health discussion in the inpatient setting, a thorough understanding of factors that influence provision of this care among pediatric hospital physicians is lacking. This formative information is needed to facilitate efforts to improve and standardize clinical care provision. Our objective is to assess the frequency and factors that influence the provision of adolescent sexual and reproductive care by pediatric hospitalists.; METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional computerized survey of hospitalists at 5 pediatric hospitals who cared for ≥1 adolescent (14-21 years old) in the past year. Sexual and reproductive care practices were assessed by using a 76-item novel survey informed by the theory of planned behavior. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data.; RESULTS: Sixty-eight pediatric hospitalists participated (49% response rate): 78% were women and 65% were aged <40 years. Most (69%) reported treating >46 adolescents annually, including many who are at an increased risk for pregnancy complications due to teratogenic medication use or a comorbid condition. A majority felt that sexual and reproductive services are appropriate, although many endorsed barriers, including concern about follow-up after emergency contraception (63%) and time constraints (53%). Most reported insufficient knowledge regarding contraception (59%), desired contraception education (57%), and were likely to increase contraceptive provision if provided education (63%). Hospitalists rarely provided condoms or referral for an intrauterine device.; CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric hospitalists frequently care for adolescents who are at risk for pregnancy complications and generally agree that reproductive care is appropriate in the inpatient setting. With these findings, we highlight the critical need for effective comprehensive reproductive health service interventions that are tailored to address the numerous actionable barriers identified in this study.

AB BACKGROUND: It is challenging to conduct and quickly disseminate findings from in-depth qualitative analyses, which can impede timely implementation of interventions because of its time-consuming methods. To better understand tradeoffs between the need for actionable results and scientific rigor, we present our method for conducting a framework-guided rapid analysis (RA) and a comparison of these findings to an in-depth analysis of interview transcripts.; METHODS: Set within the context of an evaluation of a successful academic detailing (AD) program for opioid prescribing in the Veterans Health Administration, we developed interview guides informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and interviewed 10 academic detailers (clinical pharmacists) and 20 primary care providers to elicit detail about successful features of the program. For the RA, verbatim transcripts were summarized using a structured template (based on CFIR); summaries were subsequently consolidated into matrices by participant type to identify aspects of the program that worked well and ways to facilitate implementation elsewhere. For comparison purposes, we later conducted an in-depth analysis of the transcripts. We described our RA approach and qualitatively compared the RA and deductive in-depth analysis with respect to consistency of themes and resource intensity.; RESULTS: Integrating the CFIR throughout the RA and in-depth analysis was helpful for providing structure and consistency across both analyses. Findings from the two analyses were consistent. The most frequently coded constructs from the in-depth analysis aligned well with themes from the RA, and the latter methods were sufficient and appropriate for addressing the primary evaluation goals. Our approach to RA was less resource-intensive than the in-depth analysis, allowing for timely dissemination of findings to our operations partner that could be integrated into ongoing implementation.; CONCLUSIONS: In-depth analyses can be resource-intensive. If consistent with project needs (e.g., to quickly produce information to inform ongoing implementation or to comply with a policy mandate), it is reasonable to consider using RA, especially when faced with resource constraints. Our RA provided valid findings in a short timeframe, enabling identification of actionable suggestions for our operations partner.

AB PURPOSE: Radiation-associated sarcomas (RAS) are considered to have a poor prognosis. Although the incidence is anticipated to rise, contemporary data regarding predictors of outcomes are few. We performed a retrospective analysis to identify RAS prognostic factors and subset analyses for radiation-associated angiosarcoma arising after treatment for breast cancer (RAAB) and other RAS subtypes (other-RAS).; METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with localized RAS evaluated at an institutional multidisciplinary sarcoma clinic were identified. Clinical and histologic review was performed, and outcomes were assessed to identify prognostic features. A subset of cases underwent molecular analysis by next-generation sequencing.; RESULTS: Among 176 patients, histologic subtypes of RAS included angiosarcoma (41%), undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma (40%), leiomyosarcoma (8%), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (6%), and osteosarcoma (2%). Sixty-seven patients (38%) had RAAB, and 109 (62%) had other-RAS. RAAB had significantly shorter latency from time of initial radiation compared with other-RAS (8 vs. 15years; P<.001). Treatment approaches included surgery (91%), chemotherapy (44%), and radiation therapy (27%). Median follow-up was 3.2years; 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74%. On multivariate analysis, positive margins (P<.0001), deep tumor location (intrathoracic/intra-abdominal, P=.002), and high grade (P<.0001) were associated with worse OS. In particular, 3-year OS with negative versus positive margins was 90% versus 66%. Patients with RAAB versus other-RAS showed a trend for higher 3-year OS (84% vs 68%; P=.09), significantly higher 3-year metastasis-free survival (82% vs 67%; P=.001), but similar 3-year local recurrence-free survival (54% vs 61%; P=.28). Next-generation sequencing identified overall low tumor mutational burden, recurrent MYC amplification in RAAB, and few clinically actionable mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Margin negative excision, superficial tumor location, and low tumor grade are determinants of improved OS for RAS, suggesting that complete surgical excision, when possible, is an optimal component of treatment. RAAB is a clinicopathologically distinct type of RAS with shorter latency from initial RT, different recurrence patterns, and when aggressively managed has potentially better outcomes compared with other-RAS.

AB Interpreting discourses among implementers of what is termed a "landscape approach" enables us to learn from their experience to improve conservation and development outcomes. We use Q-methodology to explore the perspectives of a group of experts in the landscape approach, both from academic and implementation fields, on what hinderances are in place to the realisation of achieving sustainable landscape management in Indonesia. The results show that, at a generic level, "corruption" and "lack of transparency and accountability" rank as the greatest constraints on landscape functionality. Biophysical factors, such as topography and climate change, rank as the least constraining factors. When participants considered a landscape with which they were most familiar, the results changed: the rapid change of regulations, limited local human capacity and inaccessible data on economic risks increased, while the inadequacy of democratic institutions, "overlapping laws" and "corruption" decreased. The difference indicates some fine-tuning of generic perceptions to the local context and may also reflect different views on what is achievable for landscape approach practitioners. Overall, approximately 55% of variance is accounted for by five discourse factors for each trial. Four overlapped and two discourses were discrete enough to merit different discourse labels. We labelled the discourses (1) social exclusionists, (2) state view, (3) community view, (4) integrationists, (5) democrats, and (6) neoliberals. Each discourse contains elements actionable at the landscape scale, as well as exogenous issues that originate at national and global scales. Actionable elements that could contribute to improving governance included trust building, clarified resource rights and responsibilities, and inclusive representation in management. The landscape sustainability discourses studied here suggests that landscape approach "learners" must focus on ways to remedy poor governance if they are to achieve sustainability and multi-functionality.

AB OBJECTIVES: Public health and social services spending have been shown to improve health outcomes at the county level, although there are significant state and regional variations in such spending. Texas offers an important opportunity for examining nuances in the patterns of association between local government health and social services spending and population health outcomes. The primary objectives of this study were to describe local investments in education, health, and social services at the county-area level for all of Texas from 2002 through 2012 and to examine how changes in local investment over time were associated with changes in health outcomes.; METHODS: We used two large secondary data sources for this study. First, US Census Bureau data were used to measure annual spending by all local governments on public hospitals, community health care and public health, and >1 dozen social services. Second, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps data measured county health outcomes. We performed regression models to examine the association between increases in local government spending and a county's health outcomes ranking 4 years later. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models accounted for mean spending in each category, county health factors ranking, and county and state random effects.; RESULTS: Local governments in Texas spent an average of $4717 per capita across all health and social services. Although spending was relatively consistent across 2002-2012, there was notable variation in spending across counties and services. Regression models found that changes in four spending categories were associated with significant improvements in health outcomes: fire and ambulance, community health care and public health, housing and community development, and libraries. For each, an additional one-time investment of $15 per capita was associated with a 1-spot improvement in statewide county health rankings within 4 years.; CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence regarding the association between social services spending and health outcomes may not yield sufficiently granular data for policy makers within a single state. Investments in certain social services in Texas were associated with improvements in health outcomes, as measured by improvements in the County Health Rankings, in the years subsequent to spending increases. Similar analyses in other states and regions may yield actionable avenues for policy makers to improve population health.

AB Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is common in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Targeted therapy specifically directed towards EGFR has been an area of keen interest in head and neck cancer research, as EGFR is potentially an integration point for convergent signaling. Despite the latest advancements in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics against EGFR, the survival rates of patients with advanced head and neck cancer remain disappointing due to anti-EGFR resistance. This review article will discuss recent multilateral efforts to discover and validate actionable strategies that involve signaling pathways in heterogenous head and neck cancer and to overcome anti-EGFR resistance in the era of precision medicine. Particularly, this review will discuss in detail the issue of cancer metabolism, which has recently emerged as a novel mechanism by which head and neck cancer may be successfully controlled according to different perspectives.

AB BACKGROUND: International guidelines for variant interpretation in Mendelian disease set stringent criteria to report a variant as (likely) pathogenic, prioritising control of false-positive rate over test sensitivity and diagnostic yield. Genetic testing is also more likely informative in individuals with well-characterised variants from extensively studied European-ancestry populations. Inherited cardiomyopathies are relatively common Mendelian diseases that allow empirical calibration and assessment of this framework.; METHODS: We compared rare variants in large hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cohorts (up to 6179 cases) to reference populations to identify variant classes with high prior likelihoods of pathogenicity, as defined by etiological fraction (EF). We analysed the distribution of variants using a bespoke unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify gene regions in which variants are significantly clustered in cases.; RESULTS: Analysis of variant distribution identified regions in which variants are significantly enriched in cases and variant location was a better discriminator of pathogenicity than generic computational functional prediction algorithms. Non-truncating variant classes with an EF ≥0.95 were identified in five established HCM genes. Applying this approach leads to an estimated 14-20% increase in cases with actionable HCM variants, i.e. variants classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic that might be used for predictive testing in probands' relatives.; CONCLUSIONS: When found in a patient confirmed to have disease, novel variants in some genes and regions are empirically shown to have a sufficiently high probability of pathogenicity to support a "likely pathogenic" classification, even without additional segregation or functional data. This could increase the yield of high confidence actionable variants, consistent with the framework and recommendations of current guidelines. The techniques outlined offer a consistent and unbiased approach to variant interpretation for Mendelian disease genetic testing. We propose adaptations to ACMG/AMP guidelines to incorporate such evidence in a quantitative and transparent manner.

AB The response of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the first-line conventional combination therapy is highly variable, reflecting the elevated heterogeneity of the disease. The genetic alterations underlying this heterogeneity have been thoroughly characterized through omic approaches requiring elevated efforts and costs. In order to translate the knowledge of CRC molecular heterogeneity into a practical clinical approach, we utilized a simplified Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based platform to screen a cohort of 77 patients treated with first-line conventional therapy. Samples were sequenced using a panel of hotspots and targeted regions of 22 genes commonly involved in CRC. This revealed 51 patients carrying actionable gene mutations, 22 of which carried druggable alterations. These mutations were frequently associated with additional genetic alterations. To take into account this molecular complexity and assisted by an unbiased bioinformatic analysis, we defined three subgroups of patients carrying distinct molecular patterns. We demonstrated these three molecular subgroups are associated with a different response to first-line conventional combination therapies. The best outcome was achieved in patients exclusively carrying mutations on TP53 and/or RAS genes. By contrast, in patients carrying mutations in any of the other genes, alone or associated with mutations of TP53/RAS, the expected response is much worse compared to patients with exclusive TP53/RAS mutations. Additionally, our data indicate that the standard approach has limited efficacy in patients without any mutations in the genes included in the panel. In conclusion, we identified a reliable and easy-to-use approach for a simplified molecular-based stratification of mCRC patients that predicts the efficacy of the first-line conventional combination therapy.

AB Across clinical trials, T cell expansion and persistence following adoptive cell transfer (ACT) have correlated with superior patient outcomes. Herein, we undertook a pan-cancer analysis to identify actionable ligand-receptor pairs capable of compromising T cell durability following ACT. We discovered that FASLG, the gene encoding the apoptosis-inducing ligand FasL, is overexpressed within the majority of human tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Further, we uncovered that Fas, the receptor for FasL, is highly expressed on patient-derived T cells used for clinical ACT. We hypothesized that a cognate Fas-FasL interaction within the TME might limit both T cell persistence and antitumor efficacy. We discovered that genetic engineering of Fas variants impaired in the ability to bind FADD functioned as dominant negative receptors (DNRs), preventing FasL-induced apoptosis in Fas-competent T cells. T cells coengineered with a Fas DNR and either a T cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor exhibited enhanced persistence following ACT, resulting in superior antitumor efficacy against established solid and hematologic cancers. Despite increased longevity, Fas DNR-engineered T cells did not undergo aberrant expansion or mediate autoimmunity. Thus, T cell-intrinsic disruption of Fas signaling through genetic engineering represents a potentially universal strategy to enhance ACT efficacy across a broad range of human malignancies.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite numerous national programs intended to ensure patients receive high-quality surgical care, contemporaneous quality improvement initiatives (QIIs) are limited by the challenges associated with developing universal consensus about how best to define "quality" and the identification of appropriate and actionable quality measures.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Donabedian conceptual model for the evaluation of health care quality, representative examples of existing surgical QIIs at each level of health care (i.e., structure, process, and outcome) were identified, and the effectiveness of these programs was discussed.; RESULTS: Surgical volume-based measures are a common structural quality indicator. It remains unclear whether volume-based QIIs, such as "Take the Volume Pledge" and the Leapfrog Group's Evidence-Based Hospital Referral initiative, would improve surgical outcomes or potentially exacerbate existing health care disparities. QIIs focused on processes of care, such as the Surgical Care Improvement Project, are frequently effective at improving measure compliance without clearly improving care quality. Risk-adjusted outcome measures remain common quality indicators. But, relevant procedure-specific outcomes are lacking, and continuing to rely on perioperative morbidity and mortality may not provide the most robust picture of surgical quality.; CONCLUSIONS: Data regarding the effectiveness of existing QIIs suggest there may be important opportunities to either select measures that more accurately reflect quality surgical care or enhance the manner in which current quality indicators are measured and reported to better capture the complex dynamics of surgical services at the point of care.

AB Chordoma is a primary bone cancer with no approved therapy1. The identification of therapeutic targets in this disease has been challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of clinically actionable somatic mutations in chordoma tumors2,3. Here we describe the discovery of therapeutically targetable chordoma dependencies via genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening and focused small-molecule sensitivity profiling. These systematic approaches reveal that the developmental transcription factor T (brachyury; TBXT) is the top selectively essential gene in chordoma, and that transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors targeting CDK7/12/13 and CDK9 potently suppress chordoma cell proliferation. In other cancer types, transcriptional CDK inhibitors have been observed to downregulate highly expressed, enhancer-associated oncogenic transcription factors4,5. In chordoma, we find that T is associated with a 1.5-Mb region containing 'super-enhancers' and is the most highly expressed super-enhancer-associated transcription factor. Notably, transcriptional CDK inhibition leads to preferential and concentration-dependent downregulation of cellular brachyury protein levels in all models tested. In vivo, CDK7/12/13-inhibitor treatment substantially reduces tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate small-molecule targeting of brachyury transcription factor addiction in chordoma, identify a mechanism of T gene regulation that underlies this therapeutic strategy, and provide a blueprint for applying systematic genetic and chemical screening approaches to discover vulnerabilities in genomically quiet cancers.

AB A novel intervention or new clinical program must achieve and sustain its operational and clinical goals. To demonstrate successfully optimizing health care value, providers and other stakeholders must longitudinally measure and report these tracked relevant associated outcomes. This includes clinicians and perioperative health services researchers who chose to participate in these process improvement and quality improvement efforts ("play in this space"). Statistical process control is a branch of statistics that combines rigorous sequential, time-based analysis methods with graphical presentation of performance and quality data. Statistical process control and its primary tool-the control chart-provide researchers and practitioners with a method of better understanding and communicating data from health care performance and quality improvement efforts. Statistical process control presents performance and quality data in a format that is typically more understandable to practicing clinicians, administrators, and health care decision makers and often more readily generates actionable insights and conclusions. Health care quality improvement is predicated on statistical process control. Undertaking, achieving, and reporting continuous quality improvement in anesthesiology, critical care, perioperative medicine, and acute and chronic pain management all fundamentally rely on applying statistical process control methods and tools. Thus, the present basic statistical tutorial focuses on the germane topic of statistical process control, including random (common) causes of variation versus assignable (special) causes of variation: Six Sigma versus Lean versus Lean Six Sigma, levels of quality management, run chart, control charts, selecting the applicable type of control chart, and analyzing a control chart. Specific attention is focused on quasi-experimental study designs, which are particularly applicable to process improvement and quality improvement efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: It is critical to minimize the time between the first medical contact and primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.; AIMS: To identify factors associated with a delay of>120min between first medical contact and primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.; METHODS: Data were analysed from a regional French registry of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction<24h after symptom onset. Patients (n=2081) were grouped according to transfer times from first medical contact to primary percutaneous coronary intervention:>120min; or≤120min. Independent predictors of delay were identified by univariate and multivariable analyses.; RESULTS: The median transfer time from first medical contact to primary percutaneous coronary intervention was 112min; 892 patients (42.9%) had a transfer time>120min. A delay of>120min was significantly associated with:≥75km distance from interventional cardiology centre at symptom onset (odds ratio 7.9); more than one medical practitioner involved before interventional cardiology centre (odds ratio 4.5); first admission to a hospital without an interventional cardiology centre (odds ratio 2.9); absence of emergency call (odds ratio 1.6); ≥90min between symptom onset and first medical contact (odds ratio 1.3); Killip class at admission>1 (odds ratio 1.8); lateral ischaemia (odds ratio 1.8); diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 1.6); and hypertension (odds ratio 1.3).; CONCLUSIONS: In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, a transfer time from first medical contact to primary percutaneous coronary intervention of>120min was associated with geographic, systemic and comorbid factors, several of which appear reasonably actionable.

AB BACKGROUND: Regulatory approval of next generation sequencing (NGS) by the FDA is advancing the use of genomic-based precision medicine for the therapeutic management of cancer as standard care. Recent FDA guidance for the classification of genomic variants based on clinical evidence to aid clinicians in understanding the actionability of identified variants provided by comprehensive NGS panels has also been set forth. In this retrospective analysis, we interpreted and applied the FDA variant classification guidance to comprehensive NGS testing performed for advanced cancer patients and assessed oncologist agreement with NGS test treatment recommendations.; METHODS: NGS comprehensive genomic profiling was performed in a CLIA certified lab (657 completed tests for 646 patients treated at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center) between June 2016 and June 2017. Physician treatment recommendations made within 120days post-test were gathered from tested patients' medical records and classified as targeted therapy, precision medicine clinical trial, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy/radiation, surgery, transplant, or non-therapeutic (hospice, surveillance, or palliative care). Agreement between NGS test report targeted therapy recommendations based on the FDA variant classification and physician targeted therapy treatment recommendations were evaluated.; RESULTS: Excluding variants contraindicating targeted therapy (i.e., KRAS or NRAS mutations), at least one variant with FDA level 1 companion diagnostic supporting evidence as the most actionable was identified in 14% of tests, with physicians most frequently recommending targeted therapy (48%) for patients with these results. This stands in contrast to physicians recommending targeted therapy based on test results with FDA level 2 (practice guideline) or FDA level 3 (clinical trial or off label) evidence as the most actionable result (11 and 4%, respectively).; CONCLUSIONS: We found an appropriate "dose-response" relationship between the strength of clinical evidence supporting biomarker-directed targeted therapy based on application of FDA guidance for NGS test variant classification, and subsequent treatment recommendations made by treating physicians. In view of recent changes at FDA, it is paramount to define regulatory grounds and medical policy coverage for NGS testing based on this guidance.

AB The finalization of the Human Genome Project in 2003 paved the way for a deeper understanding of cancer, favouring a faster progression towards "personalized" medicine. Research in oncology has progressively focused on the sequencing of cancer genomes, to better understand the genetic basis of tumorigenesis and identify actionable alterations to guide cancer therapy. Thanks to the development of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) techniques, sequencing of tumoral DNA is today technically easier, faster and cheaper. Commercially available NGS panels enable the detection of single or global genomic alterations, namely gene mutation and mutagenic burden, both on germline and somatic DNA, potentially predicting the response or resistance to cancer treatments. Profiling of tumor DNA is nowadays a standard in cancer research and treatment. In this review we discuss the history, techniques and applications of NGS in cancer care, under a "personalized tailored therapy" perspective. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB INTRODUCTION: The treatment and management of prostate cancer continues to evolve; newer classes of agents and combination therapies are being developed and some are being investigated in early phase clinical trials.; AREAS COVERED: We discuss investigational hormonal agents for the treatment of prostate cancer and focus primarily on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in early stage trials. We look at agents that target the hormonal axis, including anti-androgens, gonadotropins, estrogenic agents and progestogenic agents and other non-hormonal agents often used in combination with LHRH agonists. We review these candidates in the specific clinical niche in which they might find utility.; EXPERT OPINION: Of all candidate compounds being evaluated in clinical trials, very few will receive FDA approval. Few, if any of the investigational agents discussed here will be used routinely in clinical practice for treating prostate cancer. Recognizing the reasons for the failure of agents to advance to later stage trials is important. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer pathogenesis, including various points in the HGPA and parallel pathways, will help identify potentially actionable targets.

AB The massive consumption of antibiotics in the ICU is responsible for substantial ecological side effects that promote the dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) in this environment. Strikingly, up to half of ICU patients receiving empirical antibiotic therapy have no definitively confirmed infection, while de-escalation and shortened treatment duration are insufficiently considered in those with documented sepsis, highlighting the potential benefit of implementing antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) and other quality improvement initiatives. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the available evidence, emerging options, and unsolved controversies for the optimization of antibiotic therapy in the ICU. Published data notably support the need for better identification of patients at risk of MDRB infection, more accurate diagnostic tools enabling a rule-in/rule-out approach for bacterial sepsis, an individualized reasoning for the selection of single-drug or combination empirical regimen, the use of adequate dosing and administration schemes to ensure the attainment of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics targets, concomitant source control when appropriate, and a systematic reappraisal of initial therapy in an attempt to minimize collateral damage on commensal ecosystems through de-escalation and treatment-shortening whenever conceivable. This narrative review also aims at compiling arguments for the elaboration of actionable ASP in the ICU, including improved patient outcomes and a reduction in antibiotic-related selection pressure that may help to control the dissemination of MDRB in this healthcare setting.

AB OBJECTIVE: The act of predicting clinical endpoints and patient trajectories based on past and current states is on the precipice of a technological revolution. This systematic review summarises the available evidence describing healthcare provider opinions and preferences with respect to the use of clinical prediction rules. The primary goal of this work is to inform the design and implementation of future systems, and secondarily to identify gaps for the development of clinician education programs.; METHODS: Five databases were systematically searched in May 2016 for studies collecting empirical opinions of healthcare providers regarding clinical prediction rule usage. Reference lists were scanned for additional eligible materials and an update search was made in August 2017. Data was extracted on high-level study features, before in-depth thematic analysis was performed.; RESULTS: 45 articles were identified from 9 countries. Most studies utilised surveys (28) or interviews (14). Fewer employed focus groups (9) or formal usability testing (4). Three high-level themes were identified, which form the basis of healthcare provider opinions of clinical prediction rules and their implementation - utility, credibility and usability.; CONCLUSIONS: Some of the objections and preferences stated by healthcare providers are inherent to the nature of the clinical problem addressed, which may or may not be within the designer's capacity to change; however, others (in particular - actionability, validation, integration and provision of high quality education materials) should be considered by prediction rule designers and implementation teams, in order to increase user acceptance and improve uptake of these tools. We summarise these findings across the clinical prediction rule lifecycle and pose questions for the rule developers, in order to produce tools that are more likely to successfully translate into clinical practice.

AB Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. The complex and disorganized tumor microenvironment makes it very difficult to treat this disease. The most common in vitro drug screening method now is based on 2D culture models which poorly represent actual tumors. Therefore, many 3D tumor models which are more physiologically relevant have been developed to conduct in vitro drug screening and alleviate this situation. Among all these models, the microfluidic tumor model has the unique advantage of recapitulating the tumor microenvironment in a comparatively easier and representative fashion. While there are many review papers available on the related topic of microfluidic tumor models, in this review we aim to focus more on the possibility of generating "clinically actionable information" from these microfluidic systems, besides scientific insight. Our topics cover the tumor microenvironment, conventional 2D and 3D cultures, animal models, and microfluidic tumor models, emphasizing their link to anti-cancer drug discovery and personalized medicine.

AB Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy for which optimal therapeutic approaches are poorly characterized. Using computational biology modeling (CBM) in conjunction with genomic data from cell lines and individual patients, we generated disease-specific protein network maps that were used to identify unique characteristics associated with the mutational profiles of ETP-ALL compared to non-ETP-ALL (T-ALL) cases and simulated cellular responses to a digital library of FDA-approved and investigational agents. Genomics-based classification of ETP-ALL patients using CBM had a prediction sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 87%, respectively. This analysis identified key genomic and pathway characteristics that are distinct in ETP-ALL including deletion of nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1), mutations of which are used to direct therapeutic decisions in acute myeloid leukemia. Computational simulations based on mutational profiles of 62 ETP-ALL patient models identified 87 unique targeted combination therapies in 56 of the 62 patients despite actionable mutations being present in only 37% of ETP-ALL patients. Shortlisted two-drug combinations were predicted to be synergistic in 11 profiles and were validated by in vitro chemosensitivity assays. In conclusion, computational modeling was able to identify unique biomarkers and pathways for ETP-ALL, and identify new drug combinations for potential clinical testing. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB The use of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled the analysis of a wide spectrum of somatic mutations in tumors. This analysis can be carried out using various strategies including the use of small panels of focused, clinically actionable genes, large panels of cancer-related genes, whole exomes, and the entire genome. One of the main goals in these analyses is to identify key mutations in these tumors that drive the oncogenic process. Depending on the gene, mutations can have altering effects, such as loss of function mutations in tumor suppressor genes, to mutations that activate genes such as kinases involved with cell cycle progression or proliferation. Once the sequencing process is complete, and the alignment of the large collection of reads to the reference genome and variant calling has been carried out, one is left with a large collection of variants. The challenge then becomes assigning where the variant resides in the genome with respect to coding regions, splice site regions, regulatory regions, and what potential functional effect these variants may have on the resulting protein. Other helpful information includes determining if the variant has been identified before, and if so, the tumor type associated with the variant. In addition, if the tumor profiling experiment is not conducted with a matched specimen representing the inherited genome, various tools are helpful to determine if the variant is likely to be an inherited polymorphism or a somatic event. In this chapter, we review the various tools available for annotating variants to assist in filtering down and prioritizing the hundreds to thousands of variants down to the key variants likely to be driver mutations and relevant to the tumor being profiled.

AB Dementia is a neurological and cognitive condition that affects millions of people around the world. At any given time in the United Kingdom, 1 in 4 hospital beds are occupied by a person with dementia, while about 22% of these hospital admissions are due to preventable causes. In this paper we discuss using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and in-home sensory devices in combination with machine learning techniques to monitor health and well-being of people with dementia. This will allow us to provide more effective and preventative care and reduce preventable hospital admissions. One of the unique aspects of this work is combining environmental data with physiological data collected via low cost in-home sensory devices to extract actionable information regarding the health and well-being of people with dementia in their own home environment. We have worked with clinicians to design our machine learning algorithms where we focused on developing solutions for real-world settings. In our solutions, we avoid generating too many alerts/alarms to prevent increasing the monitoring and support workload. We have designed an algorithm to detect Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) which is one of the top five reasons of hospital admissions for people with dementia (around 9% of hospital admissions for people with dementia in the UK). To develop the UTI detection algorithm, we have used a Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) technique to extract latent factors from raw observation and use them for clustering and identifying the possible UTI cases. In addition, we have designed an algorithm for detecting changes in activity patterns to identify early symptoms of cognitive decline or health decline in order to provide personalised and preventative care services. For this purpose, we have used an Isolation Forest (iForest) technique to create a holistic view of the daily activity patterns. This paper describes the algorithms and discusses the evaluation of the work using a large set of real-world data collected from a trial with people with dementia and their caregivers.

AB Current therapeutic interventions for the treatment of respiratory infections are hampered by the evolution of multidrug resistance in pathogens as well as the lack of effective cellular targets. Despite the identification of multiple region-specific lung progenitor cells, the identity of molecules that might be therapeutically targeted in response to infections to promote activation of progenitor cell types remains elusive. Here, we report that loss of Abl1 specifically in SCGB1A1-expressing cells leads to a significant increase in the proliferation and differentiation of bronchiolar epithelial cells, resulting in dramatic expansion of an SCGB1A1+ airway cell population that coexpresses SPC, a marker for type II alveolar cells that promotes alveolar regeneration following bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore, treatment with an Abl-specific allosteric inhibitor enhanced regeneration of the alveolar epithelium and promoted accelerated recovery of mice following pneumonia. These data reveal a potential actionable target that may be exploited for efficient recovery after pathogen-induced infections.

AB Introduction: Feedback provides valuable input for improving physician performance. Conventionally, feedback is obtained from attending physicians; however, residents work in close contact with other members of the care team, especially nurses. Nurses may have more opportunity to directly observe trainees. In addition, they may value different behaviors and provide unique feedback. The objective of this study was to examine the nurse's perspective of resident performance in the emergency department.; Methods: This was a retrospective, mixed-methods study of nursing assessments of residents using a five-point scale from 1 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (outstanding) and providing comments. Analysis included descriptive statistics of the quantitative assessments and content analysis of the nursing comments by a group of attendings, residents, and nurses.; Results: Nurses assessed residents as above expectation or outstanding, especially for the categories of "How would you rate this resident's attitude?" (65%) and "Is this resident a team player?" (64%). Content analysis of the comments yielded nine themes including being kind, communication with nurses, being a team player, work ethic and efficiency, and respect for other team members. Of the comments made, 50% provided positive feedback, and the majority of comments (80%) were determined to be actionable.; Conclusion: Our data indicate that nurses provide feedback on residents' kindness, efficiency and communication. These two aspects of interacting in the healthcare setting may not be highlighted in conventional, attending provider feedback, yet they are clearly noted by the nurse's voice.

AB Introduction: Medical education is moving toward a competency-based framework with a focus on assessment using the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Milestones. Assessment of individual competencies through milestones can be challenging. While competencies describe characteristics of the person, the entrustable professional activities (EPAs) concept refers to work-related activities. EPAs would not replace the milestones but would be linked to them, integrating these frameworks. Many core specialties have already defined EPAs for resident trainees, but EPAs have not yet been created for emergency medicine (EM). This paper describes the development of milestone-linked EPAs for EM.; Methods: Ten EM educators from across North America formed a consensus working group to draft EM EPAs, using a modified Glaser state-of-the-art approach. A reactor panel with EPA experts from the United States, Canada and the Netherlands was created, and an iterative process with multiple revisions was performed based on reactor panel input. Following this, the EPAs were sent to the Council of Residency Directors for EM (CORD-EM) listserv for additional feedback.; Results: The product was 11 core EPAs that every trainee from every EM program should be able to perform independently by the time of graduation. Each EPA has associated knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors (KSAB), which are either milestones themselves or KSABs linked to individual milestones. We recognize that individual programs may have additional focus areas or work-based activities they want their trainees to achieve by graduation; therefore, programs are also encouraged to create additional program-specific EPAs.; Conclusion: This set of 11 core, EM-resident EPAs can be used as an assessment tool by EM residency programs, allowing supervising physicians to document the multiple entrustment decisions they are already making during clinical shifts with trainees. The KSAB list within each EPA could assist supervisors in giving specific, actionable feedback to trainees and allow trainees to use this list as an assessment-for-learning tool. Linking each KSAB to individual EM milestones allows EPAs to directly inform milestone assessment for clinical competency committees.

AB Introduction: Formative evaluations of clinical teaching for emergency medicine (EM) faculty are limited. The goal of this study was to develop a behaviorally-based tool for evaluating and providing feedback to EM faculty based on their clinical teaching skills during a shift.; Methods: We used a three-phase structured development process. Phase 1 used the nominal group technique with a group of faculty first and then with residents to generate potential evaluation items. Phase 2 included separate focus groups and used a modified Delphi technique with faculty and residents, as well as a group of experts to evaluate the items generated in Phase 1. Following this, residents classified the items into novice, intermediate, and advanced educator skills. Once items were determined for inclusion and subsequently ranked they were built into the tool by the investigators (Phase 3).; Results: The final instrument, the "Faculty Shift Card," is a behaviorally-anchored evaluation and feedback tool used to facilitate feedback to EM faculty about their teaching skills during a shift. The tool has four domains: teaching clinical decision-making; teaching interpersonal skills; teaching procedural skills; and general teaching strategies. Each domain contains novice, intermediate, and advanced sections with 2-5 concrete examples for each level of performance.; Conclusion: This structured process resulted in a well-grounded and systematically developed evaluation tool for EM faculty that can provide real-time actionable feedback to faculty and support improved clinical teaching.

AB This overview highlights the actionable near-term objectives for the TRN drawn from discussions in the breakout sessions. A major purpose of the symposium was to focus attention on establishing priorities, setting goals, and identifying the steps toward accomplishing those goals. Two major objectives were identified. One is to establish Turner syndrome as a priority area of research for the National Institutes of Health. Turner syndrome should not only be viewed as a rare disorder, but also as a model for common diseases that have a male sex bias in the general population attributable to the lack of a second X chromosome. Barriers to recognition of Turner syndrome as an important area of research were identified, and new approaches to enhancing visibility are discussed. The second major objective is to further development of the Turner Syndrome Research Registry (TSRR). This patient-powered research registry is a paradigm-shifting model for how human-based research can be improved through equal partnerships between researchers and study subjects. The TSRR is founded on an agreement that study participants are the ultimate owners of their personal data. The major challenges to establishing a maximally functional registry of this design were discussed, and a clear path forward was established. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The analysis of circulating cancer biomarkers in the form of liquid biopsies confers several potential benefits as compared to traditional surgical tissue sampling. As a common key anomaly strongly implicated across several cancer types, the BRAFV600E mutation is one of the most valuable oncogenic biomarkers available in liquid biopsies. Crucially, BRAFV600E is also an actionable mutation which could be arrested by clinically beneficial drug inhibitors. Yet, as is true for most single base disease mutations, current BRAFV600E detection in either its DNA or protein molecular state is still liable to false positive/negative outcomes, thus impacting patient treatment benefit. Here we present an integrated multi-molecular sensor (IMMS) for an entire sample-to-answer workflow from melanoma cell capture to simultaneous quantification of both intracellular BRAFV600E DNA and protein levels on a single platform. The IMMS combines (i) specific capture and release of circulating melanoma cells; (ii) electric field-induced cell lysis; (iii) simultaneous quantification of BRAFV600E DNA and protein levels. We investigated the IMMS system's analytical performance in cell capture, release and lysis, and intracellular BRAFV600E detection by ligase-mediated DNA amplification and antibody-based protein hybridization. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully demonstrated circulating BRAFV600E detection at both DNA and protein molecular levels in simulated melanoma plasma samples. With its capabilities in integrated and miniaturized analysis, the IMMS could lead the emergence of a new generation of multi-molecular lab-on-chip biosensors for enabling more accurate and extensive analysis of powerful circulating biomarkers in patient liquid biopsies.

AB Genomic sequencing provides many opportunities in newborn clinical care, but the challenges of interpreting and reporting newborn genomic sequencing (nGS) results need to be addressed for its broader and effective application. The BabySeq Project is a pilot randomized clinical trial that explores the medical, behavioral, and economic impacts of nGS in well newborns and those admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Here we present childhood-onset and actionable adult-onset disease risk, carrier status, and pharmacogenomics findings from nGS of 159 newborns in the BabySeq Project. nGS revealed a risk of childhood-onset disease in 15/159 (9.4%) newborns; none of the disease risks were anticipated based on the infants' known clinical or family histories. nGS also revealed actionable adult-onset disease risk in 3/85 (3.5%) newborns whose parents consented to receive this information. Carrier status for recessive diseases and pharmacogenomics variants were reported in 88% and 5% of newborns, respectively. Additional indication-based analyses were performed in 29/32 (91%) NICU newborns and 6/127 (5%) healthy newborns who later had presentations that prompted a diagnostic analysis. No variants that sufficiently explained the reason for the indications were identified; however, suspicious but uncertain results were reported in five newborns. Testing parental samples contributed to the interpretation and reporting of results in 13/159 (8%) newborns. Our results suggest that nGS can effectively detect risk and carrier status for a wide range of disorders that are not detectable by current newborn screening assays or predicted based on the infant's known clinical or family history, and the interpretation of results can substantially benefit from parental testing.

AB Nurses report significant gaps in communication among patients discharged from the hospital with home healthcare (HHC) services. The aim of this pilot study was to quantify the contents of HHC admission packets used to guide nurses' first home visit after hospital discharge. We evaluated 20 randomly selected charts of older adults admitted to HHC after a hospitalization for heart failure. Admission packets contained nearly 50 pages of material, which frequently included duplicate documents printed from the hospital-based electronic health record (EHR). Despite the plethora of documents, most packets omitted key information, such as patients' cognitive and functional status, and even discharge summaries, which would be relevant and actionable for HHC nurses. Moreover, admission packets contained multiple, often discordant, EHR-generated medication lists, which makes reconciliation challenging for nurses and puts vulnerable patients at risk for adverse drug events. Overall, there is an urgent need to improve health information exchange between hospitals and HHC agencies, which will simultaneously promote nurse efficiency and patient safety.

AB EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This article reports on a data-driven methodology for decision-making at a Veterans Affairs medical center (VAMC) to improve patient outcomes, specifically the 30-day standardized mortality ratio (SMR30). The quarterly strategic analytics for improvement and learning (SAIL) reports are used to visualize the data, study trends, provide actionable recommendations, and identify potential consequences.A case study using more than 4 years of data demonstrates the power of the methodology. After reviewing data and studying trends at other VAMCs, a decision is made to reduce the SMR30 value by 1%. In running correlation algorithms, in-hospital complications (IHC) are shown to be most closely correlated with SMR30. Modeling the results from 17 quarters' worth of data shows that a desired 1% change in SMR30 would require a targeted 18.6% decrease in IHC. This change, if accomplished, would yield good consequences on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus mitigation but potentially unintended consequences with catheter-associated urinary tract infections and patient safety indicators that would need to be monitored. This knowledge could enable healthcare leaders to make informed decisions of both potentially positive and unintended consequences that can be monitored and minimized. This study lays the groundwork for a healthy discussion among leaders, staff, and clinicians on the path forward, resources required, and-most importantly-a dashboard that reflects the progress each week rather than a quarterly SAIL report.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As part of Affordable Care Act, the Centers for Medicaid Services (CMS) recommend physicians provide patients with an After-Visit Summary (AVS) following a clinic visit. Information should be relevant and actionable with specific instructions regarding their visit and health. Until recently, this recommendation was included as part of meeting the standard for Stage 1 Meaningful Use for all physicians using electronic-health-record (EHR) technology. In 2016, CMS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to institute parts of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 Merit-based Incentive Payment System, which continues to focus on quality, resource use, and use of certified EHR technology. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of the AVS for patients seen at the Parkland Family Medicine Residency Clinic.; METHODS: Electronic medical records of 250 randomly selected patients seen at the Parkland Family Medicine Residency Clinic between July 2013 and July 2014 were reviewed using the 3 W's question format, a modified version of the National Patient Safety Foundation's "Ask Me 3 Program," designed to improve communication between patients and their health care providers.; RESULTS: The goal of the quality improvement study was to ensure that all patients receive a meaningful (relevant, accurate, and actionable) AVS after each clinic visit. Chart review indicated that 100% of patients received an AVS after each clinic visit. Of these patients, 51.2% were Spanish speaking, 47.2% English speaking, and 1.6% spoke neither English nor Spanish. Of the non-English-speaking patients, 84.8% received the AVS in their first language; the other 15.2% received the AVS in English. Sixteen percent (16%) of patients overall were considered to have received a nonmeaningful AVS. Reasons for the AVS not being meaningful included not containing any information on the patient's presenting problem (39.2%), physician intervention (35%), or plan of care (18.4%).; CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that although we demonstrate meaningful use of our EHR system, the content of the AVS needs to be improved on. © Copyright 2019 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB To evaluate how neurologists make decisions regarding chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), we conducted a cross-sectional quantitative survey of 100 community neurologists in the United States. Only 13% cited using the European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society guideline. In addition, variability in treatment approaches existed regarding the dose of IVIg used, the length of IVIg therapy before determining response, the outcome measures used to determine IVIg response, and the protocol for weaning off therapy. Forty-three percent reported giving doses that were lower than the recommended IVIg loading dose for CIDP. Many reported giving nonspecific patient education about the rationale of IVIg use and treatment duration. The finding that approximately half of community neurologists endorsed electrodiagnostic criteria that do not support CIDP diagnosis indicated difficulties relying heavily upon neurophysiologic studies in diagnostic guidelines. More education on CIDP diagnosis and treatment and a clear, actionable, clinically focused guideline would enhance best practices, particularly in the midst of high information flow and multiple guidelines.

AB The return of information from genomic sequencing in children, especially in early life, brings up complex issues around parental autonomy, the child's future autonomy, the best interest standard, and the best interests of the family. These issues are particularly important in considering the return of genomic results for adult-onset-only conditions in children. The BabySeq Project is a randomized trial used to explore the medical, behavioral, and economic impacts of integrating genomic sequencing into the care of newborns who are healthy or sick. We discuss a case in which a variant in a gene for an actionable, adult-onset-only condition was detected, highlighting the ethical issues surrounding the return of such finding in a newborn to the newborn's parents.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the understandability and actionability of audiovisual educational materials on diabetes in Korea using the Patient Education Materials Evaluation Tool (PEMAT), as well as determine the usefulness of these materials.; METHODS: A total of 85 audiovisual materials were collected from Korean websites of territory general hospitals, national health institutions, research associations, and major search engines relating to diabetes that were created between 2006 and 2015. Of these, 34 materials that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. Five trained researchers evaluated the materials independently.; RESULTS: More than half of the materials (58.8%) had been created by nongovernment organizations. Slightly more than half (n=19) of the audiovisual materials were streaming-style animation. The average PEMAT score (58.5%) for these materials was moderate. Compared to "understandability" ratings (49.5%), "actionability" ratings were low (31.4%); indeed, fourteen materials had an actionability of 0%. The average usefulness score of the materials was 4.3 points out of a possible 7. There were few suitable audiovisual materials for patient education on diabetes.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings will be useful for developing new audiovisual educational materials for diabetes patients with high understandability, actionability, and usefulness. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing is emerging as a first-line diagnostic method in some clinical disciplines, but its usefulness has yet to be examined for most constitutional disorders in adults, including chronic kidney disease, which affects more than 1 in 10 persons globally.; METHODS: We conducted exome sequencing and diagnostic analysis in two cohorts totaling 3315 patients with chronic kidney disease. We assessed the diagnostic yield and, among the patients for whom detailed clinical data were available, the clinical implications of diagnostic and other medically relevant findings.; RESULTS: In all, 3037 patients (91.6%) were over 21 years of age, and 1179 (35.6%) were of self-identified non-European ancestry. We detected diagnostic variants in 307 of the 3315 patients (9.3%), encompassing 66 different monogenic disorders. Of the disorders detected, 39 (59%) were found in only a single patient. Diagnostic variants were detected across all clinically defined categories, including congenital or cystic renal disease (127 of 531 patients [23.9%]) and nephropathy of unknown origin (48 of 281 patients [17.1%]). Of the 2187 patients assessed, 34 (1.6%) had genetic findings for medically actionable disorders that, although unrelated to their nephropathy, would also lead to subspecialty referral and inform renal management.; CONCLUSIONS: Exome sequencing in a combined cohort of more than 3000 patients with chronic kidney disease yielded a genetic diagnosis in just under 10% of cases.

AB Challenges in obtaining tissue specimens from patients with brain tumours limit the diagnosis and molecular characterisation and impair the development of better therapeutic approaches. The analysis of cell-free tumour DNA in plasma (considered a liquid biopsy) has facilitated the characterisation of extra-cranial tumours. However, cell-free tumour DNA in plasma is limited in quantity and may not reliably capture the landscape of genomic alterations of brain tumours. Here, we review recent work assessing the relevance of cell-free tumour DNA from cerebrospinal fluid in the characterisation of brain cancer. We focus on the advances in the use of the cerebrospinal fluid as a source of cell-free tumour DNA to facilitate diagnosis, reveal actionable genomic alterations, monitor responses to therapy, and capture tumour heterogeneity in patients with primary brain tumours and brain and leptomeningeal metastases. Profiling cerebrospinal fluid cell-free tumour DNA provides the opportunity to precisely acquire and monitor genomic information in real time and guide precision therapies. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based mutation panels profile multiple genes simultaneously, allowing the reporting of numerous genes while saving labor and resources. However, one drawback of using NGS is that the turnaround time is often longer than conventional single gene tests. This delay can be problematic if molecular results are required to guide therapy in patients with clinically aggressive diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel custom platform designated as Ultra-rapid Reporting of GENomic Targets (URGENTseq), an integrated solution that includes workflow optimization and an innovative custom bioinformatics pipeline to provide targeted NGS results on fresh peripheral blood and bone marrow samples within an actionable time period. URGENTseq was validated for clinical use by determining mutant allelic frequency and minimum coverage in silico to achieve 100% concordance for all positive and negative calls between the URGENTseq and conventional sequencing approach. URGENTseq enables the reporting of selected genes useful for immediate diagnosis (CALR, CSF3R, JAK2, KRAS, MPL, NPM1, NRAS, SF3B1) and treatment decisions (IDH1, IDH2) in hematologic malignancies within 48 hours of specimen collection. In addition, we summarize the molecular findings of the first 272 clinical test results performed using the URGENTseq platform.

AB OBJECTIVE: To create a shared vision for the content, delivery, measurement, and sustainment of patient-centered high value care.; METHODS: We performed a scoping review and translated findings into toolkit for system leaders. For our scoping review, we searched Medline, 2005-November 2015, for literature on patient-centered care (PCC) and its relationship to a high value care change model. We supplemented searches with key author, Google Scholar, and key website searches. One author reviewed all titles, abstracts, and articles for inclusion; another reviewed a random 20%. To develop our toolkit, we translated evidence into simple, actionable briefs on key topics and added resources. We then iteratively circulated briefs and the overall toolkit to potential users, making updates as needed.; RESULTS: In our scoping review, we found multiple interventions and measures to support the components of PCC and our change model. We found little on the overall effects of PCC or how PCC creates value. Potential users reported our toolkit was simple, understandable, thorough, timely, and likely to be globally useful.; CONCLUSIONS: Considerable evidence supports patient-centered high value care and a toolkit garnered enthusiasm.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The toolkit is ready for use, but needs comparison to other approaches.

AB The primary focus of public health recommendations related to the prevention of food-related chronic disease has been on the adoption of healthy dietary patterns; however, implementation has been challenging. There has been increasing recognition that an individual's diet and environment may impact disease susceptibility by affecting the expression of genes involved in critical metabolic pathways. Precision nutrition (PN) has emerged to translate discoveries about diversity in nutrient metabolism between subgroups and the inter-individual variability in the responses to dietary interventions. The overarching goals of PN are to deliver individualized, actionable dietary therapy based on an individual's nutritional phenotype, created from the integration of genetics, metabolic profile, and environmental factors in order to prevent and treat chronic disease. This review addresses the developments of genome- and omic-driven PN and how they have been used to prevent and treat disease, as well as how they might be integrated into broader clinical practice.

AB Recent remarkable advances in genome sequencing have enabled detailed maps of identified and interpreted genomic variation, dubbed "mutanomes." The availability of thousands of exome/genome sequencing data has prompted the emergence of new challenges in the identification of novel druggable targets and therapeutic strategies. Typically, mutanomes are viewed as one- or two-dimensional. The three-dimensional protein structural view of personal mutanomes sheds light on the functional consequences of clinically actionable mutations revealed in tumor diagnosis and followed up in personalized treatments, in a mutanome-informed manner. In this review, we describe the protein structural landscape of personal mutanomes and provide expert opinions on rational strategies for more streamlined oncological drug discovery and molecularly targeted therapies for each individual and each tumor. We provide the structural mechanism of orthosteric versus allosteric drugs at the atom-level via targeting specific somatic alterations for combating drug resistance and the "undruggable" challenges in solid and hematologic neoplasias. We discuss computational biophysics strategies for innovative mutanome-informed cancer immunotherapies and combination immunotherapies. Finally, we highlight a personal mutanome infrastructure for the emerging development of personalized cancer medicine using a breast cancer case study.

AB BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of tumor biopsies from patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas yield insufficient tissue for successful molecular subtyping. We have analyzed the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with inadequate tumor samples for tissue genotyping.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted the study in a multi-institutional prospective cohort of clinically unselected patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas with insufficient tissue for EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genotyping across 12 Spanish institutions (n=93). ctDNA NGS was carried out by Guardant Health (Guardant360, Redwood City, CA), using a hybrid-capture-based 73-gene panel. Variants were deemed actionable if they were part of the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge database and classified in four levels of actionability based on their clinical or preclinical evidence for drug response.; RESULTS: Eighty-three out of 93 patients (89%) had detectable levels of ctDNA. Potentially actionable level 1-4 genomic alterations were detected in 53 cases (57%), of which 13 (14%) had level 1-2A alterations (Food and Drug Administration-approved and standard-care biomarkers according to lung cancer guidelines). Frequencies of each genomic alteration in ctDNA were consistent with those observed in unselected pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The majority of the patients (62%), particularly those with actionable alterations (87%), had more than one pathogenic variant in ctDNA. The median turnaround time to genomic results was 13days. Twelve patients (13%) received genotype-matched therapies based on ctDNA results, deriving the expected clinical benefit. Patients with co-occurring pathogenic alterations had a significantly shorter median overall survival as compared with patients without co-occurring pathogenic alteration (multivariate hazard ratio = 5.35, P=0.01).; CONCLUSION: Digital NGS of ctDNA in lung cancers with insufficient tumor samples for tissue sequencing detects actionable variants that frequently co-occur with other potentially clinically relevant genomic alterations, allowing timely initiation of genotype-matched therapies. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors; it is a focus of research globally, but the identification of clinically actionable oncogenic drivers remains elusive. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) activation is present in approximately 5% of CRC and has acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy. Early clinical trials suggest an emerging role for personalized HER2-targeted therapy in a subset of metastatic CRC.; AREAS COVERED: This manuscript reviews the relevance of HER2 activation in CRC and its potential role as a target for therapy. A literature search was conducted in June 2018 of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for published preclinical and clinical studies; abstracts of international cancer meetings (AACR, ASCO, and ESMO) were also reviewed.; EXPERT OPINION: HER2 is activated in a small but relevant proportion of CRC patients (particularly left-side, RAS wild-type, anti-EGFR resistant tumors). Dual HER2 blockade with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) or the combination of mAbs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (trastuzumab and lapatinib) induces durable tumor responses in about one-third of HER2-positive CRC refractory to standard systemic therapy. Although immature, these results are remarkable and anticipate an expanding role for HER2 as a therapeutic target in CRC.

AB BACKGROUND: Many families wish to have radiologic tests performed locally, especially when obtaining these tests in specialized pediatric centers would require long-distance travel with associated costs and inconveniences. The differential availability of specialized and common pediatric uroradiographic tests in rural and urban areas has not been described. We undertook this study to describe the availability of common radiographic tests ordered by pediatric urologists, and to identify disparities in the availability of radiographic tests between urban and rural locations.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed all freestanding hospitals in Washington State on the availability of flat-plate abdominal radiograph (AXR), renal-bladder ultrasounds (RBUS), voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG), MAG-3 renal scans, and nuclear cystograms (NC) for children, as well as testing restrictions, availability of sedation for urology tests, and presence of onsite radiologists. Rural and urban hospitals were compared on these characteristics.; RESULTS: The survey was completed by 74 of 88 institutions (84.1%); 17 (23.0%) were rural (population <2500), 32 (43.2%) were in urban clusters (population 2500-50,000), and 25 (33.8%) were in urban areas (population >50,000). Seventy-three (98.6%) institutions offered AXR, 68 (91.9%) offered RBUS, 44 (59.5%) offered VCUG, 26 (35.1%) offered MAG-3, and 15 (20.3%) offered NC to children. All urban and most (16/17; 94.1%) rural institutions had shareable digital imaging capability. AXR (100% versus 96%, P=0.88) and RBUS (70.6% versus 96%, P=0.15) availability was similar in rural and urban settings, whereas VCUG (11.8% versus 72%, P=0.001), MAG-3 (5.9% versus 60%, P=0.006), and NC (0% versus 44%, P=0.017) were more commonly available in urban settings. Fewer rural hospitals employed full-time, in-house radiologists (35.3% versus 96%, P<0.0001) or offered sedation (6.3% versus 36%, P=0.01) for testing, but an equal proportion had age restrictions on the tests offered (40% versus 17.6%, P=0.50). Fellowship-trained pediatric radiologists (0% versus 16%, P=0.39) and child life specialists (0% versus 20%, P=0.28) worked exclusively in urban settings. Most hospitals offering specialized radiographic tests (VCUG: 90.9%; P<0.0001 and MAG-3: 92.3%; P=0.002) had onsite radiologists.; CONCLUSIONS: The geographically widespread availability of AXR and RBUS may represent an opportunity to offer families care closer to home, realizing cost and time savings. Anxious children and those requiring more specialized studies may benefit from referral to urban centers. The lack of rural radiologists may be an actionable barrier to availability of specialized radiology testing. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB HER2-positive breast cancer is defined by amplification or overexpression of the HER2/ERBB2 oncogene and accounts for about 15% of breast cancer cases. Somatic mutation of ERBB2 is an alternative mechanism, by which activation of HER2 signaling can occur. ERBB2 mutation has been associated with invasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC). This study investigates the frequency and phenotype of ILBC harboring mutated ERBB2. The ERBB2 mutation status was determined by next generation sequencing and/or pyrosequencing in n =106 ILBCs, including n =86 primary or locally recurrent tumors and n =20 metastases from visceral organs, soft tissue, or skin. Immunohistochemical characteristics were determined using tissue microarrays. This series was enriched for ILBCs with pleomorphic histology and/or high-risk expression profiles (Oncotype DX, recurrence score RS>25). Nearly all specimens were E-cadherin-negative (99%), estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (92%), and lacked ERBB2 overexpression (96%). ERBB2 mutations (p.V777L, p.L755S, p.S310F) were identified in 5/106 (5%) cases. ERBB2-mutated cases included 2/86 (2%) primary tumors and 3/20 (15%) metastases (P = 0.045). ERBB2-mutated cases were associated with loss of ER (2/7, 29%, P = 0.035) and histological grade 3 (4/34, 12%, P = 0.023), but not with solid growth (3/31, 10%, P = 0.148) or pleomorphic histology (2/27, 7%, P = 0.599). No ERBB2 mutation was detected in ILBCs with RS>25 (0/22, 0%). In 10 patients with multiple matched specimens (n =25), the ERBB2 mutational status was always concordant. In summary, a small subset of ILBCs harbors potentially actionable ERBB2 mutations. In ERBB2-mutated ILBCs, no association with pleomorphic histology was found. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Interest from Congress, executive branch leadership, and various other stakeholders for greater accountability in government continues to gain momentum today with government-wide efforts. However, measuring the impact of research programs has proven particularly difficult. Cause and effect linkages between research findings and changes to morbidity and mortality are difficult to prove. To address this challenge, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health program evaluators used a modified version of contribution analysis (CA) to evaluate two research programs. CA proved to be a useful framework for assessing research impact, and both programs received valuable, actionable feedback. Although there is room to further refine our approach, this was a promising step toward moving beyond bibiliometrics to more robust assessment of research impact.

AB The Personalized Onco-Genomics (POG) program at BC Cancer integrates whole-genome (DNA) and RNA sequencing into practice for metastatic malignancies. We examined the subgroup of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and report the prevalence of actionable targets, treatments, and outcomes. We identified patients who were enrolled in the POG program between 2012 and 2016 who had a tumor biopsy and blood samples with comprehensive DNA (80*, 40* normal) and RNA sequencing followed by in-depth bioinformatics to identify potential cancer drivers and actionable targets. In NSCLC cases, we compared the progression-free survival (PFS) of "POG-informed therapies" with the PFS of the last regimen prior to POG (PFS ratio). In 29 NSCLC cases, 11 were male (38%), the median age was 60.2 yr (range: 39.4-72.6), and histologies included were adenocarcinoma (93%) and squamous cell carcinoma (7%). Potential molecular targets (i.e., cancer drivers including TP53 mutations) were identified in 26 (90%), and 21 (72%) had actionable targets. Therapies based on standard-of-care mutation analysis, such as EGFR mutations, were not considered POG-informed therapies. Thirteen received POG-informed therapies, of which three had no therapy before POG; therefore a comparator PFS could not be obtained. Of 10 patients with POG-informed therapy, median PFS ratio was 0.94 (IQR 0.2-3.4). Three (30%) had a PFS ratio ≥1.3, and three (30%) had a PFS ratio ≥0.8 and <1.3. In this small cohort of NSCLC, 30% demonstrated longer PFS with POG-informed therapies. Larger studies will help clarify the role of whole-genome analysis in clinical practice. © 2019 Tsang et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively assess the incidence of high beta hydroxybutyrate, low bicarbonate (BIC), high acyl carnitine, low selenium, low magnesium, low zinc, low phosphorus, in a cohort of supplemented patients treated with the ketogenic diet (KD) for medically intractable epilepsy. To analyze effect of age, duration of exposure to KD, type of KD, and route of KD intake on lab abnormalities. To analyze the incidence of clinically actionable results, resulting in medical interventions based on abnormal results and to analyze costs of testing.; METHODS: Retrospective chart review and statistical analysis. Association between abnormal values (binary) and categorical variables was tested with Chi-square/Fisher's exact test. Associations between abnormal values (binary) and continuous variables were analyzed with logistic regression. Statistical analyses were performed in SAS 9.4.; RESULTS: We included 91 patients with average duration on diet of 46.73 months (IQR 18.8-75.5 months). Most patients were on the classic KD (81 KD- 59% on 4:1 ratio, 10 modified Atkins diet). 74% were orally fed and 70% completed lab visits to the 12-month mark. There was no significant association between abnormal laboratory parameters and duration of exposure, type of diet, route of administration. Younger children were more likely to have low BIC, high acyl carnitine. Older children were more likely to have low phosphorus. Less than 15% of patients reported clinical changes to suggest dietary deficiency in vitamins/ minerals and in < 11% of cases was an actionable laboratory parameter found.; SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first to document the real-life incidence of selected tests being abnormal when following consensus guidelines on lab testing. Elimination of tests with low yield will result in cost savings of up to $USD 185 per visit. Low phosphorus is frequently found in patients on KD. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precise tests for genomic structural variation (SV) are essential for accurate diagnosis of prenatal genome abnormalities. The two most ubiquitous traditional methods for prenatal SV assessment, karyotyping and chromosomal microarrays, do not provide sufficient resolution for some clinically actionable SVs. Standard whole-genome sequencing (WGS) overcomes shortcomings of traditional techniques by providing base-pair resolution of the entire accessible genome. However, while sequencing costs have continued to decline in recent years, conventional WGS costs remain high for most routine clinical applications. Here, we describe a specialized WGS technique using large inserts (liWGS; also known as "jumping libraries") to resolve large (>5000-10,000 nucleotides) SVs at kilobase-resolution in prenatal samples, and at a fraction of the cost of standard WGS. We explicate the protocols for generating liWGS libraries and supplement with an overview for processing and analyzing liWGS data.

AB Amniotic fluid, the fetal-protective liquid that fills the amniotic sac, represents a rich source of biomarkers. The diagnostic utility of amniotic fluid relies on the highly abundant maternal and fetal nucleic acid and proteomic content, which allows for the simultaneous determination of mother and fetal health status. Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) that are released by all cells and found in amniotic fluid could be harnessed to provide substantial clinically actionable data. ECVs are mediators of critical biological functions and reflect the health of the parent cell. Thus, ECVs released from cells in distress may provide important diagnostic information. Here, we describe a straightforward and optimized method for isolating ECVs from amniotic fluid. In addition, we validate our procedure through western blotting using antibodies targeting canonical ECV protein markers and via direct visualization using transmission electron microscopy.

AB PURPOSE: We examined associations between caregiving intensity and mental health among cancer caregivers at the population level and potential moderation by an actionable intervention target, support service needs.; METHODS: Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System survey data (2015) from caregivers of adult patients with cancer was analyzed. Caregiving intensity included hours per week caregiving (high, > 20; low, ≤ 20) and caregiving duration (long, > 2 years; short, ≤ 2 years). Mental health was reported as number of mentally unhealthy days (MUDs) in the past 30. Support service needs comprised caregiving classes, service access, support groups, counseling, and respite care. Multivariable linear regression models were performed adjusting for sociodemographics and sampling weights.; RESULTS: A total of 1,831 caregivers were included in the study, representing approximately 1.1 million cancer caregivers in the 18 US states, distributed with the following intensity: 122 (8.3%) caregivers reported care at high hours/long duration, 213 (13.1%) high hours/short duration, 329 (18.4%) low hours/long duration, and 910 (60.2%) low hours/short duration. Mean MUDs was 6 (SE, 0.5). The highest reported unmet service need was help with service access (48.4%). Higher caregiving intensity and support service need were associated with more MUDs ( P < .05), with a significant interaction ( P = .02) between caregiving intensity and unmet support service needs. High hour/long duration caregivers reporting any unmet needs had a mean of 15 versus 8 MUDs for those with no unmet needs.; CONCLUSION: High-intensity cancer caregiving was associated with poor mental health, especially for those reporting support service needs. Developing strategies to optimize support service provision for high-intensity cancer caregivers is warranted.

AB Primary liver cancer (PLC) ranks among the most lethal solid cancers worldwide due to lack of effective biomarkers for early detection and limited treatment options in advanced stages. Development of primary culture models that closely recapitulate phenotypic and molecular diversities of PLC is urgently needed to improve the patient outcome. Long-term cultures of 7 primary liver cancer cell lines of hepatocellular and cholangiocellular origin were established using defined culture conditions. Morphological and histological characteristics of obtained cell lines and xenograft tumors were analyzed and compared to original tumors. Time course analyses of transcriptomic and genomic changes were performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Key oncogenic alterations were identified by targeted NGS and cell lines carrying potentially actionable mutations were treated with corresponding specific inhibitors. PDCL fully resembled morphological features of the primary cancers in vitro and in vivo over extended period in culture. Genomic alterations as well as transcriptome profiles showed high similarity with primary tumors and remained stable during long-term culturing. Targeted-NGS confirmed that key oncogenic mutations such as TP53, KRAS, CTNNB1 as well as actionable mutations (e.g. MET, cKIT, KDR) were highly conserved in PDCL and amenable for individualized therapeutic approaches. Integrative genomic and transcriptomic approaches further demonstrated that PDCL more closely resemble molecular and prognostic features of PLC than established cell lines and are valuable tool for direct target evaluation. Our integrative analysis demonstrates that PDCL represents refined model for discovery of relevant molecular subgroups and exploration of precision medicine approaches for the treatment of this deadly disease. © 2018 UICC.

AB Clients' emotions often serve as a major focus for therapists' attention. Interestingly, little is known about the factors that facilitate or hinder therapists' accurate assessment of these emotions. We hypothesized that therapists' accuracy would be negatively tied to their clients' emotional fluctuation (i.e., instability) and positively tied to the therapists' own inferential fluctuation (i.e., flexibility) as well as to the clients' emotional intensity. Clients (N = 98/N = 76) received weekly psychodynamic psychotherapy at a university-based clinic. Following each session, clients reported their within-session emotions, and therapists provided their own assessment of their clients' emotions. As expected, when clients' emotions were more unstable, therapists were less accurate in tracking these emotions. Additionally, when therapists' assessments of their clients' emotions were more flexible, they were more accurate in tracking them. Our results help identify factors that predict accurate emotion perception within psychotherapy and may translate into actionable ideas for enhancing this accuracy.

AB PURPOSE: The implementation, benefits, and challenges of clinical pharmacist services within a Precision Medicine Program for cancer patients are described. By relating the practice model that was developed, this report may further encourage pharmacists at cancer centers nationally to be involved and lead precision-based care in the oncology setting.; SUMMARY: A clinical pharmacist was integrated into a Precision Medicine Program for oncology patients using somatic testing to identify actionable mutations and apply targeted therapy to malignancies. This pharmacist served as a drug resource for the program's molecular tumor board and oncologists seeking precision-based oncologic strategies. The pharmacist was a facilitator of drug assistance and dispensing in collaboration with the specialty pharmacy and provided care to 14 oncology patients receiving precision-based therapies. The clinical pharmacist was readily accepted as an addition to the team by both oncologists and patients and the experience served as an important learning opportunity.; CONCLUSION: The success of integrating this precision medicine pharmacist into a newly formed Precision Medicine Program and the model it can serve as may be considered for other cancer centers that may or may not have easily accessible pharmacogenomic experts and resources. This service highlights the importance of pharmacist care in such a program and the various opportunities for integration. Oncology clinical pharmacists should seek to integrate into Precision Medicine Programs and systems directing this care and develop their knowledge and understanding of genomics to continue providing the highest level of cancer care as a pivotal member of the cancer care team.

AB Mass spectrometry-based protein quantitation is currently used to measure therapeutically relevant protein biomarkers in CAP/CLIA setting to predict likely responses of known therapies. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is the method of choice due to its outstanding analytical performance. However, data-independent acquisition (DIA) is now emerging as a proteome-scale clinical assay. We evaluated the ability of DIA to profile the patient-specific proteomes of sample-limited tumor biopsies and to quantify proteins of interest in a targeted fashion using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies ( n = 12) selected from our clinical laboratory. DIA analysis on the tumor biopsies provided 3713 quantifiable proteins including actionable biomarkers currently in clinical use, successfully separated two gastric cancers from colorectal cancer specimen solely on the basis of global proteomic profiles, and identified subtype-specific proteins with prognostic or diagnostic value. We demonstrate the potential use of DIA-based quantitation to inform therapeutic decision-making using TUBB3, for which clinical cutoff expression levels have been established by SRM. Comparative analysis of DIA-based proteomic profiles and mRNA expression levels found positively and negatively correlated protein-gene pairs, a finding consistent with previously reported results from fresh-frozen tumor tissues.

AB Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) supports colorectal cancer progression via oncogenic signaling. Anti-EGFR therapy is being investigated as a clinical option for colorectal cancer, and an observed interaction between EGFR and Prion protein has been detected in neuronal cells. We hypothesized that PrPC expression levels may regulate EGFR signaling and that detailed understanding of this signaling pathway may enable identification of resistance mechanisms and new actionable targets in colorectal cancer. We performed molecular pathway analysis following knockdown of PrPC or inhibition of EGFR signaling via gefitinib to identify changes in expression of key signaling proteins that determine cellular sensitivity or resistance to cisplatin. Expression of these proteins was examined in matched primary and metastatic patient samples and was correlated for resistance to therapy and progression of disease. Utilizing three colorectal cancer cell lines, we observed a correlation between high expression of PrPC and resistance to cisplatin. Investigation of molecular signaling in a resistant cell line revealed that PrPC contributed to signaling via colocalization with EGFR, which could be overcome by targeting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK). We revealed that the level of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a target downstream of p38 MAPK, was predictive for cell line and patient response to platinum agents. Further, high KLF5 expression was observed in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Our study indicates that the EGFR to KLF5 pathway is predictive of patient progression on platinum-based therapy. © 2018 The Authors. Published by FEBS Press and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB It is generally accepted that some screen-detected breast cancers are overdiagnosed and would not progress to symptomatic cancer if left untreated. However, precise estimates of the fraction of nonprogressive cancers remain elusive. In recognition of the weaknesses of overdiagnosis estimation methods based on excess incidence, there is a need for model-based approaches that accommodate nonprogressive lesions. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of a generalized model of breast cancer natural history that allows for a mixture of progressive and indolent lesions. We provide a formal proof of global structural identifiability of the model and use simulation to identify conditions that allow for parameter estimates that are sufficiently precise and practically actionable. We show that clinical follow-up after the last screening can play a critical role in ensuring adequately precise identification of the fraction of indolent cancers in a stop-screen trial design, and we demonstrate that model misspecification can lead to substantially biased estimates of mean sojourn time. Finally, we illustrate our findings using the example of Canadian National Breast Screening Study 2 (1980-1985) and show that the fraction of indolent cancers is not precisely identifiable. Our findings provide the foundation for extended models that account for both in situ and invasive lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is behaviorally and biologically heterogeneous and likely represents a series of conditions arising from different underlying genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. There are currently no reliable diagnostic biomarkers for ASD. Based on evidence that dysregulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) may contribute to the behavioral characteristics of ASD, we tested whether dysregulation of amino acids (AAs) was a pervasive phenomenon in individuals with ASD. This is the first article to report results from the Children's Autism Metabolome Project (CAMP), a large-scale effort to define autism biomarkers based on metabolomic analyses of blood samples from young children.; METHODS: Dysregulation of AA metabolism was identified by comparing plasma metabolites from 516 children with ASD with those from 164 age-matched typically developing children recruited into the CAMP. ASD subjects were stratified into subpopulations based on shared metabolic phenotypes associated with BCAA dysregulation.; RESULTS: We identified groups of AAs with positive correlations that were, as a group, negatively correlated with BCAA levels in ASD. Imbalances between these two groups of AAs identified three ASD-associated amino acid dysregulation metabotypes. The combination of glutamine, glycine, and ornithine amino acid dysregulation metabotypes identified a dysregulation in AA/BCAA metabolism that is present in 16.7% of the CAMP subjects with ASD and is detectable with a specificity of 96.3% and a positive predictive value of 93.5% within the ASD subject cohort.; CONCLUSIONS: Identification and utilization of metabotypes of ASD can lead to actionable metabolic tests that support early diagnosis and stratification for targeted therapeutic interventions.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate the different factors affecting the procedure duration for high-dose-rate brachytherapy for gynecologic malignancies.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: We prospectively recorded 86 consecutive vaginal cylinder (VC) treatments and 82 tandem and ovoid treatments. Key time points in the brachytherapy process, identity of the planner and checker, number of treatments per day, and fraction number per patient were recorded. The data were analyzed in a mixed effects linear regression model to account for the within patient correlation. Post hoc pair-wise comparisons were performed using a Dunnett's adjustment for comparisons to a single control group and using a Tukey adjustment for all pair-wise comparisons.; RESULTS: We focused on several key time intervals in the treatment: total, nursing/anesthesia preprocedure, procedure, contouring, and planning times. In analysis, multiple factors significantly influenced VC timing but not tandem and ovoid timing. The planners were separated and analyzed based on experience and profession. Inexperienced physicists planning times were on average 18min (p=0.0010) and 14min (p=0.0038) slower than dedicated brachytherapy dosimetrist and experienced physicists, respectively. An increase in the number of procedures for the day of treatment increased the VC total time (p=0.0218). The VC procedure time changed depending on whether it was the patients' first, second, or third VC treatment (p<0.0001).; CONCLUSIONS: The use of dosimetrists as dedicated planners for brachytherapy is more cost and time efficient. There are multiple variables affecting brachytherapy treatment with actionable opportunities to improve procedure scheduling. Copyright © 2018 American Brachytherapy Society.
