==================
   RADIOLOGY
==================

CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior
widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7
facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.

3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is
further
described above.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further
evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
Recommend emergent repositioning.

CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**])
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate
with CT C- spine performed concurrently.

HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**])
1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from
facial bone CT scan.
4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to
dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail.
5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

CHEST [**2162-3-10**]
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**]
1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp
imaging.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial CT.

RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**])
Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
CT

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**])
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.

[**2162-3-14**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal
in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the
stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.
There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is
DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.
2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with
associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No
associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate
clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.
injections.
3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could
represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.
If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further
evaluation.
4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too
small to accurately characterize.
5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.
6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].

[**2162-3-16**]
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video
fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration
of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the
speech pathologist.

ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue
movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar
elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal
elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is
moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is
residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate
impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both
thin and puree barium.

IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional
information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's
report from the same day.

[**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out:
FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not
as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities
are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia
in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is
unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck
secondary to recent spinal surgery.

IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small
intraventricular hemorrhage.

No discharge labs as patient CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height
of approximatly 10 feet.  CT scans of his chest, abdomen and
pelvis were negative for pathology.  CT scan of his C-spine
showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7.  He
was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.

C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical
procedures to stabilized his c-spine.  [**2162-3-4**]: anterior
cervical decompression/fusion at C6-7.  [**2162-3-5**]: Cervical
laminectomy C6-C7 & T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesis
C4-T1.  He tolerated the procedures well.  He was extubated
without complication.

After his surgical procedures, Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was transfered
to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 18**] for his medical care. While on

and family were not interested in an NG tube or PEG for
nutrition. Patient also developed a venous clot of the right
upper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed with
medical treatment. Goals of care were changed to comfort
measures only. A foley was placed after patient had difficulty
with urinary retention and straight cathing. A palliative care
consult was obtained for symptom management and patient was
discharged to hospice with morphine, olanzapine, and a foley in
place for symptomatic relief.
