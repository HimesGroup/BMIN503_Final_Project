### Overview
This project aims to evaluate blood product transfusion at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.  I will use a dataset from 2021 that includes all transfusions performed, and the patientâ€™s complete blood count, clotting tests, and other parameters. The goal is to assess how often patients received transfusions when they fell outside the established clinical guidelines for blood components.



### Introduction 
Blood product transfusion is a common and lifesaving intervention for patients, but despite its benefits, it also introduces risks for patients, including the risk of transfusion reaction, infectious complications, and alloimmunization. Many studies over the past few decades have demonstrated that transfusion thresholds that are more conservative, i.e. more restrictive, lead to better patient outcomes than liberal transfusion thresholds. I am examining an operational dataset which contains blood products administered to patients, and their hematologic lab values, which will be compared to established transfusion guidelines. 

Obviously, there are many complex factors that play into whether a transfusion is indicated, and transfusion thresholds may be personalized for patients, but it will be helpful to describe practices and trends to identify areas for potential intervention. There are several specific questions of particular interest to the blood bank, notably how often clinicians evaluate the corrected count increment after platelet transfusion.  Other concerns include the size of the population with certain transfusion thresholds, and identifying practice patterns for particular providers. In general, knowing how blood products are used allows the blood bank to more accurately predict blood needs in the future, which allows for better planning and inventory management.


### Methods
For this project, I will utilize data from the Cerner database for the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from 2020-2021. This data is directly from the laboratory information system for lab orders, lab results, and blood product administration. The dataset identifies the patient, the transfusion they received, the timing of the transfusion, as well as the results of relevant hemtologic labs in the time period surrounding the transfusion, including hemoglobin, platelet values, and coagulation values.  This data, being pulled from the electronic medical record, is reliable in that it records all of the described fields that exist accurately. However, it does lack clinical context, Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

Data cleaning:
The data that I have for this project begins in an excel file, which means that I need to do some cleaning to get it in the right format. I will also be using de-identified data, in which MRN is a random ID, and all names and accession numbers have been removed.

R Code:

UnbrokenHgb<- df_Hgb %>%
  filter(between(TRANSFUSION_DATE, as.Date('2021-02-01'), as.Date('2021-05-15')))
```

The next steps of analysis include breaking down the hemoglobin by collection time, and comparing it to the transfusion time to be able to compare pre and post hemoglobin values, as well as average pre transfusion hemoglobin, and post-transfusion hemoglobin.

I would then compare whether the pre-transfusion hemoglobin was greater than the recommended <7 in most hemodynamically stable patients.  We would expect that some percentage of patients would be transfused above this threshold, because they have cardiac ischemia, or are unstable or have trauma, but it would be useful to get a sense of what proportion of patients fall in this category, and a further chart review could be performed on a subset of patients who did NOT meet criteria, as an audit.


### Conclusions
This analysis was consistent with my anecdotal knowledge that the majority of patients received 1-2 transfusions, but that there are extreme outliers who receive 50 or more units.  The overall volume of red blood cell transfusion can very by over a hundred units from one week to the next, but shows less variation from month to month. Given the shelf life of blood, this amount of variation can be planned for.
