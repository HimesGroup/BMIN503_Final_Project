"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Cerebrovascular event/TIA. Streptococcal bacteremia. Evaluate for endocarditis.
Height: (in) 72
Weight (lb): 187
BSA (m2): 2.07 m2
BP (mm Hg): 147/87
HR (bpm): 90
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2158-2-16**] at 13:48
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. No
thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No mass or thrombus in the RA or RAA. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

AORTA: No atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No mass or vegetation on
mitral valve. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the procedure. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No glycopyrrolate was
administered. No TEE related complications.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The Aortic valve is
bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation or mass visualized. Bicuspid aortic valve with trace
aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.
