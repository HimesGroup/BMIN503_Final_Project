"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: 78 year-old man with atrial fibrillation off anticoagulation, please evaluate for thrombus.
Height: (in) 66
Weight (lb): 130
BSA (m2): 1.67 m2
BP (mm Hg): 163/63
HR (bpm): 80
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2173-9-2**] at 09:47
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images not
available) of [**2172-9-30**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No LA mass/thrombus (best excluded by TEE).

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity. Moderate global
LV hypokinesis. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Mild to
moderate ([**12-18**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Mild
PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.
Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best
excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**12-18**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with moderate global
systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2172-9-30**], biventricular systolic function has deteriorated. The other
findings appear similar.
