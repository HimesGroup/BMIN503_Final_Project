Indication: CHF, A-FIB
Height: (in) 66
Weight (lb): 263
BSA (m2): 2.25 m2
BP (mm Hg): 107/81
HR (bpm): 95
Status: Outpatient
Date/Time: [**2191-5-10**] at 15:08
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2190-2-5**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Moderate (2+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Elongated mitral valve
leaflets. Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be
significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Moderate aortic regurgitation. At least mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-2-5**], the findings are
similar.
