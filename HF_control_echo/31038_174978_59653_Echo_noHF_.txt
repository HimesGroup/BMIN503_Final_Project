Indication: Endocarditis.
Height: (in) 74
Weight (lb): 165
BSA (m2): 2.00 m2
BP (mm Hg): 102/72
HR (bpm): 86
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2102-6-14**] at 13:30
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch
coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No masses or
vegetations on aortic valve.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No MVP. No mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. Normal mitral valve supporting structures.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.
Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess seen. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. No pulmonary hypertension or significant
valvular disease seen.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis.
