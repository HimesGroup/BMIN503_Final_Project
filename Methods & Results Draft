### Methods
Draft:
The data that will be used for this final project will come from Philadelphia’s bike share website. This data is publicly available, however there was a system failure and I was unable to access the data. I contacted Allan Wenches, who is the leads the operations of Indego, and he sent me the appropriate data. 

My approach will begin with exploring the data to gain a complete picture of what is provided. I will then create a test and training datasets from what is provided. I will check for any missing values. I will then create histograms and other relevant plots to visually depict distributions of different variables provided in the dataset. I’ll then do hypothesis testing using multivariate analysis. Using the library ‘rpart’ I’ll make a decision tree algorithm, from which I’ll predict the bike demand. 


### Results
Draft:
Results will include histograms to visualize numeric variables given in dataset, boxplots to show differences between categorical variables, a decision tree used to model the prediction. The conclusion will include prediction on the bike demand in different areas. This information can help determine where new bike stations should be built throughout Philadelphia.
