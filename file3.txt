AB BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing has identified actionable genetic aberrations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iCCA), including the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions. Derazantinib (ARQ 087), an orally bioavailable, multi-kinase inhibitor with potent pan-FGFR activity, has shown preliminary therapeutic activity against FGFR2 fusion-positive iCCA.; METHODS: This multicentre, phase 1/2, open-label study enrolled adult patients with unresectable iCCA with FGFR2 fusion, who progressed, were intolerant or not eligible to first-line chemotherapy (NCT01752920). Subjects received derazantinib in continuous daily doses. Tumour response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 every 8 weeks.; RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (18 women/11 men; median age, 58.7 years), 2 treatment-naive and 27 who progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy, were enrolled. Overall response rate was 20.7%, disease control rate was 82.8%. Estimated median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.04-9.2 months). Treatment-related adverse events (AE) were observed in 27 patients (93.1%, all grades), including asthenia/fatigue (69.0%), eye toxicity (41.4%), and hyperphosphatemia (75.9%). Grade≥3 AEs occurred in 8 patients (27.6%).; CONCLUSION: Derazantinib demonstrated encouraging anti-tumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced, unresectable iCCA with FGFR2 fusion who progressed after chemotherapy. A pivotal trial of derazantinib in iCCA is ongoing (NCT03230318).

AB BACKGROUND: Although rare in the United States, gallbladder cancer (GBCA) is a common cause of cancer death in some parts of the world. To investigate regional differences in pathogenesis and outcomes for GBCA, tumor mutations were analyzed from a sampling of specimens.; METHODS: Primary tumors from patients with GBCA who were treated in Chile, Japan, and the United States between 1999 and 2016 underwent targeted sequencing of known cancer-associated genes. Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed differences in clinicopathologic and genetic factors. Kaplan-Meier methods evaluated differences in overall survival from the time of surgery between mutations.; RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were included. Japanese patients (11 patients) were older (median age, 72 years [range, 54-81 years]) compared with patients from Chile (21 patients; median age, 59 years [range, 32-73 years]) and the United States (49 patients; median age, 66 years [range, 46-87 years]) (P=.002) and had more well-differentiated tumors (46% vs 0% for Chile/United States; P<.001) and fewer gallstone-associated cancers (36% vs 67% for Chile and 69% for the United States; P=.13). Japanese patients had a median mutation burden of 6 (range, 1-23) compared with Chile (median mutation burden, 7 [range, 3-20]) and the United States (median mutation burden, 4 [range, 0-27]) (P=.006). Tumors from Japanese patients lacked AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations, whereas Chilean tumors lacked Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) and AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) mutations. SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) was found to be mutated similarly across centers (38% in Chile, 36% in Japan, and 27% in the United States; P=.68) and was univariately associated with worse overall survival (median, 10 months vs 25 months; P=.039). At least one potentially actionable gene was found to be altered in 80% of tumors.; CONCLUSIONS: Differences in clinicopathologic variables suggest the possibility of distinct GBCA pathogenesis in Japanese patients, which may be supported by differences in mutation pattern. Among all centers, SMAD4 mutations were detected in approximately one-third of patients and may represent a converging factor associated with worse survival. The majority of patients carried mutations in actionable gene targets, which may inform the design of future trials. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

AB Despite being one of the most common cancers, treatment options for prostate cancer are limited. Novel approaches for advanced disease are needed. We evaluated the relative rate of use of clinical-grade next generation sequencing (NGS) in prostate cancer, as well as genomic alterations identified and their potential actionability. Of 4864 patients from multiple institutions for whom NGS was ordered by physicians, only 67 (1.4%) had prostate cancer, representing 1/10 the ordering rate for lung cancer. Prostate cancers harbored 148 unique alterations affecting 63 distinct genes. No two patients had an identical molecular portfolio. The median number of characterized genomic alterations per patient was 3 (range, 1 to 9). Fifty-six of 67 patients (84%) had ≥1 potentially actionable alteration. TMPRSS2 fusions affected 28.4% of patients. Genomic aberrations were most frequently detected in TP53 (55.2% of patients), PTEN (29.9%), MYC (17.9%), PIK3CA (13.4%), APC (9.0%), BRCA2 (9.0%), CCND1 (9.0%), and RB1 genes (9.0%). The PI3K (52.2% of patients), WNT (13.5%), DNA repair (17.9%), cell cycle (19.4%), and MAPK (14.9%) machinery were commonly impacted. A minority of patients harbored BRAF, NTRK, ERBB2, or mismatch repair gene abnormalities, which are highly druggable in some cancers. Only ~10% of prostate cancer trials (clinicaltrials.gov, year 2017) applied a (non-hormone) biomarker before intervention. In conclusion, though use of clinical-grade NGS is relatively low and only a minority of trials deploy DNA-based biomarkers, many prostate cancer-associated molecular alterations may be pharmacologically tractable with genomcially targeted therapy or, in the case of mismatch repair anomalies, with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.

AB Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers and is almost always linked to inactivating RB1 and TP53 mutations. SCLC frequently responds, albeit briefly, to chemotherapy. The canonical function of the RB1 gene product RB1 is to repress the E2F transcription factor family. RB1 also plays both E2F-dependent and E2F-independent mitotic roles. We performed a synthetic lethal CRISPR/Cas9 screen in an RB1 -/- SCLC cell line that conditionally expresses RB1 to identify dependencies that are caused by RB1 loss and discovered that RB1 -/- SCLC cell lines are hyperdependent on multiple proteins linked to chromosomal segregation, including Aurora B kinase. Moreover, we show that an Aurora B kinase inhibitor is efficacious in multiple preclinical SCLC models at concentrations that are well tolerated in mice. These results suggest that RB1 loss is a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to Aurora B kinase inhibitors in SCLC and perhaps other RB1 -/- cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: SCLC is rarely associated with actionable protooncogene mutations. We did a CRISPR/Cas9-based screen that showed that RB1 -/- SCLC are hyperdependent on AURKB, likely because both genes control mitotic fidelity, and confirmed that Aurora B kinase inhibitors are efficacious against RB1 -/- SCLC tumors in mice at nontoxic doses.See related commentary by Dick and Li, p. 169.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 151. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States (U.S.). Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) represents 22.6% of all lung cancers nationally, and 26.4% in Appalachian Kentucky (AppKY), where death from lung cancer is exceptionally high. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) characterized genetic alterations in lung SQCC, but this cohort did not focus on AppKY residents.; METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumor and normal DNA samples from 51 lung SQCC subjects from AppKY. Somatic genomic alterations were compared between the AppKY and TCGA SQCC cohorts.; RESULTS: From this AppKY cohort, we identified an average of 237 nonsilent mutations per patient and, in comparison with TCGA, we found that PCMTD1 (18%) and IDH1 (12%) were more commonly altered in AppKY versus TCGA. Using IDH1 as a starting point, we identified a mutually exclusive mutational pattern (IDH1, KDM6A, KDM4E, JMJD1C) involving functionally related genes. We also found actionable mutations (10%) and/or intermediate or high-tumor mutation burden (65%), indicating potential therapeutic targets in 65% of subjects.; CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified an increased percentage of IDH1 and PCMTD1 mutations in SQCC arising in the AppKY residents versus TCGA, with population-specific implications for the personalized treatment of this disease.; IMPACT: Our study is the first report to characterize genomic alterations in lung SQCC from AppKY. These findings suggest population differences in the genetics of lung SQCC between AppKY and U.S. populations, highlighting the importance of the relevant population when developing personalized treatment approaches for this disease. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB People are increasingly able to access their laboratory results via patient portals. The potential benefits provided by such access, such as reductions in patient burden and improvements in patient satisfaction, disease management, and medical decision making, also come with potentially valid concerns about such results causing confusion or anxiety among patients. However, it is possible to clearly convey the meaning of results and, when needed, indicate required action by designing systems to present laboratory results adapted to the people who will use them. Systems should support people in converting the potentially meaningless data of results into meaningful information and actionable knowledge. We offer 10 recommendations toward this goal: (1) whenever possible, provide a clear takeaway message for each result. (2) Signal whether differences are meaningful or not. (3) When feasible, provide thresholds for concern and action. (4) Individualize the frame of reference by allowing custom reference ranges. (5) Ensure the system is accessible. (6) Provide conversion tools along with results. (7) Design in collaboration with users. (8) Design for both new and experienced users. (9) Make it easy for people use the data as they wish. (10) Collaborate with experts from relevant fields. Using these 10 methods and strategies renders access to laboratory results into meaningful and actionable communication. In this way, laboratories and medical systems can support patients and families in understanding and using their laboratory results to manage their health.

AB Individuals receiving in-center maintenance hemodialysis bear a high burden of both physical and mood symptoms. More than half of patients on hemodialysis report sleep disturbance, muscle cramps, and fatigue. Patients describe symptoms as having a deleterious effect on their quality of life, suggesting that symptom alleviation may meaningfully improve patient-reported outcomes. Moreover, patients on hemodialysis have identified symptom management as a key area for research and innovation, prioritizing symptom alleviation over other health outcomes such as mortality and biochemical indices. Despite the importance of symptoms to patients, there has been little research explicitly geared toward improving patient symptoms, and therefore minimal innovation in symptom management. In general, the physiologic underpinnings of symptoms are poorly understood, hampering the development of targeted therapies. In fact, there have been few drugs or devices approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the indication of improving any patient-reported outcomes for patients on hemodialysis. Recognizing this gap in innovation, the Kidney Health Initiative, a public-private partnership between the American Society of Nephrology and US Food and Drug Administration, convened a workgroup to first prioritize symptoms for the development of therapeutic interventions, and then identify near-term actionable research goals for the prioritized physical symptoms of insomnia, muscle cramps, and fatigue. This paper summarizes the pathophysiology of the three prioritized symptoms, identifies key knowledge gaps, acknowledges factors that challenge development of new therapies, and offers the nephrology community actionable research goals for insomnia, muscle cramps, and fatigue.

AB The organ shortage is one of the major challenges in the field of organ transplantation, yet the percentage of kidneys procured and discarded prior to transplantation has continued to rise to twenty percent. The causes of organ discard are complex, yet an urgent need exists for collaborative efforts to maximize the utilization of all potentially transplantable renal allografts. The National Kidney Foundation convened a meeting of experts to identify factors contributing to reduced organ utilization, and to propose actionable solutions to decrease the rate of kidney discards. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB The genetic resources of aquatic biomedical model organisms are the products of millions of years of evolution, decades of scientific development, and hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding investment. Genetic resources (e.g., specific alleles, transgenes, or combinations) of each model organism can be considered a form of scientific wealth that can be accumulated and exchanged, typically in the form of live animals or germplasm. Large-scale maintenance of live aquatic organisms that carry these genetic resources is inefficient, costly, and risky. In situ maintenance may be substantially enhanced and backed up by combining cryopreserved germplasm repositories and genetic information systems with live animal culture. Unfortunately, cryopreservation has not advanced much beyond the status of an exploratory research for most aquatic species, lacks widespread application, and methods for successful cryopreservation remain poorly defined. For most aquatic species biological materials other than sperm or somatic cells are not comprehensively banked to represent and preserve a broad range of genetic diversity for each species. Therefore, new approaches and standardization are needed for repository-level application to ensure reproducible recovery of cryopreserved materials. Additionally, development of new technologies is needed to address preservation of novel biological materials, such as eggs and embryos of aquatic species. To address these goals, the Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted the Cryopreservation of Aquatic Biomedical Models Workshop on January 7 to 8, 2017, in conjunction with the 8th Aquatic Animal Models of Human Disease Conference in Birmingham, Alabama. The goals of the workshop were to assess the status of germplasm cryopreservation in various biomedical aquatic models and allow representatives of the scientific community to develop and prioritize a consensus of specific actionable recommendations that will move the field of cryopreservation of aquatic resources forward. This workshop included sessions devoted to new approaches for cryopreservation of aquatic species, discussion of current efforts and approaches in preservation of aquatic model germplasm, consideration of needs for standardization of methods to support reproducibility, and enhancement of repository development by establishment of scalable high-throughput technologies. The following three broad recommendations were forwarded from workshop attendees: 1: Establish a comprehensive, centralized unit ("hub") to programmatically develop training for and documentation of cryopreservation methods for aquatic model systems. This would include development of species-specific protocols and approaches, outreach programs, community development and standardization, freezing services and training of the next generation of experts in aquatic cryopreservation. 2: Provide mechanisms to support innovative technical advancements that will increase the reliability, reproducibility, simplicity, throughput, and efficiency of the cryopreservation process, including vitrification and pipelines for sperm, oocytes, eggs, embryos, larvae, stem cells, and somatic cells of all aquatic species. This recommendation encompasses basic cryopreservation knowledge and engineering technology, such as microfluidics and automated processing technologies. 3: Implement mechanisms that allow the various aquatic model stock centers to increase their planning, personnel, ability to secure genetic resources and to promote interaction within an integrated, comprehensive repository network for aquatic model species repositories.

AB An international panel of experts representing 17 European countries and Israel convened to discuss current needs and future developments in BRCA testing and counselling and to issue consensus recommendations. The experts agreed that, with the increasing availability of high-throughput testing platforms and the registration of poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase inhibitors, the need for genetic counselling and testing will rapidly increase in the near future. Consequently, the already existing shortage of genetic counsellors is expected to worsen and to compromise the quality of care particularly in individuals and families with suspected or proven hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. Increasing educational efforts within the breast cancer caregiver community may alleviate this limitation by enabling all involved specialities to perform genetic counselling. In the therapeutic setting, for patients with a clinical suspicion of genetic susceptibility and if the results may have an immediate impact on the therapeutic strategy, the majority voted that BRCA1/2 testing should be performed after histological diagnosis of breast cancer, regardless of oestrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Experts also agreed that, in the predictive and therapeutic setting, genetic testing should be limited to individuals with a personal or family history suggestive of a BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant and should also include high-risk actionable genes beyond BRCA1/2. Of high-risk actionable genes, all pathological variants (i.e. class IV and V) should be reported; class III variants of unknown significance, should be reported provided that the current lack of clinical utility of the variant is expressly stated. Genetic counselling should always address the possibility that already tested individuals might be re-contacted in case new information on a particular variant results in a re-classification.

AB Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex autoimmune connective tissue disease combining inflammatory, vasculopathic and fibrotic manifestations. Skin features, which give their name to the disease and are considered as diagnostic as well as prognostic markers, have not been thoroughly investigated in terms of therapeutic targets. CCN proteins (CYR61/CCN1, CTGF/CCN2, NOV/CCN3 and WISP1-2-3 as CCN4-5-6) are a family of secreted matricellular proteins implicated in major cellular processes such as cell growth, migration, differentiation. They have already been implicated in key pathophysiological processes of SSc, namely fibrosis, vasculopathy and inflammation. In this review, we discuss the possible implication of CCN proteins in SSc pathogenesis, with a special focus on skin features, and identify the potential actionable CCN targets. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB PURPOSE: The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics supports parents' opting in or out of secondary analysis of 59 genes when their child has clinical exome/genome sequencing. We explored the reasons adolescents choose to learn certain types of results and the reasons they want to involve or not involve parents in decision-making.; METHODS: Adolescents recruited without clinical indication were offered independent, followed by joint choices with a parent to learn genomic results. After making independent choices, adolescent/parent dyads were interviewed to explore the reasons for their choices. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. The constant comparative method was used to analyze 64 purposefully selected transcripts that included 31 from adolescents who excluded some or all potential results.; RESULTS: Three major themes informed adolescents' choices: (1) actionability of information, (2) knowledge seeking, and (3) psychological impact. Of adolescents who independently excluded some conditions (n=31), 58% changed their initial choices during the joint interview due to parental influence or improved understanding. Nearly all adolescents (98%) wanted to be involved in the decision-making process, and 53% wanted to make choices independently.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute empirical evidence to support the refinement of professional guidelines for adolescents' engagement and preferences in genetic testing decisions.

AB PURPOSE: Precision health initiatives and reduced sequencing costs are driving large-scale human genome analyses. Genetic variant curation is a bottleneck in clinical applications. The burden of variant curation can be high for newly discovered variants because they are less likely to have undergone previous clinical annotation; the rate of discovery of genetic variants in large clinical populations has not been empirically determined.; METHODS: We determined the rate of accrual of unique sequence variants in 90,000 exome sequences. Separate analyses were done for 17,267 autosomal genes and a subset of 74 actionable genes; the effect of relatedness in the cohort was also determined.; RESULTS: Variant discovery showed a nonlinear growth pattern. The rate of unique variant accrual decreased as the database size increased; by 90,000 exomes 97% of all projected coding and splicing variants had been observed. Variants in 74 actionable genes showed a similar pattern. Family relatedness slightly reduced the rate of discovery of unique variants.; CONCLUSION: The heaviest burden of interpretation for genetic variants occurs early and diminishes as the database size increases. Our data provide a framework for scaling pathogenic genetic variant discovery and curation, a critical element of patient care in the era of precision health.

AB PURPOSE: While there has been a recent increase in scholarship around developing policies for the return of results from genetic sequencing, it is not clear whether these approaches are appropriate for genetic epidemiology studies. Because genetic epidemiological research increasingly utilizes genome sequencing methods, particularly in large data sets where researchers did not directly ascertain the subjects, it is important to understand researchers' perspectives on the return of results.; METHODS: We conducted an online survey of members of the International Genetic Epidemiology Society to document the diversity of experiences and impressions regarding return of results. The survey contained both closed and open-ended questions.; RESULTS: Among our respondents who enroll their own research participants, only 21% return secondary findings. Most respondents do not search their sequence data for clinically actionable findings not associated with their disease of interest. Many feel that genetic epidemiologists have a unique perspective on the return of results and that research studies should not follow the same procedures as clinical sequencing studies.; CONCLUSION: Precision medicine initiatives that rely on both clinical and "big data" genomic research should account for variation in researcher perspectives and study design limitations when developing policies and standard practices regarding the return of results.

AB Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy. Surgical resection is curative for local lesions, while effective therapies are lacking for recurrent or metastatic PCs. To study whether targeted therapies could be applied in recurrent or metastatic PCs, potential therapeutic targets were identified with next-generation sequencing (NGS). DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from 19 recurrent or metastatic PC samples. A panel of 560 genes was sequenced with NGS to identify genomic alterations at an average sequencing depth of 581*. In total, 190 genomic alterations were identified. Nine PC samples (47%) harbored at least one potentially actionable genomic alteration including in the after genes: ROS1 (5/19; 26%), PTEN (3/19; 16%), TSC1 (2/19; 11%), PIK3CA (1/19; 5%), AKT1 (1/19; 5%), MTOR (1/19; 5%), ERBB2 (1/19; 5%), NTRK1 (1/19; 5%), IDH1 (1/19; 5%) and FGFR3 (1/19; 5%). CDC73 mutations were detected in 9/19 (47%) PC samples. Additional recurrent genomic alterations were identified in MSH2 (15/19; 79%), AR (9/19; 47%), BCR (8/19; 42%), SLC45A3 (6/19; 32%), MAGI1 (5/19; 26%), ZNF521 (4/19; 21%), KMT2C (4/19; 21%) and NOTCH4 (4/19; 21%). Our study identified a relatively high frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in PC patients in a Chinese population for the first time. A series of recurrent mutant genes was detected as well. Our study contributes to both the selection of novel targeted therapies for PC and further molecular understanding of this refractory malignancy. © 2018 UICC.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to inform public policy opportunities to reduce childhood obesity by identifying parents' perceptions of factors contributing to childhood obesity, attribution of responsibility, and the extent of their support for public prevention policies with attention to socio-economic status.; DESIGN AND METHODS: In 2015, 2066 parent-child dyads across socio-economic strata from 43 randomly selected schools in Ankara completed surveys and measurements to examine perceptions, attribution, and prevention policies related to childhood obesity.; RESULTS: Parents across the socio-demographic spectrum recognized obesity as a serious problem. Unhealthy food availability was identified as the leading cause of while industry and media were credited with having the greatest responsibility for childhood obesity. There was strong public support for policy strategies targeting schools, marketing, and the built environment, though support tempered as socio-economic status and parental education decreased.; CONCLUSIONS: This survey provided insight into parents' knowledge and beliefs surrounding childhood obesity as well as their endorsement of related prevention strategies. Educational messages that address variations in SES to describe the causes of childhood obesity and connect those causes to actionable community prevention strategies may improve community support for enhanced policy actions within and beyond school settings.

AB Melanoma is one of the most highly mutated cancer types. To identify functional drivers of melanoma, we searched for cross-species conserved mutations utilizing a mouse melanoma model driven by loss of PTEN and CDKN2A, and identified mutations in Kras, Erbb3, and Ptpn11. PTPN11 encodes the SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway. Although PTPN11 is an oncogene in leukemia, lung, and breast cancers, its roles in melanoma are not clear. In this study, we found that PTPN11 is frequently activated in human melanoma specimens and cell lines and is required for full RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling activation in BRAF wild-type (either NRAS mutant or wild-type) melanoma cells. PTPN11 played oncogenic roles in melanoma by driving anchorage-independent colony formation and tumor growth. In Pten- and Cdkn2a-null mice, tet-inducible and melanocyte-specific PTPN11E76K expression significantly enhanced melanoma tumorigenesis. Melanoma cells derived from this mouse model showed doxycycline-dependent tumor growth in nude mice. Silencing PTPN11E76K expression by doxycycline withdrawal caused regression of established tumors by induction of apoptosis and senescence, and suppression of proliferation. Moreover, the PTPN11 inhibitor (SHP099) also caused regression of NRASQ61K -mutant melanoma. Using a quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics approach, we identified GSK3alpha/beta as one of the key substrates that were differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated in these experiments modulating PTPN11. This study demonstrates that PTPN11 plays oncogenic roles in melanoma and regulates RAS and GSK3beta signaling pathways. IMPLICATIONS: This study identifies PTPN11 as an oncogenic driver and a novel and actionable therapeutic target for BRAF wild-type melanoma. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Kinase inhibitors form the largest class of precision medicine. From 2013 to 2017, 17 have been approved, with 8 different mechanisms. We present a comprehensive profiling study of all 17 inhibitors on a biochemical assay panel of 280 kinases and proliferation assays of 108 cancer cell lines. Drug responses of the cell lines were related to the presence of frequently recurring point mutations, insertions, deletions, and amplifications in 15 well-known oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. In addition, drug responses were correlated with basal gene expression levels with a focus on 383 clinically actionable genes. Cell lines harboring actionable mutations defined in the FDA labels, such as mutant BRAF(V600E) for cobimetinib, or ALK gene translocation for ALK inhibitors, are generally 10 times more sensitive compared with wild-type cell lines. This sensitivity window is more narrow for markers that failed to meet endpoints in clinical trials, for instance CDKN2A loss for CDK4/6 inhibitors (2.7-fold) and KRAS mutation for cobimetinib (2.3-fold). Our data underscore the rationale of a number of recently opened clinical trials, such as ibrutinib in ERBB2- or ERBB4-expressing cancers. We propose and validate new response biomarkers, such as mutation in FBXW7 or SMAD4 for EGFR and HER2 inhibitors, ETV4 and ETV5 expression for MEK inhibitors, and JAK3 expression for ALK inhibitors. Potentially, these new markers could be combined to improve response rates. This comprehensive overview of biochemical and cellular selectivities of approved kinase inhibitor drugs provides a rich resource for drug repurposing, basket trial design, and basic cancer research. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to identify all freely available online diabetes risk calculators and to evaluate their suitability for patients with low health literacy.; METHODS: Online diabetes risk calculators were identified by an environmental scan. The Patient Education Material Assessment Tool for Printable Materials was used to determine understandability and actionability scores. A high-risk profile was used to compare the risk results obtained with each calculator.; RESULTS: Thirty-five risk calculators were identified; 51% had no described model, 23% reported absolute risk and 31% used visual aids. The estimated risk for the same profile ranged from low to very high. The mean understandability score was 79% (SD=19%) and the mean actionability score was 42% (SD=30%).; CONCLUSIONS: Online diabetes risk calculators are generally understandable, but not very actionable, and may not be completely suitable for use by patients with low health literacy. The estimated risk is highly variable depending on the underlying model used for the calculation.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients and healthcare providers need to exercise caution when selecting a diabetes risk calculator.

AB OBJECTIVE: The differential diagnoses of patients presenting with chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SOB) are broad and non-specific. We aimed to 1) determine how use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) impacted emergency physicians' differential diagnosis, and 2) evaluate the accuracy of POCUS when compared to chest radiograph (CXR) and composite final diagnosis.; METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study in a convenience sample of patients presenting with CP and SOB to the Emergency Department (ED). Treating physicians selected possible diagnoses from a pre-indexed list of possible diagnoses of causes of CP and SOB. The final composite diagnosis from a chart review was determined as the reference standard for the diagnosis. The primary analysis involved calculations of sensitivity and specificity for POCUS identifiable diagnoses in detecting cause of CP and SOB. Additional comparative accuracy analysis with CXRs were conducted.; RESULTS: 128 patients with a mean age of 64 ± 17 years were included in the study. Using a reference standard of composite final diagnoses, POCUS had equal or higher specificity to CXR for all indications for which it was used, except for pneumonia. POCUS correctly identified all patients with pneumothorax, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, CXR never provided any actionable clinical information. Adding POCUS to the initial evaluation causes a significant narrowing of the differential diagnoses in which the median differential diagnosis from 5 (IQR 3-6) to 3 (IQR 2-4) p < 0.001.; CONCLUSION: In evaluation of patients with CP and SOB, POCUS is a highly feasible diagnostic test which can assist in narrowing down the differential diagnoses. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, the added value of a CXR may be minimal. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Healthcare is approaching a tipping point as burnout and dissatisfaction with work-life integration (WLI) in healthcare workers continue to increase. A scale evaluating common behaviours as actionable examples of WLI was introduced to measure work-life balance.; OBJECTIVES: (1) Explore differences in WLI behaviours by role, specialty and other respondent demographics in a large healthcare system. (2) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the work-life climate scale, and the extent to which it acts like a climate, or group-level norm when used at the work setting level. (3) Explore associations between work-life climate and other healthcare climates including teamwork, safety and burnout.; METHODS: Cross-sectional survey study completed in 2016 of US healthcare workers within a large academic healthcare system.; RESULTS: 10627 of 13040 eligible healthcare workers across 440 work settings within seven entities of a large healthcare system (81% response rate) completed the routine safety culture survey. The overall work-life climate scale internal consistency was alpha=0.830. WLI varied significantly among healthcare worker role, length of time in specialty and work setting. Random effects analyses of variance for the work-life climate scale revealed significant between-work setting and within-work setting variance and intraclass correlations reflected clustering at the work setting level. T-tests of top versus bottom WLI quartile work settings revealed that positive work-life climate was associated with better teamwork and safety climates, as well as lower personal burnout and burnout climate (p<0.001).; CONCLUSION: Problems with WLI are common in healthcare workers and differ significantly based on position and time in specialty. Although typically thought of as an individual difference variable, WLI appears to operate as a climate, and is consistently associated with better safety culture norms. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB PURPOSE: Expanded carrier screening (ECS) informs couples of their risk of having offspring affected by certain genetic conditions. Limited data exists assessing the actions and reproductive outcomes of at-risk couples (ARCs). We describe the impact of ECS on planned and actual pregnancy management in the largest sample of ARCs studied to date.; METHODS: Couples who elected ECS and were found to be at high risk of having a pregnancy affected by at least one of 176 genetic conditions were invited to complete a survey about their actions and pregnancy management.; RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one ARCs completed the survey. Among those screened before becoming pregnant, 77% planned or pursued actions to avoid having affected offspring. Among those screened during pregnancy, 37% elected prenatal diagnostic testing (PNDx) for that pregnancy. In subsequent pregnancies that occurred in both the preconception and prenatal screening groups, PNDx was pursued in 29%. The decision to decline PNDx was most frequently based on the fear of procedure-related miscarriage, as well as the belief that termination would not be pursued in the event of a positive diagnosis.; CONCLUSION: ECS results impacted couples' reproductive decision-making and led to altered pregnancy management that effectively eliminates the risk of having affected offspring.

AB BACKGROUND: Medical student reflection is integral for professional development. Preliminary findings suggest that short-format writing promotes reflection and identifies impactful experiences. We sought to determine whether reflective writing could be used as a clerkship needs assessment.; METHODS: During their surgical clerkship, medical students submitted "tweet"-format reflections and completed a standardized evaluation. "Tweet" content was analyzed using modified grounded theory methods and coded by valence, content, and reflection. Sub-coding was conducted to compare feedback between "tweets" and evaluations.; RESULTS: We analyzed 286 reflections and 214 evaluation comments; 176 "tweets" were reflective (62%). "Tweets" commented on "patient interaction" (53%), "educational experience" (38%), "physician interaction" (26%), and "career decisions" (10%). A significant difference was observed between "tweets" and evaluations with regard to the number that provided feedback on experiences with "critically ill or dying patients."; CONCLUSIONS: Reflections provided real-time reactions to impactful clerkship events, notably those involving critically ill or dying patients. This focus on illness may represent an unmet need for discussions related to end of life care. Overall, reflections provided more actionable feedback compared to evaluations.

AB Clinical genomic sequencing can identify pathogenic variants unrelated to the initial clinical question, but of medical relevance to the patients and their families. With ongoing discussions on the utility of disclosing or searching for such variants, it is of crucial importance to obtain unbiased insight in the prevalence of these incidental or secondary findings, in order to better weigh potential risks and benefits. Previous studies have reported a broad range of secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here, we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59 ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization.

AB PURPOSE: Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects up to 1% of live births. However, a genetic diagnosis is not made in most cases. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of genome sequencing (GS) of a heterogeneous cohort of CHD patients.; METHODS: Ninety-seven families with probands born with CHD requiring surgical correction were recruited for genome sequencing. At minimum, a proband-parents trio was sequenced per family. GS data were analyzed via a two-tiered method: application of a high-confidence gene screen (hcCHD), and comprehensive analysis. Identified variants were assessed for pathogenicity using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines.; RESULTS: Clinically relevant genetic variants in known and emerging CHD genes were identified. The hcCHD screen identified a clinically actionable variant in 22% of families. Subsequent comprehensive analysis identified a clinically actionable variant in an additional 9% of families in genes with recent disease associations. Overall, this two-tiered approach provided a clinically relevant variant for 31% of families.; CONCLUSIONS: Interrogating GS data using our two-tiered method allowed identification of variants with high clinical utility in a third of our heterogeneous cohort. However, association of emerging genes with CHD etiology, and development of novel technologies for variant assessment and interpretation, will increase diagnostic yield during future reassessment of our GS data.

AB BACKGROUND: Children presenting to the emergency department with acute psychosis or hallucinations sometimes undergo a head CT to evaluate for a causative lesion. The diagnostic yield of head CT in this scenario has not been reported.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the yield for head CT in children with acute psychosis or hallucinations.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively searched the radiology report database over a 7.5-year period for head CT reports for pediatric emergency department patients using the following keywords: hallucination, psychosis, psychotic or "hearing voices." All reports were categorized as normal or abnormal, and we reviewed and categorized the abnormal cases. We calculated the 95% confidence interval for abnormal CTs using the method of Clopper and Pearson.; RESULTS: We identified 397 pediatric emergency department head CTs. We excluded one non-diagnostic exam. We excluded 34 additional cases (which were all normal) because of clinical indications that might have independently triggered a head CT. Of the remaining 362 cases, 12 reports described abnormalities or variants and we reviewed them individually. Based on consensus review, four were normal, four had congenital malformations, three had encephalomalacia versus demyelination and one demonstrated cortical atrophy. There were no cases with actionable findings such as mass, hemorrhage, infection or hydrocephalus. The 95% confidence interval for a CT demonstrating causative findings was calculated at 0-0.82%.; CONCLUSION: In the absence of concerning factors such as focal neurological deficits, evidence of central nervous system infection, trauma or headache, routine screening head CT might not be warranted in children presenting with acute psychosis or hallucinations.

AB Urachal carcinoma (UrC) is an exceedingly rare neoplasm that develops from the urachus, an embryologic remnant of the urogenital sinus and allantois. The most commonly encountered histologic subtype is adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study is to characterize a series of UrC by morphology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular analysis. We retrospectively investigated seven cases of UrCs and assessed patient symptoms, imaging, histologic features, immunohistochemical profile, molecular characteristics, pathologic stages, and type of treatment. Immunostaining for CK7, CK20, Muc-2, CDX2, GATA3, beta-catenin, and CK34betaE12 was carried out on each neoplasm and on seven non-neoplastic urachal remnants as the control group. Additionally, a mutational analysis was performed using the QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel Kit, which analyzes KRAS, NRAS, KIT, BRAF, PDGFRA, ALK, EGFR, ERBB2, PIK3CA, ERBB3, ESR1, and RAF1. Our cohort comprised five females and two males with a mean age of 64years. UrCs consisted of two mucinous cystadenocarcinomas and five invasive, non-cystic adenocarcinomas. Carcinoma antigen expression profile was positive for CK20 and negative for CK34betaE12 and GATA3 in all cases. Five of seven cases stained positively for Muc-2 and CDX2. On the contrary, non-neoplastic urachal remnants were immunoreactive for CK34betaE12, CK7, and GATA3. Mutational analysis gave a positive result in four out of seven (57.1%) cases. All four positive tumors showed RAS mutation and one an additional mutation in PIK3CA. Urachal tumors exhibit peculiar morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features. Due to the advanced stage at presentation, individualized treatment should be undertaken.

AB BACKGROUND: Major guidelines do not recommend routine molecular profiling of lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC) because the prevalence of actionable alterations is thought to be low. Increased utilization of next-generation sequencing (NGS), particularly with cell-free circulating tumor DNA, facilitates reevaluation of this premise. PATIENTSAND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of actionable alterations in 2 distinct LUSC cohorts totaling 492 patients. A total of 410 consecutive patients with stage 3B or 4 LUSC were tested with a targeted cell-free circulating DNA NGS assay, and 82 patients with LUSC of any stage were tested with a tissue NGS cancer panel.; RESULTS: In the overall cohort, 467 patients (94.9%) had a diagnosis of LUSC, and 25 patients (5.1%) had mixed histology with a squamous component. A total of 10.5% of the LUSC subgroup had somatic alterations with therapeutic relevance, including in EGFR (2.8%), ALK/ROS1 (1.3%), BRAF (1.5%), and MET amplification or exon 14 skipping (5.1%). Sixteen percent of patients with mixed histology had an actionable alteration. In the LUSC subgroup, 3 evaluable patients were treated with targeted therapy for an actionable alteration; all of them experienced partial response.; CONCLUSION: In this large, real-world LUSC cohort, we observed a clinically significant prevalence of actionable alterations. Accurate local histopathologic assessment in advanced-stage LUSC can be challenging. Further evaluation of the genomic landscape in this setting is warranted to potentially identify underappreciated treatment options. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Glioblastomas (GB) are malignant brain tumors with poor prognosis despite treatment with surgery and radio/chemotherapy. These tumors are defined by an important cellular heterogeneity and notably contain a subpopulation of GB-initiating cells (GIC), which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Some integrins are specifically expressed by GICs and could be actionable targets to improve GB treatment. Here, integrin beta8 (ITGB8) was identified as a potential selective target in this highly tumorigenic GIC subpopulation. Using several patient-derived primocultures, it was demonstrated that ITGB8 is overexpressed in GICs compared with their differentiated progeny. Furthermore, ITGB8 is also overexpressed in GB, and its overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis and with the expression of several other classic stem cell markers. Moreover, inhibiting ITGB8 diminished several main GIC characteristics and features, including self-renewal ability, stemness, migration potential, and tumor formation capacity. Blockade of ITGB8 significantly impaired GIC cell viability via apoptosis induction. Finally, the combination of radiotherapy and ITGB8 targeting radiosensitized GICs through postmitotic cell death. IMPLICATIONS: This study identifies ITGB8 as a new selective marker for GICs and as a promising therapeutic target in combination with chemo/radiotherapy for the treatment of highly aggressive brain tumors. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is the most commonly mutated metabolic enzyme in human malignancy. A heterozygous genetic alteration, arginine 132, promotes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Although pharmacologic inhibitors of mutant IDH1 are promising, resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy are not understood. Additionally, the role of wild-type IDH1 (WT.IDH1) in cancer requires further study. Recently, it was observed that the regulatory RNA-binding protein, HuR (ELAVL1), protects nutrient-deprived cancer cells without IDH1 mutations, by stabilizing WT.IDH1 transcripts. In the present study, a similar regulatory effect on both mutant (Mut.IDH1) and WT.IDH1 transcripts in heterozygous IDH1-mutant tumors is observed. In ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assays of IDH1-mutant cell lines, wild-type and mutant IDH1 mRNAs each bound to HuR. Both isoforms were profoundly downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels after genetic suppression of HuR (siRNAs or CRISPR deletion) in HT1080 (R132C IDH1 mutation) and BT054 cells (R132H). Proliferation and invasion were adversely affected after HuR suppression and metabolomic studies revealed a reduction in Pentose Phosphate Pathway metabolites, nucleotide precursors, and 2-HG levels. HuR-deficient cells were especially sensitive to stress, including low glucose conditions or a mutant IDH1 inhibitor (AGI-5198). IDH1-mutant cancer cells were rescued by WT.IDH1 overexpression to a greater extent than Mut.IDH1 overexpression under these conditions. This study reveals the importance of HuR's regulation of both mutant and wild-type IDH1 in tumors harboring a heterozygous IDH1 mutation with implications for therapy. IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the HuR-IDH1 (mutant and wild-type IDH1) regulatory axis as a critical, actionable therapeutic target in IDH1-mutated cancer, and incomplete blockade of the entire HuR-IDH1 survival axis would likely diminish the efficacy of drugs that selectively target only the mutant isoenzyme. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Many international medical graduates (IMGs) enter North American residency programs every year. The Canadian IMG physician pool increasingly includes Canadian-born IMGs (C-IMGs) along with Immigrant-IMGs (I-IMGs). Similar trends exist in the United States. Our objective was to understand the similarities and differences in the challenges faced by both I-IMGs and C-IMGs during residency to identify actionable recommendations to support them during this critical time. We performed a multiple case study of IMGs' experiences at a large Canadian university. Within our two descriptive cases (I-IMGs, C-IMGs) we iteratively conducted twenty-two semi-structured interviews; we thematically analyzed our data within, between, and across both cases to understand challenges to IMGs' integration and opportunities for curricular innovations to facilitate their adaptation process. Research team members with different perspectives contributed reflexively to the thematic analysis. Participants identified key differences between medical culture and knowledge expected in Canada and the health systems and curricula in which they originally trained. I-IMG and C-IMG participants perceived two major challenges: discrimination because of negative labelling as IMGs and difficulties navigating their initial residency months. C-IMGs described a third challenge: frustration around the focus on the needs of I-IMGs. Participants from both groups identified two major opportunities: their desire to help other IMGs and a need for mentorship. I-IMGs and C-IMGs face diverse challenges during their training, including disorientation and discrimination. We identified specific objectives to inform the design of curriculum and support services that residency programs can offer trainees as well as important targets for resident education and faculty development.

AB PURPOSE: Mutations in PALB2 have been associated with a predisposition to breast and pancreatic cancers. This study aims to characterize a novel PALB2 synonymous variant c.18G>T (p.Gly6=) identified in a family with pancreatic and breast cancers.; METHODS: The PALB2 c.18G>T (p.Gly6=) variant in this family was identified using Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT). RT-PCR and subsequent cloning were performed to investigate whether this variant affects normal splicing.; RESULTS: This variant completely disrupts normal splicing and leads to several abnormal transcripts, which presumably leads to premature protein truncation. The major abnormal transcript resulted in a deletion of 32 base pairs in exon 1 and frameshift.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PALB2 c.18G>T (p.Gly6=) variant is likely pathogenic. This study provided important laboratory evidence for classification of this variant and guided improved patient management.

AB PURPOSE: The identification of carriers of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) gene variants through family cancer history alone is suboptimal, and most population-based genetic testing studies have been limited to founder mutations in high-risk populations. Here, we determine the clinical utility of identifying actionable variants in a healthy cohort of women.; METHODS: Germline DNA from a subset of healthy Australian women participating in the lifepool project was screened using an 11-gene custom sequencing panel. Women with clinically actionable results were invited to attend a familial cancer clinic (FCC) for post-test genetic counseling and confirmatory testing. Outcomes measured included the prevalence of pathogenic variants, and the uptake rate of genetic counseling, risk reduction surgery, and cascade testing.; RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 5908 women (0.64%) carried a clinically actionable pathogenic variant. Forty-two percent of pathogenic variant carriers did not have a first-degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer and 89% pursued referral to an FCC. Forty-six percent (6/13) of eligible women pursued risk reduction surgery, and the uptake rate of cascade testing averaged 3.3 family members per index case.; CONCLUSION: Within our cohort, HBOC genetic testing was well accepted, and the majority of high-risk gene carriers identified would not meet eligibility criteria for genetic testing based on their existing family history.

AB Oncogenic BRAF fusions have emerged as an alternate mechanism for BRAF activation in melanomas and other cancers. A number of BRAF fusions with different 5' gene partners and BRAF exon breakpoints have been described, but the effects of different partners and breakpoints on cancer phenotypes and treatment responses has not been well characterized. Targeted RNA sequencing was used to screen 60 melanoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for BRAF fusions. We identified three unique BRAF fusions, including a novel SEPT3-BRAF fusion, occurring in four tumors (4/60, 6.7%), all of which were "pan-negative" (lacking other common mutations) (4/18, 22.2%). The BRAF fusion PDX models showed variable growth rates and responses to MAPK inhibitors in vivo. Overexpression of BRAF fusions identified in our study, as well as other BRAF fusions previously identified in melanomas, resulted in a high degree of variability in 2D proliferation and 3D invasion between the different fusions. While exogenously expressed BRAF fusions all responded to MAPK inhibition in vitro, we observed potential differences in signaling and feedback mechanisms. In summary, BRAF fusions are actionable therapeutic targets, however there are significant differences in phenotypes, treatment responses, and signaling which may be clinically relevant.

AB PURPOSE: Genomic sequencing can reveal variants with limited to no medical actionability. Previous research has assessed individuals' intentions to learn this information, but few report the decisions they made and why.; METHODS: The North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next Generation Exome Sequencing (NCGENES) project evaluated adult patients randomized to learn up to six types of non-medically actionable secondary findings (NMASF). We previously found that most participants intended to request NMASF and intentions were strongly predicted by anticipated regret. Here we examine discrepancies between intentions and decisions to request NMASF, hypothesizing that anticipated regret would predict requests but that this association would be mediated by participants' intentions.; RESULTS: Of the 76% who expressed intentions to learn results, only 42% made one or more requests. Overall, only 32% of the 155 eligible participants requested NMASF. Analyses support a plausible causal link between anticipated regret, intentions, and requests.; CONCLUSIONS: The discordance between participants' expressed intentions and their actions provides insight into factors that influence patients' preferences for genomic information that has little to no actionability. These findings have implications for the timing and methods of eliciting preferences for NMASF and suggest that decisions to learn this information have cognitive and emotional components.

AB This study quantified changes in off-axis manual force production and upper extremity joint moments during sub-maximal one-handed push and pull tasks. Off-axis forces in the up/down and left/right directions were quantified in the presence or absence of constraints placed upon the direction of manual force application and/or arm posture. Resultant off-axis forces of 13.1% and 9.4% were produced for pulls and pushes, respectively. Off-axis forces during pulling were oriented downwards and to the right and were associated with a decreased should flexion moment when posture was constrained. Off-axis forces in the up/down direction were minimized with increased on-axis force level. Off-axis forces during pushing tended to be oriented to the left and were associated with increased elbow flexion moment when off-axis forces were allowed. By not accounting for these off-axis forces, we may not be accurately reflecting actionable muscle- and joint-level loading characteristics derived from biomechanically-based proactive ergonomics assessment approaches. Practitioner Summary: Constrained arm postures and directions of manual force application influence the production of off-axis forces. As inaccurate estimation of true manual forces can markedly influence actionable outcomes of proactive ergonomic assessments, this study suggests that simplification of these estimates is insufficient and potentially misleading.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous molecular subtyping for bladder carcinoma (BLCA) involved <450 samples, with diverse classifications.; OBJECTIVE: To identify molecular subtypes by curating a large BLCA dataset.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Gene expression publicly available were combined and reanalyzed. The dataset contained 2411 unique tumors encompassing non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BLCA (MIBC). Subtypes were reproduced on The Cancer Genome Atlas, UROMOL, and IMvigor210.; INTERVENTION: Subtypes were assigned by gene expression.; OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for subtype-clinical outcome correlations; Chi-square/Fisher exact tests were used for subtype-clinicopathological parameters associations.; RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We identified six molecular subtypes with different overall survival (OS) and molecular features. Subtype Neural-like (median OS, 87 mo) is prevalent in MIBC and characterized by high WNT/beta-catenin signaling. HER2-like (107.7 mo) is distributed evenly across NMIBC and MIBC, with higher ERBB2 amplification and signaling. Papillary-like (>135 mo), an NMIBC subtype enriched in urothelial differentiation genes, shows a high frequency of actionable FGFR3 mutations, amplifications, and FGFR3-TACC3 fusion. Luminal-like (91.7 mo), predominantly NMIBC, has higher MAPK signaling and more KRAS and KMT2C/D mutations than other subtypes. Mesenchymal-like (MES; 86.6 mo) and Squamous-cell carcinoma-like (SCC; 20.6 mo) are predominant in MIBC. MES is high in AXL signaling, whereas SCC has elevated PD1, CTLA4 signaling, and macrophage M2 infiltration. About 20% of NMIBCs show MIBC subtype traits and a lower 5-yr OS rate than Papillary-like NMIBC (81% vs 96%). The main limitations of our study are the incomplete clinical annotation, and the analyses were based on transcriptome subset due to comparisons across gene expression quantification technologies.; CONCLUSIONS: BLCA can be stratified into six molecular subtypes. NMIBC, with a high risk of progression, displays the molecular features of MIBC.; PATIENT SUMMARY: Biomarkers are urgently needed to guide patient treatment selection and avoid unnecessary toxicities in those who fail to respond. We believe molecular subtyping is a promising way to tailor disease management for those who will benefit most. Copyright © 2018 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB PURPOSE: Clinical laboratories performing exome or genome sequencing (ES/GS) are familiar with the challenges associated with proper consenting for and reporting of medically actionable secondary findings based on recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Misattributed parentage is another type of unanticipated finding a laboratory may encounter during family-based ES/GS; however, there are currently no professional recommendations related to the proper consenting for and reporting of misattributed parentage encountered during ES/GS.; METHODS: We surveyed 10 clinical laboratories offering family-based ES/GS regarding their consent language, discovery, and reporting of misattributed parentage.; RESULTS: Many laboratories have already developed their own practices/policies for these issues, which do not necessarily agree with those from other labs.; CONCLUSION: There are several other possibilities besides true misattributed parentage that could result in similar laboratory findings, and laboratories often feel they lack sufficient information to make formal conclusions on a report regarding the true genetic relatedness of the submitted samples. However, understanding the genetic relatedness (or lack thereof) of the samples submitted for family-based ES/GS has medical relevance. Therefore, professional recommendations for the appropriate handling of suspected misattributed parentage encountered during ES/GS are needed to help standardize current clinical laboratory practices.

AB The difference noted in Rotavirus vaccine efficiency between high and low income countries correlates with the lack of universal access to clean water and higher standards of hygiene. Overcoming these obstacles will require great investment and also time, therefore more effective vaccines should be developed to meet the needs of those who would benefit the most from them. Increasing our current knowledge of mucosal immunity, response to Rotavirus infection and its modulation by circadian rhythms could point at actionable pathways to improve vaccination efficacy, especially in the case of individuals affected by environmental enteropathy. Also, a better understanding and validation of Rotavirus entry factors as well as the systematic monitoring of dominant strains could assist in tailoring vaccines to individual's needs. Another aspect that could improve vaccine efficiency is targeting to M cells, for which new ligands could potentially be sought. Finally, alternative mucosal adjuvants and vaccine expression, storage and delivery systems could have a positive impact in the outcome of Rotavirus vaccination.

AB Hypertension and dyslipidemia are often suboptimally managed in teens with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Teen and parent perspectives on hypertension and dyslipidemia management need further study to enhance the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management plans. We sought to describe barriers to and strategies for CVD risk factor management. Teens with T1D with and without dyslipidemia and parents of teens with T1D with and without dyslipidemia underwent one-on-one semi-structured interviews conducted by trained personnel at a diabetes center; interviews continued until thematic saturation was reached. Teens and parents of teens described their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding heart health and CVD risk factors (hypertension and dyslipidemia). Researchers undertook a content analysis and categorized central themes as strategies and barriers. In total, 22 teens and 25 parents completed interviews. Teens were 17.4 ± 1.7years old with T1D duration 9.7 ± 4.0years; 45% had dyslipidemia. Parents were between 41 and 60 years old, 84% were mothers, and 40% had teens with dyslipidemia. Barriers to heart health included an obesity-promoting environment, parental distrust of medications, and limited teen knowledge about hypertension and dyslipidemia. Strategies included specific and realistic guidance from providers, family support of teen lifestyle management, and having exercise partners. While teen and parent perspectives were often similar, some themes applied only to teens or parents. Central themes provide actionable guidance to enhance hypertension and dyslipidemia management. Providers should consider teen and parent perspectives when managing CVD risk factors to enhance engagement with CVD risk management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Common polymorphisms in the genes encoding CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 enzymes have an important role in predicting the occurrence of adverse effects and the efficacy of substrate medications. Drug-induced changes to the enzyme's phenotype, a process called phenoconversion, comprise another important factor contributing to interindividual variability in drug response. To date, there is lack of data on the frequency of these common polymorphisms and phenoconversion in the pan-ethnic Australian population. The aim of this study wasto (1) describe allele, genotype and phenotype frequencies for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 enzymes in the pan-ethnic Australian population and (2) evaluate the frequency of actionable pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants and phenoconversion. Frequencies were calculated using the records of 5408 Australian patients (obtained from myDNA's propriety database), who were consecutively tested with the DNAdose PGx test which included the CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. In 2509 patients with listed medications at the time of testing, phenoconversion frequencies were calculated for CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 enzymes. Allele, genotype and phenotype frequencies in our Australian patients correlated with a Caucasian population. Approximately 96% of patients had at least one actionable PGx variant. A five-fold increase in the frequency of poor metabolisers (PMs) for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 was predicted by phenoconversion. Our study results indicate a high frequency of actionable PGx variants in our Australian population. With the addition of drug-induced phenoconversion, our results provide further support for the utilisation of PGx testing in clinical practice as another tool assisting prescribers in the application of personalised medicine.

AB Measurement of genetically altered DNA shed from tumours into the circulation can potentially provide a new generation of blood-based cancer biomarkers. Compared with tissue DNA biomarkers which require surgery or biopsy, samples for circulating tumour DNA assays can be obtained with minimal inconvenience and at lower cost. Furthermore, in contrast to tissue, the use of circulating tumour DNA allows serial monitoring, faster delivery of results and potentially provides an integrative representation of genetic alterations across all tumour sites within a patient. In contrast to existing protein-based cancer biomarkers, all of which can be produced by benign disease, circulating tumour DNA biomarkers would be expected to be more specific for malignancy. Furthermore, unlike the available blood cancer biomarkers, circulating tumour DNA can be used to predict response to specific therapies, identify mechanisms of therapy resistance and detect potentially actionable mutations. One of the first circulating tumour DNA assays recommended for clinical use involves EGFR mutation testing for predicting response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, especially when tumour tissue is unavailable. In order to accelerate the introduction of circulating tumour DNA assays into routine clinical use, laboratory medicine staff will have to undergo training in the use of polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, existing circulating tumour DNA assays will need to be simplified, standardized, shown to have clinical utility, be made available at reasonable costs and be reimbursable.

AB Genomic instability is a hallmark feature of cancer cells, and can be caused by defective DNA repair, for instance due to inactivation of BRCA2. Paradoxically, loss of Brca2 in mice results in embryonic lethality, whereas cancer cells can tolerate BRCA2 loss. This holds true for multiple DNA repair genes, and suggests that cancer cells are molecularly "rewired" to cope with defective DNA repair and the resulting high levels of genomic instability. In this study, we aim to identify genes that genomically unstable cancer cells rely on for their survival. Using functional genomic mRNA (FGmRNA) profiling, 16,172 cancer samples were previously ranked based on their degree of genomic instability. We analyzed the top 250 genes that showed a positive correlation between FGmRNA levels and the degree of genomic instability, in a co-functionality network. Within this co-functionality network, a strong cluster of 11 cell cycle-related genes was identified, including TPX2. We then assessed the dependency on these 11 genes in the context of survival of genomically unstable cancer cells, induced by BRCA2 inactivation. Depletion of TPX2 or its associated kinase Aurora-A preferentially reduced cell viability in a panel of BRCA2-deficient cancer cells. In line with these findings, BRCA2-depleted and BRCA2-mutant human cell lines, or tumor cell lines derived from Brca2-/-;p53-/- mice showed increased sensitivity to the Aurora-A kinase inhibitor alisertib, with delayed mitotic progression and frequent mitotic failure. Our findings reveal that BRCA2-deficient cancer cells show enhanced sensitivity to inactivation of TPX2 or its partner Aurora-A, which points at an actionable dependency of genomically unstable cancers.

AB Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), encoded by ESR1, is detected by immunohistochemistry in approximately 70% of invasive breast cancers and serves as a strong predictive biomarker. ESR1-activating mutations in the ligand-binding domain have been reported in up to 35-40% of ER-positive metastatic breast cancers and are associated with endocrine therapy resistance and disease progression. At present, it is unclear whether ESR1 mutations alter the immunohistochemical detection of ER performed in routine clinical practice. In this study, ESR1 mutations in breast cancer were identified utilizing Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a Food and Drug Administration-approved hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay. Five hundred and eighty-six breast cancers from patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease were analyzed using MSK-IMPACT in the study period. ESR1 somatic alterations were identified in 67 breast cancer samples from 66 patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of ER, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was performed on the primary and treated breast cancers from these patients at the time of diagnosis. Twenty unique ESR1 mutations were identified involving the ligand-binding domain, all in breast cancer samples from patients previously treated with endocrine therapy. The most frequent mutations were D538G (n=22), Y537S (n=7), and E380Q (n=7). All breast cancer samples with an ESR1 mutation were ER-positive by immunohistochemistry. Review of the ER immunohistochemistry in the paired untreated primary tumor and treated tumor from 34 patients showed no detectable change in the ER-positive immunohistochemical status (median percentage of invasive tumor cells with nuclear staining: untreated primary tumor 90%, treated tumor 95%). We conclude that ESR1 mutations do not appreciably diminish ER-positive staining by immunohistochemistry. In addition to standard biomarker testing by immunohistochemistry, the assessment of ESR1 mutations by molecular testing can help guide the clinical management of patients with ER-positive breast cancer in the setting of endocrine resistance and progression of disease.

AB Children may visit the emergency department (ED) regularly in part because they and their caregivers may be experiencing barriers to appropriate and timely pediatric care. However, assessing the wide range of potential barriers to access to care that children and their caregivers may experience is often a challenge. The objective of this study was to assess the barriers to pediatric health care reported by caregivers and to examine the association between those reported barriers to care with the frequency of children's ED visits in the past 12 months. Assessment of ED utilization and access to care barriers was made through a telephone interview survey conducted as part of a broader Community Health Needs Assessment in 2015. A weighted community sample of adult caregivers (N=1057) of children between the ages of 0-17 residing in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, Florida were contacted. This study found that multiple ED visits (≥2 vs. 0) in the past 12 months by a child were most strongly associated with access to care barriers attributed to language and culture (relative risk [RR]=2.51), trouble finding a doctor (RR=1.86), scheduling an appointment (RR=1.68), and transportation access (RR=1.73). These findings suggest that access to care barriers experienced by households may exacerbate the risk of a child experiencing repeated visits to the ED in a year. Findings are discussed further in the context of actionable population health management strategies to reduce risk of frequent ED utilization by children.

AB Mutations of Hepatocyte-Nuclear-Factor-1-Homeobox-A (HNF1A) gene and loss of Liver-Fatty-Acid-Binding-Protein (LFABP) are well documented in hepatocellular adenoma. However, the role of HNF1A mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma remains to be determined. In this study, all hepatocellular neoplasms evaluated by our institutional Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutational Profiling of Actionable Clinical Targets assay or the Cancer Genome Atlas sequencing, and cases reported in the literature, were queried for HNF1A mutations. Together, 11 of 672 (1.6%) hepatocellular carcinomas harbored HNF1A mutations. The single case from our institution (n = 153) was extremely well differentiated, arising in a background of adenomatosis. Both the adenoma and carcinoma component contained the same 2 somatic HNF1A mutations (p. E32* and L214Q), with loss of LFABP. From the literature, 2 of 146 (1.4%) hepatocellular carcinomas had HNF1A mutations, and both arose in a background of adenomatosis. Information on pre-existing adenoma for the remaining cases (8/373, from The Cancer Genome Atlas) was not available. HNF1A mutations in carcinomas were associated with negative viral hepatitis status (p = .004), mutually exclusive with catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) hotspot mutations, and trended to occur more in females (p = .06) and without cirrhosis (p = .03). Grade was not associated with HNF1A status (p = .28). Somatic HNF1A mutations occur in approximately 1% to 2% of hepatocellular carcinoma, often in a background of adenomatosis. Our findings suggest that malignant transformation of HNF1A-mutated hepatocellular adenoma occurs, albeit infrequently. Hepatocellular adenomas with HNF1A mutation or adenomatosis with loss of LFABP warrant thorough sampling and examination. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The impacts of alternative responses to a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak occurring in the Midwestern United States are estimated using the Regional Economic Modelling Incorporated Policy Insight + (REMI) computable general equilibrium model, with particular attention paid to the employment impact estimates. The impact on employment and GDP is estimated using forecasts of a 10-year period with disease outbreak duration up to 2years. Fifteen different vaccination protocols are compared to a disease control protocol that relies on animal depopulation with no vaccination. Results show that over the 10-year study period, the strictly depopulation strategy that made no use of vaccination results in approximately 677,000 jobs lost with $47 billion GDP loss. Based on the analysis conducted, losses can be reduced through protocols that utilize vaccination strategies. Through a vaccinate-to-live strategy with the highest vaccination capacity and largest vaccination zone, savings can be as many as 509,000 jobs in comparison to the strategy that relies strictly on slaughter with no use of vaccination. By including detailed job losses by occupation, this study highlights the downstream employment effects and shows that job losses resulting from an FMD outbreak can go far beyond the farm sector impacts that have been reported in earlier studies. Understanding the impacts on employment by sector provides more actionable information than producer and consumer surplus estimates frequently reported in economic impact studies. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB Health care is increasingly data driven. Concurrently, there are concerns that health professionals lack the time and training to guide patients through the growing medical "data jungle." In the age of big data, ever wider domains of people's lives are "datafied," which renders ever more information-at least in principle-usable for health care purposes. Turning data into meaningful information for clinical practice-and deciding what data or information should not be used for this purpose-requires a significant amount of time, resources, and skill. The authors argue that academic medicine should lead the way in navigating the use of complex, highly personal data in clinical practice. To make data actionable for both clinicians and patients, the authors propose that the best way to navigate the interface between patients and providers in the era of data-rich medicine would be the creation of a new profession entirely: health information counselors (HICs). HICs would have broad knowledge of various kinds of health data and data quality evaluation techniques, as well as analytic skills in statistics and data interpretation. Trained also in interpersonal communication, health management, insurance systems, and medico-legal aspects of data privacy, HICs would know enough about clinical medicine to advise on the relevance of any kind of data for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The creation of this new specialty would help patients and health care professionals to make more informed choices about how increasing amounts of health data and information can or should inform health care.

AB Responding to an unprecedented increase in the suicide rate among soldiers, in 2008 the US Army and US National Institute of Mental Health funded the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), a multicomponent epidemiological and neurobiological study of risk and resilience factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and their psychopathological correlates among Army personnel. Using a combination of administrative records, representative surveys, computerized neurocognitive tests, and blood samples, Army STARRS and its longitudinal follow-up study (STARRS-LS) are designed to identify potentially actionable findings to inform the Army's suicide prevention efforts. The current report presents a broad overview of Army STARRS and its findings to date on suicide deaths, attempts, and ideation, as well as other important outcomes that may increase suicide risk (e.g., mental disorders, sexual assault victimization). The findings highlight the complexity of environmental and genetic risk and protective factors in different settings and contexts, and the importance of life and career history in understanding suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

AB Transdisciplinary education is an effective strategy to foster important skills, such as collaboration, needed in the health professions. One Health recognizes the interconnected nature of human health to ecological and animal systems providing a framework for medical educators to create transdisciplinary programs. Medical educators should emphasize One Health as a problem solving strategy and create actionable classroom objectives via distilling One Health into comprehensible concepts. This will foster a collaborative learning atmosphere between human and non-human disciplines leading to positive outcomes for both the student and teacher. Transdisciplinary education is vital to health education and will allow students and teachers to use these concepts in every day practice to become innovators of health care.

AB BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS) to detect actionable genetic abnormalities is standard of care in advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma. Many studies have shown that the molecular results obtained from fine needle aspiration cytology material are comparable to those obtained from formalin-fixed tissue samples. We undertook this study to validate DNA extraction from cytology material for molecular studies and to find any correlation between DNA yield, pattern of tumour cells and tumour fraction.; METHODS: DNA was extracted from 34 cytology slides of pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases with predetermined EGFR mutation status. Cytology slides were reviewed for pattern of tumour distribution and tumour fraction. NGS was performed on five slides with variable DNA and compared with original results.; RESULTS: There were 14 alcohol-fixed and 20 air-dried smears. The mean DNA yield was 1.74mug and median of 0.4mug (range, 0.02-21mug). Tumour fractions varied from 10% to 90%. No correlation was found between tumour fraction and DNA yield (P=0.14). The mean DNA yield was high in slides with tumour throughout the slide (sheets or scattered clusters) as compared to rare scattered clusters and/or single cells. EGFR mutation was found in four of the five cases sent for NGS lung panel while one case revealed BRAF mutation.; CONCLUSIONS: DNA with good quantity and quality can be extracted from the cytology slides for NGS irrespective of type of fixation. DNA yield has better correlation with distribution pattern of tumour cells on the slides rather than tumour fraction. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Identifying characteristics associated with struggling healthcare organisations may help inform improvement. Thus, we systematically reviewed the literature to: (1) Identify organisational factors associated with struggling healthcare organisations and (2) Summarise these factors into actionable domains.; METHODS: Systematic review of qualitative studies that evaluated organisational characteristics of healthcare organisations that were struggling as defined by below-average patient outcomes (eg, mortality) or quality of care metrics (eg, Patient Safety Indicators). Searches were conducted in MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science from database inception through February 8 2018. Qualitative data were analysed using framework-based synthesis and summarised into key domains. Study quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool.; RESULTS: Thirty studies (33 articles) from multiple countries and settings (eg, acute care, outpatient) with a diverse range of interviewees (eg, nurses, leadership, staff) were included in the final analysis. Five domains characterised struggling healthcare organisations: poor organisational culture (limited ownership, not collaborative, hierarchical, with disconnected leadership), inadequate infrastructure (limited quality improvement, staffing, information technology or resources), lack of a cohesive mission (mission conflicts with other missions, is externally motivated, poorly defined or promotes mediocrity), system shocks (ie, events such as leadership turnover, new electronic health record system or organisational scandals that detract from daily operations), and dysfunctional external relations with other hospitals, stakeholders, or governing bodies.; CONCLUSIONS: Struggling healthcare organisations share characteristics that may affect their ability to provide optimal care. Understanding and identifying these characteristics may provide a first step to helping low performers address organisational challenges to improvement.; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42017067367. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB PURPOSE: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder arising from uncontrolled muscle calcium release due to an abnormality in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-release mechanism triggered by halogenated inhalational anesthetics. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are still incomplete.; METHODS: We aimed to identify transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) variants within the entire coding sequence in patients who developed sensitivity to MH of unknown etiology. In vitro and in vivo functional studies were performed in heterologous expression system, trpv1-/- mice, and a murine model of human MH.; RESULTS: We identified TRPV1 variants in two patients and their heterologous expression in muscles of trpv1-/- mice strongly enhanced calcium release from SR upon halogenated anesthetic stimulation, suggesting they could be responsible for the MH phenotype. We confirmed the in vivo significance by using mice with a knock-in mutation (Y524S) in the type I ryanodine receptor (Ryr1), a mutation analogous to the Y522S mutation associated with MH in humans. We showed that the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine slows the heat-induced hypermetabolic response in this model.; CONCLUSION: We propose that TRPV1 contributes to MH and could represent an actionable therapeutic target for prevention of the pathology and also be responsible for MH sensitivity when mutated.

AB PURPOSE: Physicians increasingly receive genomic test results they did not order, which we term "unsolicited genomic results" (UGRs). We asked physicians how they think such results will affect them and their patients.; METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with adult and pediatric primary care and subspecialty physicians at four sites affiliated with a large-scale return-of-results project led by the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network. Twenty-five physicians addressed UGRs and (1) perceived need for actionability, (2) impact on patients, (3) health care workflow, (4) return of results process, and (5) responsibility for results.; RESULTS: Physicians prioritize actionability of UGRs and the need for clear, evidence-based "paths" for action coupled with clinical decision support (CDS). They identified potential harms to patients including anxiety, false reassurance, and clinical disutility. Clinicians worried about anticipated workflow issues including responding to UGRs and unreimbursed time. They disagreed about who was responsible for responding to UGRs.; CONCLUSION: The prospect of receiving UGRs for otherwise healthy patients raises important concerns for physicians. Their responses informed development of an in-depth survey for physicians following return of UGRs. Strategic workflow integration of UGRs will likely be necessary to empower physicians to serve their patients effectively.

AB PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the definition of actionability of secondary findings in childhood, using a screening framework.; METHODS: For 31 disorders on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics SF v.2.0 list, World Health Organization screening criteria were applied to assess actionability in childhood.; RESULTS: The age of onset was variable. We categorized disorders based on the proportion of cases that presented in childhood: rare (n=6), fewer than half the cases (n=9), the majority of cases (n=12), or unclear (n=4). The age at initiation of intervention was based on the youngest age of onset reported, not evidence of the benefit of early intervention. For 15 disorders, guidelines were supported by a moderate quality of evidence for at least one recommendation. Only tuberous sclerosis complex had recommendations based on high-quality evidence. All others were based on evidence of low or very low quality.; CONCLUSION: We propose that actionability in childhood should be based on the proportion of cases that manifest in childhood and the quality of the evidence supporting intervention recommendations. Ideally, disclosure in childhood would be limited to disorders for which a majority of cases present in childhood and for which interventions are supported by evidence of at least moderate quality (i.e., multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, retinoblastoma, tuberous sclerosis complex, Marfan syndrome, and Wilson's disease).

AB PURPOSE: We evaluated strategies for identifying disease-causing variants in genetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).; METHODS: Cardiomyopathy gene panel testing was performed in 532 DCM patients and 527 healthy control subjects. Rare variants in 41 genes were stratified using variant-level and gene-level characteristics.; RESULTS: A majority of DCM cases and controls carried rare protein-altering cardiomyopathy gene variants. Variant-level characteristics alone had limited discriminative value. Differentiation between groups was substantially improved by addition of gene-level information that incorporated ranking of genes based on literature evidence for disease association. The odds of DCM were increased to nearly 9-fold for truncating variants or high-impact missense variants in the subset of 14 genes that had the strongest biological links to DCM (P<0.0001). For some of these genes, DCM-associated variants appeared to be clustered in key protein functional domains. Multiple rare variants were present in many family probands, however, there was generally only one "driver" pathogenic variant that cosegregated with disease.; CONCLUSION: Rare variants in cardiomyopathy genes can be effectively stratified by combining variant-level and gene-level information. Prioritization of genes based on their a priori likelihood of disease causation is a key factor in identifying clinically actionable variants in cardiac genetic testing.

AB PURPOSE: Genetic testing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has long relied on Sanger sequencing of sarcomeric genes. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has catalyzed routine testing of additional genes of dubious HCM-causing potential. We used 19years of genetic testing results to define a reliable set of genes implicated in Mendelian HCM and assess the value of expanded NGS panels.; METHODS: We dissected genetic testing results from 1,198 single-center HCM probands and devised a widely applicable score to identify which genes yield effective results in the diagnostic setting.; RESULTS: Compared with early panels targeting only fully validated sarcomeric HCM genes, expanded NGS panels allow the prompt recognition of probands with HCM-mimicking diseases. Scoring by "diagnostic effectiveness" highlighted that PLN should also be routinely screened besides historically validated genes for HCM and its mimics.; CONCLUSION: The additive value of expanded panels in HCM genetic testing lies in the systematic screening of genes associated with HCM mimics, requiring different patient management. Only variants in a limited set of genes are highly actionable and interpretable in the clinic, suggesting that larger panels offer limited additional sensitivity. A score estimating the relative effectiveness of a given gene's inclusion in diagnostic panels is proposed.

AB PURPOSE: In genomics, the return of negative screening results for rare, medically actionable conditions in large unselected populations with low prior risk of disease is novel and may involve important and nuanced concerns for communicating their meaning. Recruitment may result in self-selection because of participants' personal or family history, changing the characteristics of the screened population and interpretation of both positive and negative findings; prior motivations may also affect responses to results.; METHODS: Using data from GeneScreen, an exploratory adult screening project that targets 17 genes related to 11 medically actionable conditions, we address four questions: (1) Do participants self-select based on actual or perceived risk for one of the conditions? (2) Do participants understand negative results? (3) What are their psychosocial responses? (4) Are negative results related to changes in reported health-related behaviors?; RESULTS: We found disproportionate enrollment of individuals at elevated prior risk for conditions being screened, and a need to improve communication about the nature of screening and meaning of negative screening results. Participants expressed no decision regret and did not report intention to change health-related behaviors.; CONCLUSION: This study illuminates critical challenges to overcome if genomic screening is to benefit the general population.

AB The utilization of genomic data to direct treatment for cancer patients represents the central tenet in precision oncology, in which a patient is matched to a specific drug or therapy based on the genetic drivers detected in his or her tumor rather than the tumor's histologic classification. The expected but not always realized outcomes of molecularly matched therapies include increased response rates, more durable responses, deeper responses, and decreased number of therapy-related side effects. In this review, we will discuss different facets of utilizing genomic data to direct the increasingly complex care of cancer patients. We discuss the enlarging compendium of actionable genomic alterations and the development of novel molecular diagnostic assays for clinical application. Finally, we present an overview of the growing number of genomics-driven clinical trials and conclude with a discussion of future challenges in the implementation of precision oncology.

AB Long recognized to confer an extremely poor prognosis, sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of renal cell carcinoma (sRCC) is a tumor phenotype that is finally beginning to be better understood on the molecular and genetic levels. With an overall incidence that ranges from 1 to 32% depending on associated RCC subtype, the survival of sarcomatoid RCC patients rarely exceeds 2years. The main reasons for its poor outcome include its aggressive biology, its tendency to present at an advanced or metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, its high rate of tumor recurrence after nephrectomy, and its limited response to systemic therapies. Molecular pathology studies suggest that sarcomatoid dedifferentiation originates from a focal epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) arising in the carcinomatous component of the tumor. It is hoped that the growing understanding of the molecular biology of sRCC will soon make it possible to adapt treatments based on the identification of actionable tumor alterations. The deliberate inclusion of these patients in the multicenter clinical trials of immune, targeted and combination therapies is a necessary next step in pioneering future treatment strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor exercises are effective in improving muscle strength and urinary incontinence symptoms. Increasingly popular mobile applications can be effective in teaching patients these exercises.; INTRODUCTION: A mobile application, Bwom©, aims to educate women about pelvic floor exercises with individually tailored plans relevant to the user's risk factors. The objective of this study is to assess the understandability and actionability of Bwom.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey of patients and providers at an academic medical center. The survey utilized the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT) validated by the U.S. Department of Health Services, which provides scores on understandability and actionability. Participants completed an initial demographic survey, used Bwom for 2 weeks, and then completed the PEMAT tool.; RESULTS: Twenty five patients and 22 providers participated in the study, for a total of 47 participants. Providers included gynecology residents and faculty (91%), pelvic floor physical therapists (5%), and other healthcare professionals (5%). The majority of patients were age 31-40 (70%) and Caucasian (55%). Thirty nine percent had not yet tried pelvic floor exercises on their own before the study. The mean understandability score was 93.8% (±11.7) and the mean actionability score was 91.7% (±16.3).; DISCUSSION: This study paves the way for future investigations into the effectiveness of this app in decreasing symptoms of pelvic floor weakness and incontinence.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Bwom shows promise as a mobile application to educate women about pelvic floor exercises by providing user-friendly actions in an understandable way.

AB PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a deadly disease in which precision medicine needs to be incorporated. We aimed to implement next-generation sequencing (NGS) in determining actionable targets to guide appropriate molecular targeted therapy in HNSCC patients.; Materials and Methods: Ninety-three tumors and matched blood samples underwent targeted sequencing of 244 genes using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with an average depth of coverage of greater than 1,000*. Clinicopathological data from patients were obtained from 17 centers in Korea, and were analyzed in correlation with NGS data.; RESULTS: Ninety-two of the 93 tumors were amenable to data analysis. TP53 was the most common mutation, occurring in 47 (51%) patients, followed by CDKN2A (n=23, 25%), CCND1 (n=22, 24%), and PIK3CA (n=19, 21%). The total mutational burden was similar between human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative vs. positive tumors, although TP53, CDKN2A and CCND1 gene alterations occurred more frequently in HPV-negative tumors. HPV-positive tumors were significantly associated with immune signature-related genes compared to HPV-negative tumors. Mutations of NOTCH1 (p=0.027), CDKN2A (p < 0.001), and TP53 (p=0.038) were significantly associated with poorer overall survival. FAT1 mutations were highly enriched in cisplatin responders, and potentially targetable alterations such as PIK3CA E545K and CDKN2A R58X were noted in 14 patients (15%).; CONCLUSION: We found several targetable genetic alterations, and our findings suggest that implementation of precision medicine in HNSCC is feasible. The predictive value of each targetable alteration should be assessed in a future umbrella trial using matched molecular targeted agents.

AB PURPOSE: With the emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, profiling a wide range of genomic alterations has become a possibility resulting in improved implementation of targeted cancer therapy. In Asian populations, the prevalence and spectrum of clinically actionable genetic alterations has not yet been determined because of a lack of studies examining high-throughput cancer genomic data.; Materials and Methods: To address this issue, 1,071 tumor samples were collected from five major cancer institutes in Korea and analyzed using targeted NGS at a centralized laboratory. Samples were either fresh frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) and the quality and yield of extracted genomic DNA was assessed. In order to estimate the effect of sample condition on the quality of sequencing results, tissue preparation method, specimen type (resected or biopsied) and tissue storage time were compared.; RESULTS: We detected 7,360 non-synonymous point mutations, 1,164 small insertions and deletions, 3,173 copy number alterations, and 462 structural variants. Fifty-four percent of tumors had one or more clinically relevant genetic mutation. The distribution of actionable variants was variable among different genes. Fresh frozen tissues, surgically resected specimens, and recently obtained specimens generated superior sequencing results over FFPE tissues, biopsied specimens, and tissues with long storage duration.; CONCLUSION: In order to overcome, challenges involved in bringing NGS testing into routine clinical use, a centralized laboratory model was designed that could improve the NGS workflows, provide appropriate turnaround times and control costs with goal of enabling precision medicine.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project was to build and formatively evaluate a near-real time heart failure (HF) data mart. Heart Failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospital readmissions. Increased efforts to use data meaningfully may enable healthcare organizations to better evaluate effectiveness of care pathways and quality improvements, and to prospectively identify risk among HF patients.; METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We followed a modified version of the Systems Development Life Cycle: 1) Conceptualization, 2) Requirements Analysis, 3) Iterative Development, and 4) Application Release. This foundational work reflects the first of a two-phase project. Phase two (in process) involves the implementation and evaluation of predictive analytics for clinical decision support.; RESULTS: We engaged stakeholders to build working definitions and established automated processes for creating an HF data mart containing actionable information for diverse audiences. As of December 2017, the data mart contains information from over 175,000 distinct patients and >100 variables from each of their nearly 300,000 visits.; CONCLUSION: The HF data mart will be used to enhance care, assist in clinical decision-making, and improve overall quality of care. This model holds the potential to be scaled and generalized beyond the initial focus and setting.

AB Cancer is a collection of genetic diseases, with large phenotypic differences and genetic heterogeneity between different types of cancers and even within the same cancer type. Recent advances in genome-wide profiling provide an opportunity to investigate global molecular changes during the development and progression of cancer. Meanwhile, numerous statistical and machine learning algorithms have been designed for the processing and interpretation of high-throughput molecular data. Molecular subtyping studies have allowed the allocation of cancer into homogeneous groups that are considered to harbor similar molecular and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, this has helped researchers to identify both actionable targets for drug design as well as biomarkers for response prediction. In this review, we introduce five frequently applied techniques for generating molecular data, which are microarray, RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, NanoString and tissue microarray. Commonly used molecular data for cancer subtyping and clinical applications are discussed. Next, we summarize a workflow for molecular subtyping of cancer, including data preprocessing, cluster analysis, supervised classification and subtype characterizations. Finally, we identify and describe four major challenges in the molecular subtyping of cancer that may preclude clinical implementation. We suggest that standardized methods should be established to help identify intrinsic subgroup signatures and build robust classifiers that pave the way toward stratified treatment of cancer patients. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB In 2013, a team of public health professionals at Tulane University launched a project to explore strategies for shaping a healthier Louisiana. The team investigated methods for improving diet and physical activity behaviors in early childhood, school, and community settings that could be translated into specific policies. Through key informant interviews and scans of academic journals and reports issued by public health agencies, the team generated a set of actionable steps that could increase healthful behaviors. Previous efforts to address similar topics in Louisiana and other states, and their reception from policy makers, were also considered during analysis. Subsequently, a state legislator used the team's work to introduce public health legislation in 2014. The legislation led to a number of incremental changes in state policy and resolutions for additional policy-relevant studies. This case study summarizes the promising physical activity and nutrition strategies that were considered by the Tulane team, how the team's work product was integrated into state legislation, the outcomes of the legislation, and a set of recommendations for how Louisiana can expand on this work. This article demonstrates how the work of public health professionals can have a positive influence on the policy-making process through research and education.

AB Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Some thousands of liver cancer genome have been sequenced globally so far and most of driver genes/mutations with high frequency are established in liver cancer, including Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, TP53/cell-cycle pathways, telomere maintenance, and chromatin regulators. HBV integration into cancer-related genes is also a driver event in hepatocarcinogenesis. These genes are affected by structural variants, copy-number alterations and virus integrations as well as point mutations. Etiological factors of liver cancer is most understood among common cancers, such as hepatitis, aflatoxin, alcohol, and metabolic diseases, and mutational signatures of liver cancer can provide evidence of the association between specific etiological factors and mutational signatures. Molecular classifications based on somatic mutations profiles, RNA expression profiles, and DNA methylation profiles are related with patient prognosis. For precision medicine, several actionable mutations with solid evidence such as targets of multi-kinase inhibitors is observed in liver cancer, but there is few molecular target therapy so far. It is possible that rare actionable mutations in liver cancer can guide other specific molecular therapy and immune therapy. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are on the rise, and there is a lack of new classes of drugs to treat these pathogens. This drug shortage is largely due to the challenge of finding antibiotics that can permeate and persist inside Gram-negative species. Efforts to understand the molecular properties that enable certain compounds to accumulate in Gram-negative bacteria based on retrospective studies of known antibiotics have not been generally actionable in the development of new antibiotics. A recent assessment of the ability of >180 diverse small molecules to accumulate in Escherichia coli led to predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. These "eNTRy rules" state that compounds are most likely to accumulate if they contain a nonsterically encumbered ionizable Nitrogen (primary amines are the best), have low Three-dimensionality (globularity ≤ 0.25), and are relatively Rigid (rotatable bonds ≤ 5). In this review, we look back through 50+ years of antibacterial research and 1000s of derivatives and assess this historical data set through the lens of these predictive guidelines. The results are consistent with the eNTRy rules, suggesting that the eNTRy rules may provide an actionable and general roadmap for the conversion of Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) and clinical feedback (CF) systems have become important tools for psychological therapies, but there are challenges for their successful implementation.; OBJECTIVE: To overcome these challenges, a greater understanding is needed about how patients experience the use of ROM/CF.; METHOD: We conducted a systematic literature search of qualitative studies on patient experiences with the use of ROM/CF in mental health services.; RESULTS: The findings from 16 studies were synthesized, resulting in four meta-themes: (1) Suspicion towards service providers, (2) Flexibility and support to capture complexity, (3) Empowering patients, and (4) Developing collaborative practice.; CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the implications of these meta-themes for further development and implementation of ROM/CF into clinical practice, acknowledging the limitations of our review and suggesting avenues for further research. Clinical or methodological significance of this article: This article provides useful and actionable knowledge about the patient perspective on ROM/CF, an important discussion on the current state of research in this area, and useful and concrete suggestions for further avenues of research.

AB Prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies reduce time and costs for maintenance of products or processes through efficient and cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic activities. PHM systems use real-time and historical state information of subsystems and components to provide actionable information, enabling intelligent decision-making for improved performance, safety, reliability, and maintainability. However, PHM is still an emerging field, and much of the published work has been either too exploratory or too limited in scope. Future smart manufacturing systems will require PHM capabilities that overcome current challenges, while meeting future needs based on best practices, for implementation of diagnostics and prognostics. This paper reviews the challenges, needs, methods, and best practices for PHM within manufacturing systems. This includes PHM system development of numerous areas highlighted by diagnostics, prognostics, dependability analysis, data management, and business. Based on current capabilities, PHM systems are shown to benefit from open-system architectures, cost-benefit analyses, method verification and validation, and standards.

AB Academic medical centers (AMCs) are transforming to improve their care delivery and learning environments so that they build a culture that fosters high-value care. However, AMCs struggle to create learning environments where trainees are part of the reason for institutional success and their initiatives have high impact and are sustainable. The authors believe that AMCs can reach these goals if they co-develop strategic priorities and provide infrastructure to support alignment between the missions of health delivery systems and graduate medical education (GME).They outline four steps for AMCs and policymakers to create an infrastructure that supports this alignment to deliver value-based care. First, AMCs can align strategic priorities between delivery systems and educators to achieve high-impact outcomes by creating a common understanding of prioritization drivers and increasing motivators for alignment. Second, AMCs can support alignment with data from multiple sources that are reliable, valid, and actionable for trainees. Third, resident initiatives can create sustained impact by linking trainees to the institutional staff and infrastructure supporting value improvement efforts. Fourth, incentive payment programs through medical education could augment current system incentives to propel further alignment between education and delivery systems. The authors support their recommendations with concrete examples from emerging models created by GME and health delivery system leaders at AMCs across the country.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many professions including nursing and medicine have developed subspecialties in the field of clinical informatics to assist in the management of patient outcomes. This report describes the development of a physical therapist-informatician (PT-I) that occurred concurrently with the introduction of an electronic health record (EHR).; CASE DESCRIPTION: A physical therapist supervisor participated in professional development to become a full-time PT-I within the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (DPMR) of an academic medical center. Cycles of needs assessment and gap analysis produced a nimble process that evolved to meet a shifting environment and to incorporate lessons learned.; OUTCOMES: The development of a full-time PT-I enabled the DPMR to become the stewards of mobility data across the enterprise. The benefits that accrued, as a result, included enhanced success of EHR adoption, decreased revenue loss, and actionable, meaningful data use.; DISCUSSION: Having a PT-I facilitate the adoption of informatics into DPMR culture enabled participation in enterprise-level EHR optimization. Standardized data from the EHR was used to improve the performance of clinicians throughout the hospital. The field of physical therapy could benefit from a targeted use of informatics to articulate the EHR workflow and data needs.

AB Background: The translation of genomic discoveries to the clinic is the cornerstone of precision medicine. However, incorporating next generation sequencing (NGS) of hematologic malignancies into clinical management remains limited. Methods: We describe 235 patients who underwent integrated NGS profiling (406 genes) and analyze the alterations and their potential actionability. Results: Overall, 227 patients (96.5%) had adequate tissue. Most common diagnoses included myelodysplastic syndrome (22.9%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (17.2%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13.2%), acute myeloid leukemia (11%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (9.2%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8.8%), and multiple myeloma (7.5%). Most patients (N = 197/227 (87%)) harbored ≥1 genomic alteration(s); 170/227 (75%), ≥1 potentially actionable alteration(s) targetable by an FDA-approved (mostly off-label) or an investigational agent. Altogether, 546 distinct alterations were seen, most commonly involving TP53 (10.8%), TET2 (4.6%), and DNMT3A (4.2%). The median tumor mutational burden (TMB) was low (1.7 alterations/megabase); 12% of patients had intermediate or high TMB (higher TMB correlates with favorable response to anti-PD1/PDL1 inhibition in solid tumors). In conclusion, 96.5% of patients with hematologic malignancies have adequate tissue for comprehensive genomic profiling. Most patients had unique molecular signatures, and 75% had alterations that may be pharmacologically tractable with gene- or immune-targeted agents.

AB BACKGROUND: RNA-seq is widely used for transcriptomic profiling, but the bioinformatics analysis of resultant data can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for biologists. We aim to streamline the bioinformatic analyses of gene-level data by developing a user-friendly, interactive web application for exploratory data analysis, differential expression, and pathway analysis.; RESULTS: iDEP (integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis) seamlessly connects 63 R/Bioconductor packages, 2 web services, and comprehensive annotation and pathway databases for 220 plant and animal species. The workflow can be reproduced by downloading customized R code and related pathway files. As an example, we analyzed an RNA-Seq dataset of lung fibroblasts with Hoxa1 knockdown and revealed the possible roles of SP1 and E2F1 and their target genes, including microRNAs, in blocking G1/S transition. In another example, our analysis shows that in mouse B cells without functional p53, ionizing radiation activates the MYC pathway and its downstream genes involved in cell proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and non-coding RNA metabolism. In wildtype B cells, radiation induces p53-mediated apoptosis and DNA repair while suppressing the target genes of MYC and E2F1, and leads to growth and cell cycle arrest. iDEP helps unveil the multifaceted functions of p53 and the possible involvement of several microRNAs such as miR-92a, miR-504, and miR-30a. In both examples, we validated known molecular pathways and generated novel, testable hypotheses.; CONCLUSIONS: Combining comprehensive analytic functionalities with massive annotation databases, iDEP ( http://ge-lab.org/idep/ ) enables biologists to easily translate transcriptomic and proteomic data into actionable insights.

AB Patients with aggressive breast cancer (BC) subtypes usually don't have favorable prognosis despite the improvement in treatment modalities. These cancers still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in females. This has fostered a major effort to discover actionable molecular targets to treat these patients. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) is one of these molecular targets that are under comprehensive investigation for treatment of such tumors. However, its role in the pathogenesis of BC from Middle Eastern ethnicity has not yet been explored. Therefore, we examined the expression of PARP protein in a large cohort of over 1000 Middle Eastern BC cases by immunohistochemistry. Correlation with clinico-pathological parameters were performed. Nuclear PARP overexpression was observed in 44.7% of all BC cases and was significantly associated with aggressive clinico-pathological markers. Interestingly, nuclear PARP overexpression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis. PARP overexpression was also directly associated with XIAP overexpression, with PARP and XIAP co-expression in 15.8% (159/1008) of our cases. We showed that combined inhibition of PARP by olaparib and XIAP by embelin significantly and synergistically inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in BC cell lines. Finally, co-treatment of olaparib and embelin regressed BC xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Our results revealed the role of PARP in Middle Eastern BC pathogenesis and prognosis. Furthermore, our data support the potential clinical development of combined inhibition of PARP and XIAP, which eventually could extend the utility of olaparib beyond BRCA deficient cancer.

AB An improved approach for predicting the risk for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) could lead to substantial improvements in cardiovascular health. Previously, we have shown that genetic and epigenetic loci could predict CHD status more sensitively than conventional risk factors. Herein, we examine whether similar machine learning approaches could be used to develop a similar panel for predicting incident CHD. Training and test sets consisted of 1180 and 524 individuals, respectively. Data mining techniques were employed to mine for predictive biosignatures in the training set. An ensemble of Random Forest models consisting of four genetic and four epigenetic loci was trained on the training set and subsequently evaluated on the test set. The test sensitivity and specificity were 0.70 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, the Framingham risk score and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimator performed with test sensitivities of 0.20 and 0.38, respectively. Notably, the integrated genetic-epigenetic model predicted risk better for both genders and very well in the three-year risk prediction window. We describe a novel DNA-based precision medicine tool capable of capturing the complex genetic and environmental relationships that contribute to the risk of CHD, and being mapped to actionable risk factors that may be leveraged to guide risk modification efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to bring health care closer to people with otherwise limited access to adequate health care. However, physiological monitoring using mobile medical sensors is not yet widely used as adding biomedical sensors to mHealth projects inherently introduces new challenges. Thus far, no methodology exists to systematically evaluate these implementation challenges and identify the related risks.; OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to facilitate the implementation of mHealth initiatives with mobile physiological sensing in constrained health systems by developing a methodology to systematically evaluate potential challenges and implementation risks.; METHODS: We performed a quantitative analysis of physiological data obtained from a randomized household intervention trial that implemented sensor-based mHealth tools (pulse oximetry combined with a respiratory rate assessment app) to monitor health outcomes of 317 children (aged 6-36 months) that were visited weekly by 1 of 9 field workers in a rural Peruvian setting. The analysis focused on data integrity such as data completeness and signal quality. In addition, we performed a qualitative analysis of pretrial usability and semistructured posttrial interviews with a subset of app users (7 field workers and 7 health care center staff members) focusing on data integrity and reasons for loss thereof. Common themes were identified using a content analysis approach. Risk factors of each theme were detailed and then generalized and expanded into a checklist by reviewing 8 mHealth projects from the literature. An expert panel evaluated the checklist during 2 iterations until agreement between the 5 experts was achieved.; RESULTS: Pulse oximetry signals were recorded in 78.36% (12,098/15,439) of subject visits where tablets were used. Signal quality decreased for 1 and increased for 7 field workers over time (1 excluded). Usability issues were addressed and the workflow was improved. Users considered the app easy and logical to use. In the qualitative analysis, we constructed a thematic map with the causes of low data integrity. We sorted them into 5 main challenge categories: environment, technology, user skills, user motivation, and subject engagement. The obtained categories were translated into detailed risk factors and presented in the form of an actionable checklist to evaluate possible implementation risks. By visually inspecting the checklist, open issues and sources for potential risks can be easily identified.; CONCLUSIONS: We developed a data integrity-based methodology to assess the potential challenges and risks of sensor-based mHealth projects. Aiming at improving data integrity, implementers can focus on the evaluation of environment, technology, user skills, user motivation, and subject engagement challenges. We provide a checklist to assist mHealth implementers with a structured evaluation protocol when planning and preparing projects. ©Jia Zhang, Laura Tushaus, Nestor Nuno Martinez, Monica Moreo, Hector Verastegui, Stella M Hartinger, Daniel Mausezahl, Walter Karlen.

AB INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The prevalence and incidence of chronic liver disease is increasing resulting in substantial direct and indirect medical costs. Overuse of investigations, treatments and procedures contribute to rising health care costs and can expose patients to unnecessary harm and delay in receiving care. The Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) campaign has encouraged profesional societies to develop statements that are directly actionable by their members in an effort to promote higher-value health care that will lead to downstream effect on how other practitioners make decisions.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL) established its Choosing Wisely top five list of recommendations using the framework put forward by CWC. CASL convened a task force that developed a list of draft recommendations and shared this with CASL membership electronically with eventual ranking of the top five recommendations by consensus at Canadian Digestives Disease Week (CDDW) 2017. Following revisions, the CASL Executive Committee endorsed the final list, which was disseminated online by CWC (July 2017).; RESULTS: The top five recommendations physicians and patients should question include: 1) Don't order serum ammonia to diagnose or manage hepatic encephalopathy (HE). 2) Don't routinely transfuse fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, or platelets to reverse abnormal tests of coagulation in patients with cirrhosis prior to abdominal paracentesis, endoscopic variceal band ligation, or any other minor invasive procedures. 3) Don't order HFE genotyping based on serum ferritin values alone to diagnose hereditary hemochromatosis. 4) Don't perform computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) routinely to monitor benign focal liver lesions. 5) Don't repeat hepatitis C viral load testing in an individual who has established chronic infection, outside of anti-viral treatment.; CONCLUSION: The Choosing Wisely recommendations will foster patient-physician discussions, reduce unnecessary treatment and testing, avert adverse effects from testing and treatment along with reducing medical expenditure in hepatology.

AB Precision oncologic medicine is an emerging approach for cancer treatment that has recently taken giant steps in solid clinical practice. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics that can analyze the individual tumor's variability in genes have provided greater understanding and additional strategies to treat cancers. Although tumors can be tested by several molecular methods, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly facilitated our understanding of pediatric cancer and identified additional therapeutic opportunities. Pediatric tumors have a different genetic make-up, with a fewer number of actionable targets than adult tumors. Nevertheless, precision oncology in the pediatric population has greatly improved the survival of patients with leukemia and solid tumors. This review discusses the current status of pediatric precision oncology and the different clinical scenarios in which it can be effectively applied.

AB High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven cancers represent a major health concern worldwide. Despite the constant effort to develop and promote vaccination against HPVs, there is still a high percentage of non-vaccinated population. Furthermore, secondary prevention programs are not ubiquitous worldwide and not widely followed. Metastatic disease is the cause of the great majority of cancer-associated deaths, making it essential to determine its underlying mechanisms and to identify actionable anti-metastatic targets. Within certain types of cancer (e.g., head and neck), HPV-positive tumors show different dissemination patterns when compared with their HPV-negative counterparts, implicating HPV-related factors in the metastatic process. Among the many groups of biomolecules dysregulated by HPV, microRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of carcinogenesis, able to control complex processes like cancer metastization. In this review, we present recent data on the role of microRNAs in the metastization of HPV-related cancers and on their possible clinical relevance as biomarkers of metastatic disease and/or as therapeutic targets.

AB BACKGROUND: As payment models shift toward a focus on value, an accurate understanding of surgical costs and preoperative correlates of high-cost patients is important for effective implementation of cost-saving strategies. This study used time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to explore inpatient cost of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and to identify preoperative characteristics of high-cost patients.; METHODS: Using TDABC, we calculated the cost of inpatient care for 415 patients undergoing elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017. Patients in the top decile of cost were defined as high-cost patients. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was employed to determine preoperative characteristics (e.g., demographics, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) associated with high-cost patients.; RESULTS: Implant purchase price was the main driver (57%) of total inpatient costs, followed by personnel cost from patient check-in through the time in the operating room (20%). There was a 1.3-fold variation in total cost between patients in the 90th percentile for cost and those in the 10th percentile; the widest cost variation was in personnel cost from the post-anesthesia care unit through discharge (2.5-fold) and in medication cost (2.4-fold). High-cost patients were more likely to be women and chronic opioid users and to have diabetes, depression, an ASA score of ≥3, a higher body mass index (BMI), and a lower preoperative ASES score than non-high-cost patients. After multivariable adjustment, the 3 predictors of high-cost patients were female sex, an ASA score of ≥3, and a lower ASES score. Total inpatient cost correlated strongly with the length of the hospital stay but did not correlate with operative time.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides actionable data to contain costs in the perioperative TSA setting. From the hospital's perspective, efforts to reduce implant purchase prices may translate into rapid substantial cost savings. At the patient level, multidisciplinary initiatives aimed at reducing length of stay and controlling medication expenses for patients at risk for high cost (e.g., infirm women with poor preoperative shoulder function) may prove effective in narrowing the existing patient-to-patient variation in costs.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis Level IV.

AB The Yemen cholera outbreak has been driven by years of conflict and has now become the largest in epidemiologically recorded history with more than 1.2 million cases since the beginning of the outbreak in April, 2017. In this report we review and discuss the cholera management strategies applied by the major international humanitarian health organizations present in Yemen. We find the response by the organizations examined to have been more focused on case management than on outbreak prevention. Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCVs) were not delivered until nearly 16months into the outbreak. A recent scale-up of the global OCV stockpile will hopefully allow for rapid mass deployment of the OCV in future humanitarian emergencies. Continuous funding to this stockpile will be crucial to maintain this option for prevention and control of cholera outbreaks. Of equal importance will be the timely recognition of the need for mass OCV deployment and development of more specific, comprehensive and actionable evidence-based frameworks to help guide this decision, however difficult this may be. The outbreak highlights the importance for international humanitarian health organizations to have a continuous discussion about whether and to what extent they should increase their focus on pre-emptively addressing the environmental determinants of communicable diseases in humanitarian emergencies. Strong advocacy from the public health community for peace and the protection of human health, by bringing to attention the public health impacts of armed conflict and keeping the world's political leaders accountable to their actions, will remain crucial.

AB BACKGROUND: This article critically explores the implementation and evaluation of a project designed, delivered and evaluated by frontline staff to improve prison responses to prisoner suicide and self-harm. We begin by evidencing the need for the project and detail its content, delivery and attempts at evaluation. We draw on the reflections of the three practitioners most closely involved in its development, delivery and review in order to explore lessons learned for future staff-led projects including those aimed at tackling prison suicide and self-harm.; RESULTS: Findings from staff reflections suggest that the development, implementation and evaluation of the project were influenced by a combination of issues around: project focus, communication and professional relationships, the institutional environment, funding and time, roll-out and evaluation, and the need for a 'champion' role.; CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence that the project left a modest positive legacy in terms of impact. A more substantial legacy of the project is provided in terms of actionable learning points for future projects of this nature.

AB Primary ductal adenocarcinoma of the lacrimal gland is a rare but highly aggressive epithelial malignancy with a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis, along with genetic testing of these tumors, is imperative for proper management. We present a case of a 54-year-old man with decreasing vision over the past three years and increasing proptosis in his right eye over the past three months, secondary to a lacrimal gland mass diagnosed as primary ductal adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis was made using histological and immunohistochemical profiles (positivity for cytokeratin AE1/3, CAM5.2, androgen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15) seen in previous cases, alongside a tumor genetic profile that showed actionable mutations. Uniquely in this case, after failing traditional chemotherapy, repeat biopsy revealed a change in genetics with the malignancy no longer showing actionable mutations. These findings show that these immunohistochemical findings can act as diagnostic biomarkers, while genetic testing can reveal actionable mutations for targeted therapy.

AB Disease-causing pathogens have been with humanity for as long as the species has existed, but the world has changed. The human population is increasing and becoming more globalised. Meanwhile, the international system remains unstable and biotechnology is advancing at a breakneck speed. Humans are coming into contact with new and re-emerging pathogens as they spread into previously uninhabited environments. Pathogens play an increasingly global role, and infectious disease is becoming less confined by geographical or climatic boundaries. In order to meet these new challenges, both states and the private sector have been building an increasing number of high-containment biological laboratories(HCBLs) that work with biosafety level (BSL) 3 and 4 pathogens. This rate has increased sharply since 11 September 2011, and most states that have the means to build such laboratories do so. Pathogens do not stop at borders, and the more prepared a state is to deal with them, the better for its national security. Although there is information available on the world's BSL-4 laboratories, none of it includes the proliferation of BSL-3 laboratories. This paper attempts to create a working database of the state of global HCBL proliferation. It seeks to analyse the data and to understand how we are dealing with this phenomenon, the risks involved, and the possible measures to be taken. The information is inevitably complex and certainly far from complete, but it is the author's hope that it will provide a sufficient basis from which to make useful, actionable inferences. 
A2 Si les maladies infectieuses sont presentes depuis que lhumanite existe,
   le monde, lui, a beaucoup change. La population humaine ne cesse de
   saccroitre et les echanges sont de plus en plus mondialises. Entretemps,
   le systeme international devient instable et les biotechnologies
   evoluent a une vitesse impressionnante. Les humains sont desormais
   exposes a un grand nombre dagents pathogenes nouveaux et re-emergents a
   mesure que ceux-ci se propagent dans des milieux precedemment inhabites.
   La dimension mondiale de limpact des agents pathogenes saccroit et les
   maladies infectieuses sont de moins en moins contenues par les barrieres
   geographiques ou climatiques. Afin de repondre a ces nouveaux defis, les
   gouvernements tout comme le secteur prive se sont lances dans la
   creation dun nombre croissant de laboratoires de confinement, dont ceux
   a haute securite, cest-a-dire les laboratoires de niveau de securite
   biologique 3 et 4 (BSL 3 et 4) qui sont autorises a manipuler des agents
   pathogenes presentant respectivement un risque biologique de niveau 3 et
   4. La proportion de ces laboratoires a fortement augmente depuis les
   attentats du11 septembre 2001 et la plupart des pays qui en ont les
   moyens se sont dotes de tels laboratoires. Les agents pathogenes ne
   sarretant pas aux frontieres, la securite nationale des pays est dautant
   mieux protegee que les pays se sont bien prepares a y faire face. Des
   informations sont disponibles sur les laboratoires de confinement a
   haute securite (BSL-4) dans le monde mais aucune de ces informations
   nanalyse la proliferation des laboratoires BSL-3. Lauteur a entrepris de
   creer une base de donnees de travail afin de faire le point sur letat
   actuel de proliferation des laboratoires biologiques de confinement a
   haute securite dans le monde. Larticle analyse les donnees reunies et
   tente dapprehender la maniere de traiter ce phenomene, ainsi que les
   risques qui lui sont associes et les mesures eventuelles a envisager.
   Les informations presentees sont a la fois inevitablement complexes et
   certainement tres incompletes ; neanmoins, lauteur espere quelles
   fourniront une base suffisante pour que des conclusions utiles puissent
   en etre tirees et etre traduites par des actes.Las enfermedades
   infeciosas son tan o mas antiguas que la humanidad, pero el mundo ha
   cambiado. La poblacion humana va en aumento y coloniza casi todos los
   rincones del globo. Mientras tanto, el sistema internacional sigue
   siendo inestable y la biotecnologia avanza a velocidad de vertigo. Al
   adentrarse en medios hasta entonces deshabitados, los humanos entran en
   contacto con patogenos nuevos o reemergentes. El papel de los patogenos
   cobra una dimension cada vez mas planetaria, y las enfermedades
   infecciosas franquean con creciente facilidad las fronteras geograficas
   y climaticas. Para responder a estos nuevos problemas, los sectores
   publico y privado han venido estableciendo un numero creciente de
   laboratorios biologicos de alta contencion que trabajan con patogenos de
   nivel 3 o 4 de seguridad biologica, a una cadencia que se ha acelerado
   radicalmente desde los atentados del 11de septiembre de 2001. Ahora,
   casi todos los Estados que tienen medios para hacerlo se dotan de tales
   laboratorios. Los patogenos no respetan frontera alguna, y cuanto mas
   preparado este un Estado para hacerles frente, mejor protegida estara su
   seguridad nacional. Aunque existe informacion sobre los laboratorios del
   mundo de nivel 4 de seguridad biologica, en ninguna de esas fuentes se
   recoge la proliferacion de laboratorios de nivel 3. El autor se refiere
   a la creacion de una base de datos operativa sobre el estado de la
   proliferacion mundial de laboratorios biologicos de alta contencion. Se
   trata con ello de analizar los datos al respecto y entender como estamos
   manejando este fenomeno, los riesgos que trae consigo y las medidas que
   cabria o convendria adoptar. La informacion es inevitablemente compleja
   y a todas luces muy incompleta, pero el autor espera que siente una base
   lo bastante solida como para extraer de ella conclusiones utiles, que
   puedan conducir a acciones concretas.

AB Hallmarks of the difficult period of transition from hospital to home following stroke include stroke survivor and caregiver uncertainty about actionable steps toward recovery and prevention and unfamiliarity with related resources. Current research shows that interdisciplinary interventions focusing on patient experience and patient education enable health-care providers to activate and empower patients, potentially leading to better clinical outcomes. Tool kit approaches have been successfully used to aid patients through ongoing education after hospital discharge and to improve patient experience. In this article, we describe our efforts to iteratively develop and test personalized stroke management tool kits aimed at connecting stroke survivors and their caregivers to empowering resources, while soliciting feedback from patients and family members.

AB Background: There is growing interest in the use of rapid blood culture identification (BCID) in antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). Although many studies have looked at its clinical and economic utility, its comparative utility in gram-positive and gram-negative blood stream infections (BSIs) has not been as well characterized.; Methods: The study was a quasi-experimental retrospective study at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. All adult patients with positive blood cultures before BCID implementation (June 2015 to December 2015) and after BCID implementation (June 2016 to December 2016) were included. The outcomes of interest included time to first appropriate antibiotic escalation, time to first appropriate antibiotic de-escalation, time to organism identification, length of stay, infectious diseases consultation, discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality.; Results: In total, 203 patients were included in this study. There was a significant difference in the time to organism identification between the pre- and post-BCID cohorts (27.1 hours vs 3.3 hours, P < .0001). BCID did not significantly reduce the time to first appropriate antimicrobial escalation or de-escalation for either gram-positive BSIs (GP-BSIs) or gram-negative BSIs (GN-BSIs). Providers were more likely to escalate antimicrobial therapy in GP-BSIs after gram stain and more likely to de-escalate therapy in GN-BSIs after susceptibilities. Although there were no significant differences in changes in antimicrobial therapy for organism identification by BCID vs traditional methods, more than one-quarter of providers (28.1%) made changes after organism identification. There were no differences in hospital length of stay or in-hospital mortality comparing pre- vs post-BCID.; Conclusions: Although BCID significantly reduced the time to identification for both GP-BSIs and GN-BSIs, BCID did not reduce the time to first appropriate antimicrobial escalation and de-escalation.

AB Hospitalized older adults are at high risk for complications, leading to negative outcomes such as longer lengths of stay, hospital readmissions, and functional and cognitive decline. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) models are effective in mitigating these syndromes but are not widespread. Nurses with expertise in gerontology who can provide consultation and care coordination can improve care processes and clinical outcomes. This pilot study capitalized on the role of the geriatric nurse consultant (GNC) to develop, implement, and test the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a GNC-led CGA. Through repeated applications with hospitalized patients, this study demonstrated that GNCs could complete a CGA and identify clinically actionable findings. This study also uncovered clinical geriatric concerns that would not have otherwise been identified via traditional nursing assessments. The results highlight contribution of a GNC-led CGA as a mechanism to support care process improvements to address common geriatric concerns in the acute care setting.

Setting The Program for the Identification of "Actionable Atrial" Fibrillation Pharmacy initiative took place in 30 pharmacies in Alberta and Ontario, Canada. 1149 participants≥65 were screened for atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Method Retrospective, secondary analysis of data using participant case-report forms, pharmacy data, and pharmacy claims to describe pharmacy services received by participants post-screening. Main Outcome Measure Number and types of remunerated pharmacy services received by participants post-screening. Results A total of 535/1149 (46.6%) participants screened at their regular pharmacy were included in this analysis. Of these, 165 (30.8%) participants received 229 pharmacy services within 3months post-screening, including 146 medication reviews, 57 influenza vaccinations, and 21 pharmaceutical opinions. A median (interquartile range, IQR) of 6 (2-11) pharmacy services were delivered, and median (IQR) reimbursement was $187.50 ($67.50-$342.50). Conclusions Approximately one-third of participants received a pharmacy service within 3months post-screening. Relatively large numbers of annual and follow-up medication reviews were delivered despite low eligibility for annual-only reviews and despite many missed opportunities for pharmacy service provision in at-risk patients. In-pharmacy screening may facilitate provision of some services, namely medication reviews, by providing opportunities to identify patients at-risk.

AB A deeper understanding of melanoma biology has opened up new avenues for mechanistically informed therapies. However, data on the prevalence of druggable genetic lesions in melanoma are still conflicting and real-world performance data on high-throughput genetic profiling of melanoma cases using formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue with variable tumour cellularity and quality are lacking. We retrospectively analysed targeted next-generation sequencing data of 274 consecutive melanoma samples obtained for routine diagnostics between December 2013 and July 2017. Actionable mutations were detected in 197 cases (71.9%), of which activating BRAF (mostly p.V600E/K) and RAS (mostly p.Q61R/K) mutations occurred in 40.5% (n=111) and 30.3% (n=83) of cases, respectively. We identified driver mutations of the Triple-WT subgroup in 10.6% of cases (n=29; 10 with activating KIT mutations). Median turnaround time was 5 working days with no dropouts. Tumour cellularity ranged from 5% to 95% and successful sequencing was possible at DNA concentrations as low as 0.03ng/muL (median 10.58ng/muL; range 0.03-209.05ng/muL). Fast, quality-controlled high-throughput genetic profiling of FFPE melanoma samples is feasible and provides a landscape of genetic aberrations in melanoma that is currently relevant in clinical practice and approximates TCGA subtypes.

AB PURPOSE: Few and small studies have been reported about multigene testing usage by massively parallel sequencing in European cancer families. There is an open debate about what genes should be tested, and the actionability of some included genes is under research.; METHODS: We investigated a panel of 34 known high/moderate-risk cancer genes, including 16 related to breast or ovarian cancer (BC/OC) genes, and 63 candidate genes to BC/OC in 192 clinically suspicious of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) Spanish families without pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2).; RESULTS: We identified 16 patients who carried a high- or moderate-risk pathogenic variant in eight genes: 4 PALB2, 3 ATM, 2 RAD51D, 2 TP53, 2 APC, 1 BRIP1, 1 PTEN and 1 PMS2. These findings led to increased surveillance or prevention options in 12 patients and predictive testing in their family members. We detected 383 unique variants of uncertain significance in known cancer genes, of which 35 were prioritized in silico. Eighteen loss-of-function variants were detected in candidate BC/OC genes in 17 patients (1 BARD1, 1 ERCC3, 1 ERCC5, 2 FANCE, 1 FANCI, 2 FANCL, 1 FANCM, 1 MCPH1, 1 PPM1D, 2 RBBP8, 3 RECQL4 and 1 with SLX4 and XRCC2), three of which also carry pathogenic variants in known cancer genes.; CONCLUSIONS: Eight percent of the BRCA1/2 negative patients carry pathogenic variants in other actionable genes. The multigene panel usage improves the diagnostic yield in HBOC testing and it is an effective tool to identify potentially new candidate genes.

AB Providing a fast and accurate diagnosis of acute large-vessel occlusion on computed tomography angiograms (CTAs) is essential for timely intervention and good stroke outcomes. However, the detection and appropriate management of incidental findings are also important parts of any clinical radiology practice and can greatly affect patient care. The intricate anatomy covered by CTAs of the head and neck coupled with the time pressures of acute stroke diagnosis creates an environment in which unrelated, important findings can potentially be missed. The purpose of our study was to document clinically actionable incidental findings on CTA in 225 patients undergoing acute stroke intervention. After institutional review board approval, a retrospective six-year review of CTAs of the head and neck in patients undergoing acute stroke intervention was performed for actionable incidental vascular and nonvascular findings. A total of 225 patients undergoing acute stroke intervention with documented intracranial large-vessel occlusion on CTAs were consecutively enrolled in the study. Incidental vascular findings were identified in 17 of 225 patients (7.5%, 95% confidence interval 5% to 12%). Previously unreported aneurysms ranging from 2mm to 10mm in size represented 18 of 19 vascular findings in these patients. Incidental nonvascular findings were identified in 32 patients (14%, 95% confidence interval 5% to 12%). These included malpositioned support lines and tubes; pneumothorax; interstitial lung disease; newly diagnosed metastatic disease; nasopharyngeal, parotid, and pituitary masses; and cervical spine compression fractures. CTAs of the head and neck in patients undergoing acute stroke intervention contain a relatively high frequency of vascular and nonvascular incidental findings requiring further follow-up, and therefore should be evaluated carefully and systematically.

AB Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) is a cost-effective molecular cytogenetic technique that has been used as a first-line diagnostic test in neurodevelopmental disorders in the USA since 2011. The impact of CMA results on clinical practice in China is not yet well studied, so we aimed to better evaluate this phenomenon. We analyzed the CMA results from 434 patients in our clinic, and characterized their molecular diagnoses, clinical features, and follow-up clinical actions based on these results. The overall diagnostic yield for our patients was 13.6% (59 out of 434). This gave a detection rate of 14.7% for developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 38/259) and 12% for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs, 21/175). Thirty-three recurrent (n≥2) variants were found, distributed at six chromosomal loci involving known chromosome syndromes (such as DiGeorge, Williams Beuren, and Angelman/Prader-Willi syndromes). The spectrum of positive copy number variants in our study was comparable to that reported in Caucasian populations, but with specific characteristics. Parental origin tests indicated an effect involving a significant maternal transmission bias to sons. The majority of patients with positive results (94.9%) had benefits, allowing earlier diagnosis (36/59), prioritized full clinical management (28/59), medication changes (7/59), a changed prognosis (30/59), and prenatal genetic counseling (15/59). Our results provide information on de novo mutations in Chinese children with DD/ID and/or ASDs. Our data showed that microarray testing provides immediate clinical utility for patients. It is expected that the personalized medical care of children with developmental disabilities will lead to improved outcomes in long-term developmental potential. We advocate using the diagnostic yield of clinically actionable results to evaluate CMA as it provides information of both clinical validity and clinical utility.

AB BACKGROUND: The increasing use of social media and mHealth apps has generated new opportunities for health care consumers to share information about their health and well-being. Information shared through social media contains not only medical information but also valuable information about how the survivors manage disease and recovery in the context of daily life.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of acquiring and modeling the topics of a major online breast cancer support forum. Breast cancer patient support forums were selected to discover the hidden, less obvious aspects of disease management and recovery.; METHODS: First, manual topic categorization was performed using qualitative content analysis (QCA) of each individual forum board. Second, we requested permission from the Breastcancer.org Community for a more in-depth analysis of the postings. Topic modeling was then performed using open source software Machine Learning Language Toolkit, followed by multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis to detect highly correlated topics among the different website forums.; RESULTS: QCA of the forums resulted in 20 categories of user discussion. The final topic model organized >4 million postings into 30 manageable topics. Using qualitative analysis of the topic models and statistical analysis, we grouped these 30 topics into 4 distinct clusters with similarity scores of ≥0.80; these clusters were labeled Symptoms & Diagnosis, Treatment, Financial, and Family & Friends. A clinician review confirmed the clinical significance of the topic clusters, allowing for future detection of actionable items within social media postings. To identify the most significant topics across individual forums, MLR demonstrated that 6 topics-based on the Akaike information criterion values ranging from -642.75 to -412.32-were statistically significant.; CONCLUSIONS: The developed method provides an insight into the areas of interest and concern, including those not ascertainable in the clinic. Such topics included support from lay and professional caregivers and late side effects of therapy that consumers discuss in social media and may be of interest to clinicians. The developed methods and results indicate the potential of social media to inform the clinical workflow with regards to the impact of recovery on daily life. ©Josette Jones, Meeta Pradhan, Masoud Hosseini, Anand Kulanthaivel, Mahmood Hosseini.

AB BACKGROUND: The spectrum of somatic single-nucleotide variants in cancer genomes often reflects the signatures of multiple distinct mutational processes, which can provide clinically actionable insights into cancer etiology. Existing software tools for identifying and evaluating these mutational signatures do not scale to analyze large datasets containing thousands of individuals or millions of variants.; RESULTS: We introduce Helmsman, a program designed to perform mutation signature analysis on arbitrarily large sequencing datasets. Helmsman is up to 300 times faster than existing software. Helmsman's memory usage is independent of the number of variants, resulting in a small enough memory footprint to analyze datasets that would otherwise exceed the memory limitations of other programs.; CONCLUSIONS: Helmsman is a computationally efficient tool that enables users to evaluate mutational signatures in massive sequencing datasets that are otherwise intractable with existing software. Helmsman is freely available at https://github.com/carjed/helmsman .

AB In a time where "translational" science has become a mantra in the biomedical field, it is reassuring when years of research into a biological phenomenon suddenly points towards novel prevention or therapeutic approaches to disease, thereby demonstrating once again that basic science and translational science are intimately linked. The studies on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) discussed here provide a perfect example of how years of basic toxicological research on a molecule, whose normal physiological function remained a mystery for so long, has now yielded a treasure trove of actionable information on the development of targeted therapeutics. Examples are autoimmunity, metabolic imbalance, inflammatory skin and gastro-intestinal diseases, cancer, development and perhaps ageing. Indeed, the AHR field no longer asks, "What does this receptor do in the absence of xenobiotics?" It now asks, "What doesn't this receptor do?".

AB In contrast to other countries with predominantly white populations, Russian smoking-related lung cancers (LC) are mainly squamous cell carcinomas and approximately half lung adenocarcinomas (AdCa) are not related to tobacco consumption. Given that smoking significantly influences the probability of presence of actionable mutations in LC, one would expect that Russian lung AdCa patients would differ from other white populations in distribution of EGFR, ALK, KRAS and BRAF mutations. Herein, 2,336 consecutive lung AdCa cases, including 1,203 patients with known smoking status, were subjected to sequential testing for the above mutations. One quarter of lung AdCa patients carried either EGFR or ALK mutation with combined prevalence of 42% in those who had never smoked but only 8% in smokers. There was only a moderate difference in KRAS mutation frequency between ever- and never-smokers in EGFR/ALK-negative cases (31% vs. 23%), and this was mainly attributed to increased prevalence of G12C substitution in the former group. The occurrence of BRAF V600E mutation was 1.7% and 4% in EGFR/ALK/KRAS mutation-negative ever- and never-smokers, respectively. ALK testing of 470 EGFR-mutated tumors revealed only 1 (0.2%) instance of translocation. Similarly, KRAS testing identified 1 (1.25%) mutation in 80 EGFR-mutated AdCa and none in 48 ALK-rearranged AdCa. Therefore, concurrent actionable mutations in lung adenocarcinoma are exceptionally rare and sequential gene testing can be regarded as a reliable option.

AB Compared to other breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) usually affects younger patients, is larger in size, of higher grade and is biologically more aggressive. To date, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the only available treatment for TNBC because it lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and no alternative targetable molecules have been identified so far. The high biological and clinical heterogeneity adds a further challenge to TNBC management and requires the identification of new biomarkers to improve detection by imaging, thus allowing the specific treatment of each individual TNBC subtype. The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) technique holds great promise to the search for novel targetable biomarkers, and aptamer-based molecular approaches have the potential to overcome obstacles of current imaging and therapy modalities. In this review, we highlight recent advances in oligonucleotide aptamers used as imaging and/or therapeutic agents in TNBC, discussing the potential options to discover, image and hit new actionable targets in TNBC.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bladder cancer (BCa) management had remained unchanged for 20+ years with clinicians, in contrast to many other cancer types, rarely relying on molecular characteristics to guide management. The past 5years have yielded significant advances in our knowledge of the molecular basis of BCa and concurrent advances in systemic therapy. We aim to highlight the key developments and potential future direction of BCa management.; RECENT FINDINGS: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has drastically altered the understanding of muscle-invasive BCa (MIBC) and non-muscle invasive BCa (NMIBC). MIBC molecular subtyping efforts from several groups worldwide grouped into an international consortium into five classes, broadly grouped into basal and luminal subtypes, have attempted to improve prediction of clinical outcomes and treatment response, either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. NMIBC molecular subtyping is yielding similar disease stratification, superior to histopathology alone. Additionally, with new actionable targets being identified for patients non-responsive to traditional therapy, ongoing and upcoming clinical trials are increasingly emphasizing the importance of the molecular testing. The molecular characterization of bladder cancer is rapidly progressing and will likely alter treatment paradigms in the near future.

AB The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has created a dysglycemia-based chronic disease (DBCD) multimorbidity care model consisting of four distinct stages along the insulin resistance-prediabetes-type 2 diabetes (T2D) spectrum that are actionable in a preventive care paradigm to reduce the potential impact of T2D, cardiometabolic risk, and cardiovascular events. The controversy of whether there is value, cost-effectiveness, or clinical benefit of diagnosing and/or managing the prediabetes state is resolved by regarding the problem, not in isolation, but as an intermediate stage in the continuum of a progressive chronic disease with opportunities for multiple concurrent prevention strategies. In this context, stage 1 represents "insulin resistance," stage 2 "prediabetes," stage 3 "type 2 diabetes," and stage 4 "vascular complications." This model encourages earliest intervention focusing on structured lifestyle change. Further scientific research may eventually reclassify stage 2 DBCD prediabetes from a predisease to a true disease state. This position statement is consistent with a portfolio of AACE endocrine disease care models, including adiposity-based chronic disease, that prioritize patient-centered care, evidence-based medicine, complexity, multimorbid chronic disease, the current health care environment, and a societal mandate for a higher value attributed to good health. Ultimately, transformative changes in diagnostic coding and reimbursement structures for prediabetes and T2D can provide improvements in population-based endocrine health care. Abbreviations: A1C = hemoglobin A1c; AACE = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists; ABCD = adiposity-based chronic disease; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DBCD = dysglycemia-based chronic disease; FPG = fasting plasma glucose; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide-1; MetS = metabolic syndrome; T2D = type 2 diabetes.

AB To address the demands of worldwide demographic and epidemiologic changes and globalization, as well as their effects on population health, the Ministry of Health in Oman developed a long-term plan for its health system called Health Vision 2050. The plan was shaped by international consultants, who sought to augment the vision with up-to-date evidence and achieve alignment with international standards. The Health Vision 2050 main document was anchored by 24 separate strategic studies covering different dimensions and pillars of the health system, one of which was the strategic study of medical equipment and healthcare technology (MEHT). This study analyzed the current status of MEHT, highlighted the achievements and bottlenecks, anticipated future challenges, and determined the future vision through pragmatic, contextualized, and actionable objectives and strategies that will provide a platform for comprehensive MEHT planning. Of note, pharmacological technologies, pharmaceutical drugs, and information technology have not been covered under the scope of this vision. By shedding light on this important strategic study about MEHT, the aim of this article is to assist other countries that are seeking to improve their MEHT based on the latest international guidelines and standards.

AB In ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd [2017] SGCA 20 and Shaw v Kovak [2017] EWCA Civ 1028, the idea that 'lost autonomy' should be recognised as a new form of actionable damage in the tort of negligence was rejected in Singapore and England, respectively. This, it will be argued, was the correct outcome. Protecting an interest in autonomy via the tort of negligence would undermine the coherence of that tort. In ACB, however, a new, different, form of damage was recognised: loss of 'genetic affinity'. This commentary will discuss some problems that protecting an interest in 'genetic affinity' raises before critiquing the approach to assessing damages in ACB.

AB The causal inference framework and related methods have emerged as vital within epidemiology. Scientists in many fields have found that this framework and a variety of designs and analytic approaches facilitate the conduct of strong science. These approaches have proven particularly important for catalyzing knowledge development using existing data and addressing questions for which randomized clinical trials are neither feasible nor ethical. The study of healthy women and normal childbearing processes may benefit from more direct and deliberate engagement with the process of inferring causes and, further, may be strengthened through use of methods appropriate for this undertaking. The purpose of this primer, the first in a series of 3 articles, is to provide the reader an introduction to concepts and methods relevant for causal inference, aimed at the clinician scientist and offer details and references supporting further application of epidemiologic knowledge. The causal inference framework and associated methods hold promise for generating strong, broadly representative, and actionable science to improve the outcomes of healthy women during the childbearing cycle and their children. © 2018 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB BACKGROUND: In pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), patient management decisions are sometimes based on preliminary interpretations of radiographs by pediatric intensivists (PIs) before a formal interpretation by a pediatric radiologist (PR).; OBJECTIVE: To quantify and classify discrepancies in radiographic interpretation between PRs and PIs in the PICU and NICU.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board-approved multi-institutional prospective study included three PRs and PIs at two PICUs and three NICUs. Interpretations of chest and abdominal radiographs by PIs and PRs were recorded on online forms and compared. Discrepancies in interpretations were classified as "miss," "misinterpretation," or "overcall." The discrepancies were also categorized as "actionable" or "nonactionable" based on extrapolation of the ACR actionable reporting work group's list of actionable findings.; RESULTS: In 960 radiographic interpretations, the total, nonactionable, and actionable discrepancy rates between PRs and PIs were 34.7%, 26.8%, and 7.9%, respectively. The most common actionable discrepancies were line or tube positions and identification and interpretation of parenchymal opacities in the lungs. Identification of air leaks in the PICU and differentiation of normal from abnormal bowel gas patterns in the NICU followed in frequency. Air leaks accounted for 1% of total discrepancies and 11% of actionable discrepancies. Most discrepancies were nonactionable and included retrocardiac atelectasis and mischaracterization of neonatal lung disease in the PICU and NICU, respectively.; CONCLUSION: Although the total discrepancy rate was high, most discrepancies were nonactionable. Actionable discrepancies were predominantly due to line and tube position, which should be an area of focused education. Copyright © 2017 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Synchronous multiple primary malignant tumors (MPMTs) are rare in young adults. Genomic profiling of synchronous MPMTs has not been systematically investigated to elucidate their genetic associations, but may be important to assist diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment strategy. In the present study, mutation profiling was performed using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) on 416 cancer-related genes in synchronous triple primary tumors of the lung, kidney and thyroid in a 32-year-old female patient. The patient was diagnosed with moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (T2aN0M0; stage IB), renal clear cell carcinoma (T1aN0M0; stage I), and thyroid papillary carcinoma (T1N1aM0, stage III) by pathological assessments. Clinically actionable mutations in EGFR and BRAF genes were identified in the lung and the thyroid lesions, respectively. Three tumors demonstrated distinct genomic profiles, suggesting that all tumors were independent primary tumors, which was consistent with histopathological assessment. Three potential germline cancer susceptibility mutations were shared between this patient and her father who was diagnosed with lung cancer. The present results demonstrated that, in the context of identical germline background and environmental exposure, multiple synchronous tumors in the same patient may have distinct mutation profiles and can be driven by distinct molecular events. Combination therapies may need to be considered during treatment decision-making.

AB The survival rate of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) remains about 7% to 14%. The natural killer (NK) cells are a critical component of antitumor immunity, and their composition and function in thyroid cancer patients are investigated in this study. In healthy controls and early stage thyroid cancer patients, >90% of circulating NK cells were CD56loCD16hi and fewer than 10% were CD56hiCD16hi/lo. However, the frequency of the CD56hiCD16hi/lo NK subset was significantly higher in more advanced thyroid cancer patients and further increased in ATC patients. Two members of the inhibitory KIR family, CD158a and CD158b, was significantly higher in CD56hiCD16hi/lo NK cells than in CD56loCD16hi NK cells, while NKG2D, an activator of NK cells, was significantly lower in CD56hiCD16hi/lo NK cells than in CD56loCD16hi NK cells. We also found that the CD56hiCD16hi/lo NK cells presented higher PD-1, higher Tim-3, and lower cytotoxicity against the human ATC cell line CAL-62, than the CD56loCD16hi NK cells. The expression of exhaustion markers and reduction in cytotoxicity was further exacerbated in more advanced thyroid cancer patients and in ATC patients. Interestingly, PD-1 and Tim-3 blockade was effective at reinvigorating both the more impaired CD56hiCD16hi/lo NK cells and the less impaired CD56loCD16hi NK cells from ATC patients. Together, our study identified a dysfunction of NK cells in more advanced thyroid cancer patients and ATC patients, and presented actionable targets for future development of immunotherapies in thyroid cancers.

AB For numerous countries, including Canada, regular health system performance reporting has become increasingly routine if not mandated by legislation. In Canada, the health system performance reporting agenda includes multiple players at all levels from national organizations to provincial health (quality) councils and others. Canada, like many other countries, also participates in international health system performance reporting initiatives. Making sense of what all of these reporting initiatives are telling us about health system performance both within Canada and compared to other countries is becoming increasingly more challenging. For almost 20 years, the Canadian Institute for Health Information has worked with provinces, territories, and other key partners to develop comparable, standardized pan-Canadian performance indicators. Throughout this process, many lessons have been identified including the actionability one can reasonably expect from public reporting initiatives. This article outlines some of the key aspects of these lessons.

AB PURPOSE: Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers an unbiased and noninvasive way to assess the genetic profiles of tumors. This study aimed to analyze mutations in ctDNA and their correlation with tissue mutations in patients with a variety of cancers.; METHODS: We included 21 cancer patients treated with surgical resection for whom we collected paired tissue and plasma samples. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of all exons was performed in a targeted human comprehensive cancer panel consisting of 275 genes.; RESULTS: Six patients had at least one mutation that was concordant between tissue and ctDNA sequencing. Among all mutations (n=35) detected by tissue and blood sequencing, 20% (n=7) were concordant at the gene level. Tissue and ctDNA sequencing identified driver mutations in 66.67% and 47.62% of the tested samples, respectively. Tissue and ctDNA NGS detected actionable alterations in 57.14% and 33.33% of patients, respectively. When somatic alterations identified by each test were combined, the total proportion of patients with actionable mutations increased to 71.43%. Moreover, variants of unknown significance that were judged likely pathogenic had a higher percentage in ctDNA exclusively. Across six representative genes (PIK3CA, CTNNB1, AKT1, KRAS, TP53, and MET), the sensitivity and specificity of detection using mutations in tissue sample as a reference were 25 and 96.74%, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that tissue NGS and ctDNA NGS are complementary rather than exclusive approaches; these data support the idea that ctDNA is a promising tool to interrogate cancer genetics.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to evaluate whether the use of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the first-line anatomical test in patients with suspected significant coronary artery disease (CAD) may reduce the number of coronary invasive angiographies (ICA), and expand the use of CCTA in patients currently diagnosed invasively.; METHODS: 120 patients (age:60.6 ± 7.9 years, 35% female) with indications to ICA were randomized 1:1 to undergo CCTA versus direct ICA. Outcomes were evaluated during the diagnostic and therapeutic periods.; RESULTS: The number of invasively examined patients was reduced by 64.4% in the CCTA group as compared to the direct ICA group (21vs59,p < 0.0001). The number of patients with ICAs not followed by coronary intervention was reduced by 88.1% with the CCTA strategy (5vs42,p < 0.0001). Over the diagnostic and therapeutic course there were no significant differences regarding the median volume of contrast (CCTA 80.3 ml[65.0-165.0] vs ICA 90.0 ml[55.0-100.0], p = 0.099), while a non-significant trend towards higher radiation dose in the CCTA group was observed (9.9 mSv[7.0-22.1] vs 9.4 mSv[5.2-14.0], p = 0.05). There were no acute cardiovascular events.; CONCLUSIONS: CCTA may hypothetically act as an effective 'gatekeeper' to the catheterization laboratory in the diagnosis of stable patients with current indications for ICA. This strategy may result in non-invasive, outpatient-based triage of two thirds of individuals without actionable CAD, obviating unnecessary invasive examinations. However, the longer follow-up is indispensable. CLINICALTRIALS.; GOV NUMBER: NCT02591992. Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Several biobanks have begun returning genetic results to individuals, making the development of public genetic literacy an urgent task for their effective use. No research exists regarding the effects of genetic education on biobank participants, so we conducted genetics workshops with specialists, and surveyed differences in the participants' (n=112) preferences to receive their own genetic information by disease categories and their genetic knowledge using questionnaires before and after the workshops. Almost 90% of our participants were over 60 years old, which was similar to our previous preference research. The preference to receive five of the six categories of genetic information (lifestyle diseases, pharmacogenetics, adult-onset non-clinically actionable diseases, non-clinically actionable multifactorial diseases, and all genetic information) was slightly but significantly decreased after the genetics workshop. More participants preferred to receive genetic results regarding lifestyle diseases, pharmacogenetics, and adult-onset clinically actionable diseases after the workshop, while less participants preferred to receive information regarding adult-onset non-clinically actionable diseases, non-clinically actionable multifactorial diseases, and all genetic information. Total genetic knowledge scores significantly increased after the workshop (before: 11.89, after: 13.30, p<0.001). Our findings suggest that genetics workshops are useful to improve the genetic literacy of genome cohort participants.

AB BACKGROUND: The hybrid operating room (OR) offers new opportunities for the management of complex cerebrovascular lesions to the dual-trained neurovascular surgeon. It creates a space for easy accessibility to perform complex endovascular procedures by delivering high-quality images with readily available surgical equipment.; CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we demonstrate how the hybrid OR allowed for rapid identification and near zero-delay distal mechanical thrombectomy of a middle cerebral artery occlusion with favorable outcome after clipping of a complex posterior communicating artery aneurysm.; CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cerebral angiography after open surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms gives real-time actionable data that can affect intraoperative decision making. This can be accomplished without a hybrid OR by using fluoroscopic equipment, but suboptimal imaging conditions may lead to unfavorable outcomes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Research demonstrates that the majority of alarms derived from continuous bedside monitoring devices are non-actionable. This avalanche of unreliable alerts causes clinicians to experience sensory overload when attempting to sort real from false alarms, causing desensitization and alarm fatigue, which in turn leads to adverse events when true instability is neither recognized nor attended to despite the alarm. The scope of the problem of alarm fatigue is broad, and its contributing mechanisms are numerous. Current and future approaches to defining and reacting to actionable and non-actionable alarms are being developed and investigated, but challenges in impacting alarm modalities, sensitivity and specificity, and clinical activity in order to reduce alarm fatigue and adverse events remain. A multi-faceted approach involving clinicians, computer scientists, industry, and regulatory agencies is needed to battle alarm fatigue. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Diagnosis of life-threatening deep-seated infections currently requires invasive sampling of the infected tissue to provide a microbiologic diagnosis. These procedures can lead to high morbidity in patients and add to healthcare costs. Here we describe a novel next-generation sequencing assay that was used to detect pathogen-derived cell-free DNA in peripheral blood of patients with biopsy-proven invasive fungal infections. The noninvasive nature of this approach could provide rapid, actionable treatment information for invasive fungal infections when a biopsy is not possible. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB Wearable physiological status monitoring is part of modern precision medicine that permits predictions about an individual's health and performance from their real-time physiological status (RT-PSM) instead of relying on population-based predictions informed by estimated human, mission, and environmental/ambient conditions. RT-PSM systems have useful military applications if they are soldier-acceptable and provide important actionable information. Most commercially available systems do not address relevant military needs, typically lack the validated algorithms that make real time computed information useful, and are not open architected to be integrated with the soldier technological ecology. Military RT-PSM development requires committed investments in iterative efforts involving physiologists, biomedical engineers, and the soldier users. Military operational applications include: (1) technological enhancement of performance by providing individual status information to optimize self-regulation, workload distribution, and enhanced team sensing/situational awareness; (2) detection of impending soldier failure from stress load (physical, psychological, and environmental); (3) earliest possible detection of threat agent exposure that includes the "human sensor"; (4) casualty detection, triage, and early clinical management; (5) optimization of individual health and fitness readiness habits; and (6) long term health risk-associated exposure monitoring and dosimetry. This paper is focused on the performance-related applications and considers near term predictions such as thermal-work limits, alertness and fitness for duty status, musculoskeletal fatigue limits, neuropsychological status, and mission-specific physiological status. Each new measurement capability has provided insights into soldier physiology and advances the cycle of invention, lab and field testing, new discovery and redesign. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recently in Shaw v Kovac, the Court of Appeal seemed to have rejected a standalone injury to autonomy (ITA) as actionable in negligence, in an informed consent case. In this article, I argue that Shaw can be explained away, and that English law recognizes ITA as actionable in a series of cases, some of which-Bhamra, Tracey, and Yearworth-were not hitherto understood to do so. However, the under-theorization in the cases leads to inconsistencies. Like cases (Rees/Yearworth; Chester/Tracey) are not treated alike; ITA is misunderstood to be about 'religious offence' (Bhamra) and property loss (Yearworth) and worse still, the more serious type 2 ITA (Rees) gives rise to a weaker remedy (of exceptional nature aside) than the less serious type 1 injury (Chester). A better understanding of the different manifestations of ITA will lead to results which are both more consistent and more justified on the merit.

AB INTRODUCTION: Patient safety culture (PSC) is an emerging construct in adult long-term care settings. No measures are validated to quantify PSC in pediatric long-term care (pLTC) settings despite the importance of safety for this vulnerable population. The study purposes are to (1) describe PSC in pLTC, (2) assess the relationship of PSC to facility recommendation and overall safety rating, and (3) test the stability and reliability of the PSC survey over time.; METHODS: A modified Nursing Home PSC (NHSPSC) survey was administered to employees at three pLTC facilities over 3 years; data were summarized and compared over time.; RESULTS: In all, 208 surveys were completed. Staff perceptions on "feedback and communication about incidents" and "overall perceptions of resident safety" were most positive and associated with responses of recommending the facility and high overall ratings for child safety (p < .05).; CONCLUSIONS: The modified NHSPSC survey was reliable by Cronbach alpha and findings were consistent over time in these pLTC settings. This tool may be a useful adjunct to safety initiatives in pLTC. Knowledge derived from this survey can provide actionable information for consumers, pLTC employees, managers, and administrators.

AB Despite a newfound wealth of data and information, the healthcare sector is lacking in actionable knowledge. This is largely because healthcare data, though plentiful, tends to be inherently complex and fragmented. Health data analytics, with an emphasis on predictive analytics, is emerging as a transformative tool that can enable more proactive and preventative treatment options. This review considers the ways in which predictive analytics has been applied in the for-profit business sector to generate well-timed and accurate predictions of key outcomes, with a focus on key features that may be applicable to healthcare-specific applications. Published medical research presenting assessments of predictive analytics technology in medical applications are reviewed, with particular emphasis on how hospitals have integrated predictive analytics into their day-to-day healthcare services to improve quality of care. This review also highlights the numerous challenges of implementing predictive analytics in healthcare settings and concludes with a discussion of current efforts to implement healthcare data analytics in the developing country, Saudi Arabia.

AB In the middle of growing consensus that genomics researchers should offer to return clinically valid, medically relevant, and medically actionable findings identified in the course of research, psychiatric genetics researchers face new challenges. As they uncover the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders through genome-wide association studies and integrate whole genome and whole exome sequencing to their research, there is a pressing need for examining these researchers' views regarding the return of results (RoR) and the unique challenges for offering RoR from psychiatric genetics research. Based on qualitative interviews with 39 psychiatric genetics researchers from different countries operating at the forefront of their field, we provide an insider's view of researchers' practices regarding RoR and the most contentious issues in psychiatry researchers' decision-making around RoR, including what are the strongest ethical, scientific, and practical arguments for and against offering RoR from this research. Notably, findings suggest that psychiatric genetics researchers (85%) overwhelmingly favor offering RoR of at least some findings, but only 22% of researchers are returning results. Researchers identified a number of scientific and practical concerns about RoR, and about how to return results in a responsible way to patients diagnosed with a severe psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, findings help highlight areas for further discussion and resolution of conflicts in the practice of RoR in psychiatric genetics research. As the pace of discovery in psychiatric genetics continues to surge, resolution of these uncertainties gains greater urgency to avoid ethical pitfalls and to maximize the positive impact of RoR. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular surveillance and outbreak investigation are important for elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States. A web-based system, Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST), has been developed using Illumina MiSeq-based amplicon sequence data derived from the HCV E1/E2-junction genomic region to enable public health institutions to conduct cost-effective and accurate molecular surveillance, outbreak detection and strain characterization. However, as there are many factors that could impact input data quality to which the GHOST system is not completely immune, accuracy of epidemiological inferences generated by GHOST may be affected. Here, we analyze the data submitted to the GHOST system during its pilot phase to assess the nature of the data and to identify common quality concerns that can be detected and corrected automatically.; RESULTS: The GHOST quality control filters were individually examined, and quality failure rates were measured for all samples, including negative controls. New filters were developed and introduced to detect primer dimers, loss of specimen-specific product, or short products. The genotyping tool was adjusted to improve the accuracy of subtype calls. The identification of "chordless" cycles in a transmission network from data generated with known laboratory-based quality concerns allowed for further improvement of transmission detection by GHOST in surveillance settings. Parameters derived to detect actionable common quality control anomalies were incorporated into the automatic quality control module that rejects data depending on the magnitude of a quality problem, and warns and guides users in performing correctional actions. The guiding responses generated by the system are tailored to the GHOST laboratory protocol.; CONCLUSIONS: Several new quality control problems were identified in MiSeq data submitted to GHOST and used to improve protection of the system from erroneous data and users from erroneous inferences. The GHOST system was upgraded to include identification of causes of erroneous data and recommendation of corrective actions to laboratory users.

AB BACKGROUND: Knowledge syntheses that use a realist methodology are gaining popularity. Yet, there are few reports in the literature that describe how results are summarised, shared and used. This paper aims to inform knowledge translation (KT) for realist reviews by describing the process of developing a KT strategy for a review on pathways for scaling up complex public health interventions.; METHODS: The participatory approach used for the realist review was also used to develop the KT strategy. The approach included three main steps, namely (1) an international meeting focused on interpreting preliminary findings from the realist review and seeking input on KT activities; (2) a targeted literature review on KT for realist reviews; and (3) consultations with primary knowledge users of the review.; RESULTS: The international meeting identified a general preference among knowledge users for findings from the review that are action oriented. A need was also identified for understanding how to tailor findings for specific knowledge user groups in relation to their needs. The literature review identified four papers that included brief descriptions of planned or actual KT activities for specific research studies; however, information was minimal on what KT activities or products work for whom, under what conditions and why. The consultations revealed that KT for realist reviews should consider the following: (1) activities closely aligned with the preferences of specific knowledge user groups; (2) key findings that are sensitive to factors within the knowledge user's context; and (3) actionable statements that can advance KT goals, activities or products. The KT strategy derived from the three activities includes a planning framework and tailored KT activities that address preferences of knowledge users for findings that are action oriented and context relevant.; CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides an example of a KT strategy for realist reviews that blends theoretical and practical insights. Evaluation of the strategy's implementation will provide useful insights on its effectiveness and potential for broader application.

AB BACKGROUND: Capturing and Analyzing Sensor and Self-Report Data for Clinicians and Researchers (COMPASS) is an electronic health (eHealth) platform designed to improve cancer care delivery through passive monitoring of patients' health status and delivering customizable reports to clinicians. Based on data from sensors and context-driven administration of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, key indices of patients' functional status can be collected between regular clinic visits, supporting clinicians in the delivery of patient care.; OBJECTIVE: The first phase of this project aimed to systematically collect input from oncology providers and patients on potential clinical applications for COMPASS to refine the system.; METHODS: Ten clinicians representing various oncology specialties and disciplines completed semi-structured interviews designed to solicit clinician input on how COMPASS can best support clinical care delivery. Three cancer patients tested a prototype of COMPASS for 7 days and provided feedback. Interview data were tabulated using thematic content analysis to identify the most clinically relevant objective and PRO domains.; RESULTS: Thematic content analysis revealed that clinicians were most interested in monitoring vital statistics, symptoms, and functional status, including the physical activity level (n=9), weight (n=5), fatigue (n=9), sleep quality (n=8), and anxiety (n=7). Patients (2 in active treatment and 1 in remission) reported that they would use such a device, were enthusiastic about their clinicians monitoring their health status, especially the tracking of symptoms, and felt knowing their clinicians were monitoring and reviewing their health status provided valuable reassurance. Patients would, however, like to provide some context to their data.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and patients both articulated potential benefits of the COMPASS system in improving cancer care. From a clinician standpoint, data need to be easily interpretable and actionable. The fact that patients and clinicians both see potential value in eHealth systems suggests wider adoption and utilization could prove to be a useful tool for improving care delivery. ©Alexander R Lucas, Michael B Bass, Nan E Rothrock, Mary L O'Connor, Mia R Sorkin, Jason Nawyn, Fahd Albinali, Lynne I Wagner.

AB BACKGROUND: Multifaceted interventions driven by the needs of patients and providers can help move evidence into practice more rapidly. This study engaged both patients and primary care providers (PCPs) to help design novel opinion leader (OL)-based interventions for patients with acute asthma seen in emergency departments (EDs).; METHODS: A mixed methods design was employed. In phase I, we invited convenience samples of patients with asthma presenting to the ED and PCPs to participate in a survey. Perceptions with respect to: a) an ideal OL-profile for asthma guidance; and b) content, style and delivery methods of OL-based interventions in acute asthma directed from the ED were collected. In phase II, we conducted focus groups to further explore preferences and expectations for such interventions with attention to barriers and facilitators for implementation.; RESULTS: Overall, 54 patients completed the survey; 39% preferred receiving guidance from a respirologist, 44% during their ED visit and 56% through individual discussions. In addition, 55% expressed interest in having PCP follow-up within a week of ED discharge. A respirologist was identified as the ideal OL-profile by 59% of the 39 responding PCPs. All expressed interest in receiving notification of their patients' ED presentation, most within a week and including diagnosis and ED/post ED-treatment. Personalized, guideline-based, recommendations were considered to be the ideal content by the majority; 39% requested this guidance through a pamphlet faxed to their offices. In the focus groups, patients and PCPs recognized the importance of health professional liaisons in transitions in care; patient anxiety and PCP time constraints were identified as potential barriers for ED-educational information uptake and proper post-ED follow-up, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Engaging patients and PCPs yielded actionable information to tailor OL-based multifaceted interventions for acute asthma in the ED. We identified potential facilitators for the implementation of such interventions (e.g., patient interaction with alternative health care professionals who could facilitate transitions in asthma care between the ED and the primary care setting), and for the provision of post discharge self-management education (e.g., consideration of the first week of ED discharge as a practical time frame for this intervention). Prioritization of identified barriers (e.g., lack of PCP involvement) could be addressed by the identification of potential early adopters in practice environments (e.g., clinicians with special interest in asthma).

AB PURPOSE: To determine the potential for detection of incidental germline cancer predisposition mutations through cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analyses in patients who underwent solid tumor somatic mutation evaluation.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were evaluated from 10,888 unselected patients with advanced (stage III/IV) cancer who underwent Guardant360 testing between November 2015 and December 2016. The main outcome was prevalence of putative germline mutations identified among 16 actionable hereditary cancer predisposition genes.; RESULTS: More than 50 cancer types were studied, including lung (41%), breast (19%), colorectal (8%), prostate (6%), pancreatic (3%), and ovarian (2%). Average patient age was 63.5 years (range, 18 to 95 years); 43% were male. One hundred and fifty-six individuals (1.4%) had suspected hereditary cancer mutations in 11 genes. Putative germline mutations were more frequent in individuals younger than 50 years versus those 50 years and older (3.0% v 1.2%, respectively; P < .001). Highest yields of putative germline findings were in patients with ovarian (8.13%), prostate (3.46%), pancreatic (3.34%), and breast (2.2%) cancer. Putative germline mutation identification was consistent among 12 individuals with multiple samples. Patients with circulating tumor DNA copy number variation and/or reversion mutations suggestive of functional loss of the wild-type allele in the tumor DNA also are described.; CONCLUSION: Detection of putative germline mutations from cfDNA is feasible across multiple genes and cancer types without prior mutation knowledge. Many mutations were found in cancers without clear guidelines for hereditary cancer genetic counseling/testing. Given the clinical significance of identifying hereditary cancer predisposition for patients and their families as well as targetable germline alterations such as in BRCA1 or BRCA2, research on the best way to validate and return potential germline results from cfDNA analysis to clinicians and patients is needed.

AB BACKGROUND: The cellular effects of androgen are transduced through the androgen receptor, which controls the expression of genes that regulate biosynthetic processes, cell growth, and metabolism. Androgen signaling also impacts DNA damage signaling through mechanisms involving gene expression and transcription-associated DNA damaging events. Defining the contributions of androgen signaling to DNA repair is important for understanding androgen receptor function, and it also has translational implications.; METHODS: We generated RNA-seq data from multiple prostate cancer lines and used bioinformatic analyses to characterize androgen-regulated gene expression. We compared the results from cell lines with gene expression data from prostate cancer xenografts, and patient samples, to query how androgen signaling and prostate cancer progression influences the expression of DNA repair genes. We performed whole genome sequencing to help characterize the status of the DNA repair machinery in widely used prostate cancer lines. Finally, we tested a DNA repair enzyme inhibitor for effects on androgen-dependent transcription.; RESULTS: Our data indicates that androgen signaling regulates a subset of DNA repair genes that are largely specific to the respective model system and disease state. We identified deleterious mutations in the DNA repair genes RAD50 and CHEK2. We found that inhibition of the DNA repair enzyme MRE11 with the small molecule mirin inhibits androgen-dependent transcription and growth of prostate cancer cells.; CONCLUSIONS: Our data supports the view that crosstalk between androgen signaling and DNA repair occurs at multiple levels, and that DNA repair enzymes in addition to PARPs, could be actionable targets in prostate cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer has numerous genomic features that are potentially actionable by targeted agents. Nevertheless, both pre-clinical and clinical research using molecular targeted agents have been very limited in bladder cancer.; RESULTS: We created the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Bladder Cancer (GDBC) database, an integrated database (DB) to facilitate the genomic understanding of bladder cancer in relation to drug sensitivity, in order to promote potential therapeutic applications of targeted agents in bladder cancer treatment. The GDBC database contains two separate datasets: 1) in-house drug sensitivity data, in which 13 targeted agents were tested against 10 bladder cancer cell lines; 2) data extracted and integrated from public databases, including the Cancer Therapeutics Research Portal, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and the Cancer Gene Census databases, as well as bladder cancer genomics data and synthetic lethality/synthetic dosage lethality connections.; CONCLUSIONS: GDBC is an integrated DB of genomics and drug sensitivity data with a specific focus on bladder cancer. With a user-friendly web-interface, GDBC helps users generate genomics-based hypotheses that can be tested experimentally using drugs and cell lines included in GDBC.

AB Advances in user interfaces, pattern recognition, and ubiquitous computing continue to pave the way for better navigation towards our health goals. Quantitative methods which can guide us towards our personal health goals will help us optimize our daily life actions, and environmental exposures. Ubiquitous computing is essential for monitoring these factors and actuating timely interventions in all relevant circumstances. We need to combine the events recognized by different ubiquitous systems and derive actionable causal relationships from an event ledger. Understanding of user habits and health should be teleported between applications rather than these systems working in silos, allowing systems to find the optimal guidance medium for required interventions. We propose a method through which applications and devices can enhance the user experience by leveraging event relationships, leading the way to more relevant, useful, and, most importantly, pleasurable health guidance experience.

AB The risk stratification of prostate cancer and breast cancer tumours from patients relies on histopathology, selective genomic testing, or on other methods employing fixed formalin tissue samples. However, static biomarker measurements from bulk fixed-tissue samples provide limited accuracy and actionability. Here, we report the development of a live-primary-cell phenotypic-biomarker assay with single-cell resolution, and its validation with prostate cancer and breast cancer tissue samples for the prediction of post-surgical adverse pathology. The assay includes a collagen-I/fibronectin extracellular-matrix formulation, dynamic live-cell biomarkers, a microfluidic device, machine-vision analysis and machine-learning algorithms, and generates predictive scores of adverse pathology at the time of surgery. Predictive scores for the risk stratification of 59 prostate cancer patients and 47 breast cancer patients, with values for area under the curve in receiver-operating-characteristic curves surpassing 80%, support the validation of the assay and its potential clinical applicability for the risk stratification of cancer patients.

AB The molecular pathways involved in the development and treatment of oesophageal cancer are complex. Recent large-scale genome sequencing studies have delivered novel insights into aetiology and possible targeted treatments. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and adenocarcinoma (OAC) are distinct entities. At the molecular level OSCC is more similar to squamous cell cancers in other organs than OAC. Whilst considerable heterogeneity exists in both tumour types new data suggests that driver gene events and mutational signatures may be able to categorise tumours into potentially actionable subtypes. Taken together these findings not only suggest new avenues for treatments in a cancer type with appalling outcomes, but also a new era of molecular rather than purely anatomical classification and staging of oesophageal cancer.

AB Background: Graduate medical education programs are expected to conduct an annual program evaluation. While general guidelines exist, innovative and feasible approaches to program evaluations may help efforts at program improvement. Appreciative Inquiry is an approach that focuses on successful moments, effective processes, and programs' strengths.; Objective: We implemented a novel application of Appreciative Inquiry and its 4 phases (Inquire, Imagine, Innovate, and Implement) and demonstrate how it led to meaningful improvements in a pediatric pulmonology fellowship program.; Methods: As part of the Inquire and Imagine phases, the authors developed an interview guide that aligned with Appreciative Inquiry concepts. Two faculty members conducted semistructured interviews with a convenience sample of 11 of 14 fellowship alumni. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and reviewed. A summary of the findings was presented to the Program Evaluation Committee, which then directed the Innovate and Implement phases.; Results: Appreciative Inquiry was acceptable to the alumni and feasible with the authors' self-directed learning approach and minimal administrative and financial support. In the Inquire phase, alumni identified program strengths and successes. In the Imagine phase, alumni identified program changes that could aid transition to independent practice for future fellows (an identified program goal). Based on the results of the Appreciative Inquiry, program leadership and the Program Evaluation Committee selected improvements for implementation.; Conclusions: For small programs, Appreciative Inquiry is an innovative and feasible approach to program evaluation that facilitates actionable program improvement recommendations.

AB PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of a CT temporal subtraction (TS) method on radiologists' performance in sclerotic metastasis detection in the thoracolumbar spine.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 pairs (current and previous CTs) of standard-dose CT and their TS images in patients with sclerotic bone metastasis and 20 pairs (current and previous CTs) of those in patients without bone metastasis were used for an observer performance study. A total of 135 lesions were identified as the reference standard of actionable lesions (sclerotic metastasis newly appeared or increased in size or in attenuation). 4 attending radiologists and 4 radiology residents participated in this observer study. Ratings and locations of "lesions" determined by the observers were utilized for assessing the statistical significance of differences between radiologists' performances without and with the CT-TS images in JAFROC analysis. The statistical significance of differences in the reviewing time was determined by a two-tailed paired t-test.; RESULTS: The average figure-of-merit (FOM) values for all but one radiologist increased to a statistically significant degree, from 0.856 without the CT-TS images to 0.884 with the images (P=.037). The average sensitivity for detecting the actionable lesions was improved from 60.7 % to 72.5% at a false-positive rate of 0.15 per case by use of the CT-TS images. The average reading time with CT-TS images was significantly shorter than that without (150.6s vs. 166.5s, P=.004).; CONCLUSION: The use of CT-TS would improve the observer performance for the detection of the sclerotic bone metastasis in the thoracolumbar spine.

AB OBJECTIVE: Multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) are an innovative class of products that deliver varied combinations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, other sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, and contraception. Combining separate strategies for different indications into singular prevention products can reduce the stigma around HIV and STI prevention, improve acceptability of and adherence to more convenient products, and be more cost-effective by addressing overlapping risks.; METHODS: This article outlines a strategic action framework developed as an outcome of a series of expert meetings held between 2014 and 2016. The meetings focused on identifying opportunities and challenges for MPTs that combine hormonal contraception (HC) with antiretroviral drugs into single products. The framework aims to present an actionable strategy, by addressing key research gaps and outlining the key areas for progress, to guide current and future HC MPT development.; RESULTS: We identified eight primary action areas for the development of impactful HC MPTs, and includes aspects from epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical trial design, regulatory requirements, manufacturing and commercialisation, behavioural science, and investment needs for research and development.; CONCLUSION: Overall, the challenges involved with reconciling the critical social-behavioural context that will drive MPT product use and uptake with the complexities of research and development and regulatory approval are of paramount importance. To realise the potential of MPTs given their complexity and finite resources, researchers in the MPT field must be strategic about the way forward; increased support among policy-makers, advocates, funders and the pharmaceutical industry is critical.

AB A rare case of benign peritoneal strumosis was screened for driver mutations in genes relevant to currently approved cancer therapies. Therefore, three formalin fixed paraffin embedded issue sections were screened with the GeneReader Actionable Insights NGS panel (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for the occurrence of driver mutations. Several mutations were identified in drug-targetable genes, such as ALK, EGFR, and BRAF. The majority of identified mutations were single nucleotide variant, but also a insertion/deletion mutation was identified. The presented dataset is the first NGS dataset available from a patient with benign peritoneal strumosis.

AB The clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for a diverse range of targets is expanding, increasing the need for multiplexed analysis of both DNA and RNA. However, translation into daily use requires a rigorous and comprehensive validation strategy. The aim of this clinical validation was to assess the performance of the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (IonPGM) and validate the Oncomine Focus DNA and RNA Fusion panels for clinical application in solid tumour testing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Using a mixture of routine FFPE and reference material across a variety of tissue and specimen types, we sequenced 86 and 31 samples on the Oncomine Focus DNA and RNA Fusion assays, respectively. This validation considered a number of parameters including the clinical robustness of the bioinformatics pipeline for variant detection and interpretation. The Oncomine Focus DNA assay had a sample and variant-based sensitivity of 99.1 and 97.1%, respectively, and an assay specificity of 100%. The Oncomine Focus Fusion panel had a good sensitivity and specificity based upon the samples assessed, however requires further validation to confirm findings due to limited sample numbers. We observed a good sequencing performance based upon amplicon, gene (hotspot variants within gene) and sample specific analysis with 92% of clinical samples obtaining an average amplicon coverage above 500X. Detection of some indels was challenging for the routine IonReporter workflow; however, the addition of NextGENe software improved indel identification demonstrating the importance of both bench and bioinformatic validation. With an increasing number of clinically actionable targets requiring a variety of methodologies, NGS provides a cost-effective and time-saving methodology to assess multiple targets across different modalities. We suggest the use of multiple analysis software to ensure identification of clinically applicable variants.

AB BACKGROUND: An estimated 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancers are due to hereditary causes such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Medicare, the third-party payer that covers 44 million patients in the United States, has implemented a set of clinical criteria to determine coverage for the testing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These criteria, developed to identify carriers of BRCA1/2 variants, have not been evaluated in the panel testing era. This study investigated a series of Medicare patients undergoing genetic testing for HBOC to determine the efficacy of genetic testing criteria in identifying patients with hereditary risk.; METHODS: This study retrospectively examined de-identified data from a consecutive series of Medicare patients undergoing genetic testing based on personal and family history of breast and gynecologic cancer. Ordering clinicians indicated whether patients did or did not meet established criteria for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. The genetic test results were compared between the group that met the criteria and the group that did not. Patients in families with known pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were excluded from the primary analysis.; RESULTS: Among 4196 unique Medicare patients, the rate of P/LP variants for the patients who met the criteria for genetic testing was 10.5%, and for those who did not, the rate was 9% (p=0.26).; CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that a substantial number of Medicare patients with clinically actionable genetic variants are being missed by current testing criteria and suggest the need for significant expansion and simplification of the testing criteria for HBOC.

AB The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) now defines excellent primary care. Recent literature has begun to elucidate the components of PCMHs that improve care and reduce costs, but there is little empiric evidence that helps practices, payers, or policy makers understand how high-performing practices have improved outcomes. We report the findings from 38 such practices that fill this gap. We describe how they execute 8 functions that collectively meet patient needs. They include managing populations, providing self-management support coaching, providing integrated behavioral health care, and managing referrals. The functions provide a more actionable perspective on the work of primary care.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine critical care nurses' knowledge of alarm fatigue and practices toward alarms in critical care settings.; RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey using an adaptation of The Health Technology Foundation Clinical Alarms Survey.; SETTING: A sample of critical care nurses (n = 250) from 10 departments across six hospitals in Ireland.; RESULTS: A response rate of 66% (n = 166) was achieved. All hospital sites reported patient adverse events related to clinical alarms. The majority of nurses (52%, n = 86) did not know or were unsure, how to prevent alarm fatigue. Most nurses (90%, n = 148) agreed that non-actionable alarms occurred frequently, disrupted patient care (91%, n = 145) and reduced trust in alarms prompting nurses to sometimes disable alarms (81%, n = 132). Nurses claiming to know how to prevent alarm fatigue stated they customised patient alarm parameters frequently (p = 0.037). Frequent false alarms causing reduced attention or response to alarms ranked the number one obstacle to effective alarm management; this was followed by inadequate staff to respond to alarms. Only 31% (n = 50) believed that alarm management policies and procedures were used effectively.; CONCLUSION: Alarm fatigue has the potential for serious consequences for patient safety and answering numerous alarms drains nursing resources.

AB BACKGROUND: Research findings should be disseminated appropriately to generate maximum impact. The development of research derived 'actionable' tools (RDAT) as research outputs may contribute to impact in health services and health systems research. However there is little agreement on what is meant by actionable tool or what can make them useful. We set out to develop a consensus definition of what is meant by a RDAT and to identify characteristics of a RDAT that would support its use across the research-practice boundary.; METHODS: A modified Delphi method was used with a panel of 33 experts comprising of researchers, research funders, policy makers and practitioners. Three rounds were administered including an initial workshop, followed by two online surveys comprising of Likert scales supplemented with open-ended questions. Consensus was defined at 75% agreement.; RESULTS: Consensus was reached for the definition and characteristics of RDATs, and on considerations that might maximize their use. The panel also agreed how RDATs could become integral to primary research methods, conduct and reporting. A typology of RDATs did not reach consensus.; CONCLUSIONS: A group of experts agreed a definition and characteristics of RDATs that are complementary to peer reviewed publications. The importance of end users shaping such tools was seen as of paramount importance. The findings have implications for research funders to resource such outputs in funding calls. The research community might consider developing and applying skills to coproduce RDATs with end users as part of the research process. Further research is needed on tracking the impact of RDATs, and defining a typology with a range of end-users.

AB Introduction: Hospital falls are a continuing clinical concern, with over one million falls occurring each year in the United States. Annually, hospital-acquired falls result in an estimated $34 billion in direct medical costs. Falls are considered largely preventable and, as a result, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have announced that fall-related injuries are no longer a reimbursable hospital cost. While policies and practices have been implemented to reduce falls, little sustained reduction has been achieved. Little empirical evidence supports the validity of published fall risk factors. While chart abstraction has been used to operationalize risk factors, few studies have examined registered nurses' (RNs') narrative notes as a source of actionable data. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to explore whether there is meaningful fall risk and prevention information in RNs' electronic narrative notes.; Methods: This study utilized a natural language processing design. Data for this study were extracted from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. The date comprises deidentified EHR data associated with patients who stayed in critical care units between 2001 and 2012. Text mining procedures were performed on RN's narrative notes following the traditional steps of knowledge discovery.; Results: The corpus of data extracted from MIMIC-III database was comprised of 1,046,053 RNs' notes from 36,583 unique patients. We identified 3,972 notes (0.4 percent) representing 1,789 (5 percent) patients with explicit documentation related to fall risk/prevention. Around 10 percent of the notes (103,685) from 23,025 patients mentioned intrinsic (patient-related) factors that have been theoretically associated with risk of falling. An additional 1,322 notes (0.1 percent) from 692 patients (2 percent) mentioned extrinsic risk factors, related to organizational design and environment. Moreover, 7672 notes (0.7 percent) from 2,571 patients (7 percent) included information on interventions that could theoretically impact patient falls.; Conclusions: This exploratory study using a NLP approach revealed that meaningful information related to fall risk and prevention may be found in RNs' narrative notes. In particular, RNs' notes can contain information about clinical as well as environmental and organizational factors that could affect fall risk but are not explicitly recorded by the provider as a fall risk factors. In our study, potential fall risk factors were documented for more than half of the sample. Further research is needed to determine the predictive value of these factors.; Implications for Policy or Practice: This study highlights a potentially rich but understudied source of actionable fall risk data. Furthermore, the application of novel methods to identify quality and safety measures in RNs' notes can facilitate inclusion of RNs' voices in patient outcomes and health services research.

AB OBJECTIVE: Vocal fold nodules are benign vocal fold lesions that can adversely affect quality of life. Differential diagnosis and treatment modalities of this disease are variable and patients often tend to use online materials to learn the insights. Access to knowledge via Internet is very easy; however, it is important to choose wisely because false and biased information might lead the patient to an inappropriate decision. In this study, we have evaluated the quality, readability, and understandability of online materials for vocal fold nodules.; METHODS: An Internet search was performed for "Vocal fold nodule," "vocal fold nodule treatment," and "voice therapy for vocal fold nodule" by using Google search engine. Readability of each website was evaluated by using www.readable.io. Understandability and actionability of pages were measured by using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). In the end, DISCERN instrument was used to measure the quality of information presented.; RESULTS: After exclusion, total of 26 web pages were evaluated during the study. Four web pages graded as A level, 5 as B level, 11 as C level, and 5 as D level for language use. Average grade level for all of the web pages is 11.14 ± 1.75. Overall understandability score was found 59.0+ 12.1 (26.7-77.1), and overall quality score was measured 34.95 + 6.58 (53.75-26.5).; CONCLUSION: The quality, readability, and understandability of the written materials are very low and in order for patients to read and learn from the online sources, contents of the written materials should be revised.

AB Precision medicine seeks to use genomic data to help provide the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. Next-generation sequencing technology allows for the rapid and accurate sequencing of many genes at once. This technology is becoming more common in oncology, though the clinical benefit of incorporating it into precision medicine strategies remains under significant debate. In this manuscript, we discuss the early findings of the impact of next-generation sequencing on cancer patient outcomes. We investigate why not all patients with genomic variants linked to a specific therapy receive that therapy and describe current barriers. Finally, we explore the current state of health insurance coverage for individual genome sequencing and targeted therapies for cancer. Based on our analysis, we recommend increased transparency around the determination of "actionable mutations" and a heightened focus on investigating the variations in health insurance coverage across patients receiving sequencing-matched therapies.

AB Susceptibility testing of fungi against antifungal drugs commonly used for therapy is a key component of the care of patients with invasive fungal infections. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) has progressed in recent decades to finally become standardized and available as both Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) reference methods and in commercial manual/automated phenotypic methods. In clinical practice, the Sensititre YeastOne and Etest methods are widely used for AFST, particularly for sterile site isolates of Candida. Nevertheless, AFST is moving toward new phenotypic methods, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), that are capable of providing rapid, and potentially more actionable, results for the treating clinician. Our objective is to summarize updated data on phenotypic methods for AFST of Candida and Aspergillus species and to assess their significance in view of opposing, but emerging, molecular genotypic methods.

AB Outdoor recreation is one of many important benefits provided by public lands. Data on recreational use are critical for informing management of recreation resources, however, managers often lack actionable information on visitor use for large protected areas that lack controlled access points. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential for social media data (e.g., geotagged images shared on Flickr and trip reports shared on a hiking forum) to provide land managers with useful measures of recreational use to dispersed areas, and to provide lessons learned from comparing several more traditional counting methods. First, we measure daily and monthly visitation rates to individual trails within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest (MBSNF) in western Washington. At 15 trailheads, we compare counts of hikers from infrared sensors, timelapse cameras, and manual on-site counts, to counts based on the number of shared geotagged images and trip reports from those locations. Second, we measure visitation rates to each National Forest System (NFS) unit across the US and compare annual measurements derived from the number of geotagged images to estimates from the US Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring Program. At both the NFS unit and the individual-trail scales, we found strong correlations between traditional measures of recreational use and measures based on user-generated content shared on the internet. For national forests in every region of the country, correlations between official Forest Service statistics and geotagged images ranged between 55% and 95%. For individual trails within the MBSNF, monthly visitor counts from on-site measurements were strongly correlated with counts from geotagged images (79%) and trip reports (91%). The convenient, cost-efficient and timely nature of collecting and analyzing user-generated data could allow land managers to monitor use over different seasons of the year and at sites and scales never previously monitored, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of recreational use patterns and values.

AB BACKGROUND: RNA-seq is the most commonly used sequencing application. Not only does it measure gene expression but it is also an excellent media to detect important structural variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion (Indels) or fusion transcripts. However, detection of these variants is challenging and complex from RNA-seq. Here we describe a sensitive and accurate analytical pipeline which detects various mutations at once for translational precision medicine.; METHODS: The pipeline incorporates most sensitive aligners for Indels in RNA-Seq, the best practice for data preprocessing and variant calling, and STAR-fusion is for chimeric transcripts. Variants/mutations are annotated, and key genes can be extracted for further investigation and clinical actions. Three datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the pipeline for SNVs, indels and fusion transcripts.; RESULTS: For the well-defined variants from NA12878 by GIAB project, about 95% and 80% of sensitivities were obtained for SNVs and indels, respectively, in matching RNA-seq. Comparison with other variant specific tools showed good performance of the pipeline. For the lung cancer dataset with 41 known and oncogenic mutations, 39 were detected by the pipeline with STAR aligner and all by the GSNAP aligner. An actionable EML4 and ALK fusion was also detected in one of the tumors, which also demonstrated outlier ALK expression. For 9 fusions spiked-into RNA-seq libraries with different concentrations, the pipeline was able to detect all in unfiltered results although some at very low concentrations may be missed when filtering was applied.; CONCLUSIONS: The new RNA-seq workflow is an accurate and comprehensive mutation profiler from RNA-seq. Key or actionable mutations are reliably detected from RNA-seq, which makes it a practical alternative source for personalized medicine.

AB In genomic medicine, the familiarity and inexactness of the term "actionable" can lead to multiple interpretations and mistaken beliefs about realistic treatment options. As part of a larger study focusing on public attitudes toward policies for the return of secondary genomic results, we looked at how members of the lay public interpret the term "medically actionable" in the context of genetic testing. We also surveyed a convenience sample of oncologists as part of a separate study and asked them to define the term "medically actionable." After being provided with a definition of the term, 21 out of 60 (35%) layperson respondents wrote an additional action not specified in the provided definition (12 mentioned "cure" and 9 mentioned environment or behavioral change) and 17 (28%) indicated "something can be done" with no action specified. In contrast, 52 surveyed oncologists did not mention environment, behavioral change, or cure. Based on our findings, we propose that rather than using the term "actionable" alone, providers should also say "what they mean" to reduce miscommunication and confusion that could negatively impact medical decision-making. Lastly, to guide clinicians during patient-provider discussion about genetic test results, we provide examples of phrasing to facilitate clearer communication and understanding of the term "actionable."

AB Traditionally, systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the primary treatment modality in metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) while treatment of the primary tumor has been reserved for patients with clinically localized disease. Emerging data suggests that treating the primary tumor in patients with metastatic disease may provide a survival benefit. However, these studies are fraught with selection bias towards patients with favorable disease characteristics. Despite these limitations, clinicians are becoming increasingly interested in consolidative treatment of the primary tumor in this setting. Many translational models and observational studies of cytoreduction in mPCa have yielded compelling results, suggesting a potential biological and clinical benefit. While there are no published randomized control trials on cytoreduction in mPCa, the literature regarding safety, feasibility, and potential symptomatic benefit of cytoreductive prostatectomy (CRP) in mPCa supports further investigation. Thus, MEDLINE and PubMed electronic databases were queried for English language articles related to patients with mPCa who underwent radical prostatectomy. Keywords used include: cytoreductive prostatectomy, radical prostatectomy, oligometastatic, mPCa, and oligometastasis. In this review we examine the literature regarding the feasibility of CRP as well as the reported oncologic outcomes, limitations of the literature, and future directions. Since there is currently no level one evidence to support its use, CRP should not be applied outside a clinical trial. A better understanding of the biology driving mPCa, in conjunction with standardization of clinical trials, will help expedite actionable data acquisition that may improve clinical outcomes.

AB Assessment of residents is optimally performed through processes and platforms that provide daily feedback, which can be immediately acted on. Given the documentation required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), effective data management, integration, and presentation are crucial to ease the burden of manual documentation and increase the timeliness of actionable information. To this end, the authors modeled the learning activities of residents using the Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI) framework, which is a standard framework for the learning community. On the basis of the xAPI framework and using open-source software to extend their existing infrastructure, the authors developed a Web-based dashboard that provides residents with a more holistic view of their educational experience. The dashboard was designed around the ACGME radiology milestones and provides real-time feedback to residents using various assessment metrics derived from multiple data sources. The purpose of this article is to describe the dashboard's architecture and components, the design and technical considerations, and the lessons learned in implementing the dashboard. ©RSNA, 2018.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare information sharing and advice networks' relationships with patient safety outcomes.; BACKGROUND: Communication contributes to medical errors, but rarely is it clear what elements of communication are key.; METHODS: We investigated relationships of information-sharing and advice networks to patient safety outcomes in 24 patient care units from 3 hospitals over 7 months. Web-based questionnaires completed via Android tablets provided data to create 2 networks using ORA, a social network analysis application. Each hospital provided nurse-sensitive patient safety outcomes.; RESULTS: In both networks, medication errors correlated positively with node count and average distance and negatively with clustering coefficient. Density and weighted density negatively correlated with medication errors and falls in both networks. Eigenvector and total degree centrality correlated negatively with both safety outcomes, whereas betweenness centrality positively related to falls in the information-sharing network.; CONCLUSION: Technology-enabled social network analysis data collection is feasible and can provide managers actionable system-level information.

AB BACKGROUND: A dearth of effective and affordable treatment options has rendered nonpharmacological self-management a crucial part of living with migraine-a debilitating neurobiological condition without cure that disproportionately disables vulnerable women.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the development and use of a systems thinking, problem-structuring data collection approach that was applied to the study of migraine self-management with women in diverse social locations.; METHODS: Two systems mapping activities were developed for use in focus groups: one to unpack a migraine episode (system support map) and the other (connection circle [CC]) to construct a mental model of self-management. Later in the process, a strengths-based problem-solving tool was developed to replace the CC.; RESULTS: The CCs-often enlightening for affluent participants-left marginalized women feeling overwhelmed and defeated, as a solution to one challenge became the cause of another. Through constant comparison analysis, we recalibrated the approach using a theory, clinical experience, and participant feedback and replaced the CC with a strengths-based problem-solving activity highlighting relationships and trade-offs in a more agential, actionable way.; DISCUSSION: Bringing a critical lens and strengths-based approaches to work with vulnerable populations can replace traditional deficit thinking in healthcare, developing options for leveraging resources and understanding complex health behaviors without losing sight of systemic, distributional justice issues. These systems thinking tools can provide a way to extrapolate the complexities of actual self-management behaviors and challenges faced by vulnerable women with migraine versus what they may be instructed to do by a medical model that does not always account for the social and structural determinants of equity and health.

AB BACKGROUND: Precision medicine guided by comprehensive genome sequencing represents a potential treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer. However, clinical sequencing for pancreatic cancer entails several practical difficulties. We have launched an in-house clinical sequencing system and started genomic testing for patients with cancer in clinical practice. We have analyzed the clinical utility of this system in pancreatic cancer.; METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with pancreatic cancer who visited our division. Genomic DNA was extracted from both tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the patients. We performed a comprehensive genomic testing using targeted amplicon sequencing for 160 cancer-related genes. The primary endpoints were the detection rates of potential actionable and druggable gene alterations. The secondary endpoints were the detection rate of secondary germline findings, the rate of re-biopsy required for genome sequencing, survival time after the initial visit (post-sequencing survival time), and turnaround time.; RESULTS: Although re-biopsy was required for 25% (5/20) of all patients, genomic testing was performed in all patients. Actionable and druggable gene alterations were detected in 100% (20/20) and 35% (7/20) of patients, respectively, whereas secondary germline findings were detected in 5% (1/20) of patients. The median turnaround times for physicians and patients were 20 and 26 days, respectively. The median post-sequencing survival time was 10.3 months. Only 10% (2/20) of all patients were treated with therapeutic agents based on the outcomes of genomic testing.; CONCLUSIONS: The clinical application of comprehensive genomic testing for pancreatic cancer was feasible and promising in clinical practice.

AB Current clinical anti-androgen therapies in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) are driving an increased incidence of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a histological variant exhibiting reduced androgen receptor levels and expression of neuroendocrine markers. The mechanisms underlying the development of NEPC are poorly understood. A set of available data from a well-validated xenograft model of NEPC was used to analyze the exact role of protein kinase (PK) played in the development of NEPC. Fifty-four actionable and druggable PKs, mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt, mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways, were screened out from the drastically changed PKs during NEPC transdifferentiation. Further analysis based on the crosstalk of these above signaling pathways finally singled out 10 PKs considered drivers and therapeutic targets in the development and treatment of NEPC. In vitro, the variation trend of PK expression observed during NEPC transdifferentiation could be recapitulated in PCa cell lines with different malignant degree. The predicted kinase targets exhibited different sensibilities in the restriction of PC3 cell growth. Selective actionable and druggable PKs may act as drivers in the progression of NEPC, and most of them can be used as potential therapeutic targets in clinical practice.

AB Visualizations of uncertainty in data are often presented to the public without explanations of their graphical conventions and are often misunderstood by nonexperts. The "cone of uncertainty" used to visualize hurricane forecasts is a case in point. Here we examined the effects of explaining graphical conventions on understanding of the cone of uncertainty. In two experiments, participants were given instructions with and without an explanation of these graphical conventions. We examined the effect of these instructions on both explicit statements of common misconceptions and users interpretation of hurricane forecasts, specifically their predictions of damage from the hurricane over space and time. Enhanced instructions reduced misconceptions about the cone of uncertainty as expressed in explicit beliefs, and in one experiment also reduced predictions of damage overall. Examination of individual response profiles for the damage estimate task revealed qualitative differences between individuals that were not evident in aggregate response profiles. This research reveals mixed results for the effectiveness of instructions on comprehension of uncertainty visualizations and suggests a more nuanced approach that focuses on the individual's knowledge and beliefs about the domain and visualization.

AB Molecular testing on advanced metastatic melanoma is critical for guiding targeted therapy. Traditionally, this analysis has relied on isolated BRAF V600E analysis; however, more recently targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) is being utilized. The clinical utility of BRAF V600E allele-specific PCR and targeted NGS were compared for metastatic melanoma samples sent to UHCMC pathology during a two and half year span. In two thirds of cases, negative for BRAF V600E, additional mutations were detected that may stratify patients for potential or approved targeted therapies. Targeted-NGS testing is feasible and cost-affordable and provides additional potentially actionable information for patients with BRAF V600E/K negative metastatic melanoma. Based on this analysis, we have adopted to screen patients with advanced melanoma with allele-specific V600E/K PCR and reflex negative cases for targeted NGS to maximize patient benefit.

AB BACKGROUND: Counseling patients with written materials relies equally on patients' health literacy to understand their disease and its treatment, and the written materials' effectiveness communicating clearly in accessible and actionable ways. Only about 12% of the US population is adequately health literate.; OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of reducing the health literacy demands of written patient health information.; METHODS: 805 patients were screened for health literacy, and recruited for balanced cohorts of adequate and low literacy, and high and normal blood pressure. Half of each patient cohort received either standard or "health literacy-friendly" drug summaries (i.e. Patient Package Inserts, or PPIs or "leaflets") along with a standardized health literacy assessment scale.; RESULTS: The literacy-friendly drug summary improved comprehension of drug-related information overall from 50% to 71% correct responses. Adequate literacy patients improved from 58% correct to 90%, while lower literacy patients improved from 42% to 52% correct in response to the health literacy-friendly PPIs.; CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy demands require special attention in developing and using written drug summary materials. Additionally, pharmacists should be provided additional information and counseling support materials to facilitate communications with low health literacy level patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Published research evidence is typically not readily applicable to practice but needs to be actively mobilised.; OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the mechanisms used by information professionals with a specific knowledge mobilisation role to make evidence useful for local decision making and planning of public health interventions.; METHODS: Data are drawn from a NIHR project that studied how, when, where and by whom published research evidence is used in commissioning and planning across two sites (one in England and one in Scotland). Data included 11 in-depth interviews with information professionals, observations at meetings and documentary analysis.; RESULTS: Published research evidence is made fit for local commissioning and planning purposes by information professionals through two mechanisms. They localise evidence (relate evidence to local context and needs) and tailor it (present actionable messages).; DISCUSSION: Knowledge mobilisation roles of information professionals are not recognised and researched. Information professionals contribute to the 'inform' and 'relational' functions of knowledge mobilisation; however, they are less involved in improving the institutional environment for sustainable knowledge sharing.; CONCLUSION: Information professionals are instrumental in shaping what evidence enters local decision making processes. Identifying and supporting knowledge mobilisation roles within health libraries should be the focus of future research and training. © 2018 Health Libraries Group.

AB INTRODUCTION: Surgery and radiation therapy are the standard treatment options for meningiomas, but these treatments are not always feasible. Expression profiling was performed to determine the presence of therapeutic actionable biomarkers for prioritization and selection of agents.; METHODS: Meningiomas (n=115) were profiled using a variety of strategies including next-generation sequencing (592-gene panel: n=14; 47-gene panel: n=94), immunohistochemistry (n=8-110), and fluorescent and chromogenic in situ hybridization (n=5-70) to determine mutational and expression status.; RESULTS: The median age of patients in the cohort was 60 years, with a range spanning 6-90 years; 52% were female. The most frequently expressed protein markers were EGFR (93%; n=44), followed by PTEN (77%; n=110), BCRP (75%; n=8), MRP1 (65%, n=23), PGP (62%; n=84), and MGMT (55%; n=97). The most frequent mutation among all meningioma grades occurred in the NF2 gene at 85% (11/13). Recurring mutations in SMO and AKT1 were also occasionally detected. PD-L1 was expressed in 25% of grade III cases (2/8) but not in grade I or II tumors. PD-1+T cells were present in 46% (24/52) of meningiomas. TOP2A and thymidylate synthase expression increased with grade (I=5%, II=22%, III=62% and I=5%, II=23%, III=47%, respectively), whereas progesterone receptor expression decreased with grade (I=79%, II=41%, III=29%).; CONCLUSION: If predicated on tumor expression, our data suggest that therapeutics directed toward NF2 and TOP2A could be considered for most meningioma patients.

AB PROBLEM: Difficult venous access is a common problem in health care-especially in the emergency setting-that relies on quick diagnostics to differentiate patient acuities and administer critical medications. The creation of a dedicated team to address difficult venous access (DVA) is a possible solution to the problems of delayed venous access, yet no studies have been published on implementing such a team in the emergency department.; METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study in an urban emergency department. Researchers performed chart audits of staff-identified patients with DVA to gather baseline data. A DVA team was subsequently implemented 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Data were recorded on patients referred to the team and included time, number of IV attempts, and patient characteristics.; RESULTS: Baseline data were collected on 53 patients, and postintervention data included 135 patients. The implementation of a DVA team decreased the mean lab order-to-lab completion time by 115 minutes (P < 0.0001). Decreases in the number of attempts were not statistically significant. Patients requiring increased numbers of IV attempts also had many common characteristics including history of multiple attempts, poor skin quality, and IV drug use.; DISCUSSION: The use of a dedicated team for DVA reduces the lag time from physician orders to actionable diagnostics or administration of medication. A dedicated DVA technician is a concrete solution to threats of patient safety, as well as ED crowding, and has the potential to affect both patient- and department-level care.

AB BACKGROUND: Formative assessment of operative performance is a mandatory part of surgical training. Engagement with assessment is limited in part by the time-consuming nature and the high perceived stakes of current assessment tools.; OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to develop and collect validity evidence for a new operative assessment tool that addresses barriers to assessment that current trainers and trainees experience.; METHODS: We developed the Generic Operative Supervised Learning Event (GOSLE). Orthopedic trainees were invited to complete GOSLEs with their trainers after surgical procedures. Experienced consultants assessed videotaped operations performed by trainees using the GOSLE. Validity evidence for content, relationships to other scores, internal structure, response process, and consequences of testing were evaluated.; RESULTS: A total of 250 GOSLEs were completed. A strong correlation was found between the GOSLE scores and the Procedure-Based Assessment ratings (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). Rasch analysis confirmed satisfactory internal structure of the rating scale, with sequential increases in rating as performance improved. The reproducibility coefficient was 0.88, with 10 assessments of the same trainee who has to achieve a reliability coefficient of 0.8. Over 90% of users found the GOSLE easy to use, with most preferring it to other assessment methods. Feedback quality was higher using the GOSLE than with current assessments.; CONCLUSION: We have collected validity evidence across multiple domains in support of the GOSLE. Its psychometric performance is comparable to that of current assessments. It is preferred by trainers and trainees over existing assessments.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular profiling of advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) is essential to identify patients who may benefit from targeted treatments. In the last years, the number of potentially actionable molecular alterations has rapidly increased. Next-generation sequencing allows for the analysis of multiple genes simultaneously.; AIMS: To evaluate the feasibility and the throughput of next-generation sequencing in clinical molecular diagnostics of advanced NSCLC.; METHODS: A single-institution cohort of 535 non-squamous NSCLC was profiled using a next-generation sequencing panel targeting 22 actionable and cancer-related genes.; RESULTS: 441 non-squamous NSCLC (82.4%) harboured at least one gene alteration, including 340 cases (63.6%) with clinically relevant molecular aberrations. Mutations have been detected in all but one gene (FGFR1) of the panel. Recurrent alterations were observed in KRAS, TP53, EGFR, STK11 and MET genes, whereas the remaining genes were mutated in <5% of the cases. Concurrent mutations were detected in 183 tumours (34.2%), mostly impairing KRAS or EGFR in association with TP53 alterations.; CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the feasibility of targeted next-generation sequencing in clinical setting. The majority of NSCLC harboured mutations in clinically relevant genes, thus identifying patients who might benefit from different targeted therapies. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB CONTEXT: Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) rates in the United States more than doubled between 1998 and 2010. Advanced maternal age and chronic comorbidities do not completely explain the increase in SMM or how to effectively address it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have called for facility-level multidisciplinary review of SMM for potential preventability and have issued implementation guidelines.; IMPLEMENTATION: Within Illinois, SMM was identified as any intensive or critical care unit admission and/or 4 or more units of packed red blood cells transfused at any time from conception through 42 days postpartum. All cases meeting this definition were counted during statewide surveillance. Cases were selected for review on the basis of their potential to yield insights into factors contributing to preventable SMM or best practices preventing further morbidity or death. If the SMM review committee deemed a case potentially preventable, it identified specific factors associated with missed opportunities and made actionable recommendations for quality improvement.; EVALUATION: Approximately 1100 cases of SMM were identified from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, yielding a rate of 76 SMM cases per 10 000 pregnancies. Reviews were conducted on 142 SMM cases. Most SMM cases occurred during delivery hospitalization and more than half were delivered by cesarean section. Hemorrhage was the primary cause of SMM (>50% of the cases).; DISCUSSION: Facility-level SMM review was feasible and acceptable in statewide implementation. States that are planning SMM reviews across obstetric facilities should permit ample time for translation of recommendations to practice. Although continued maternal mortality reviews are valuable, they are not sufficient to address the increasing rates of SMM and maternal death. In-depth multidisciplinary review offers the potential to identify factors associated with SMM and interventions to prevent women from moving along the continuum of severity.

AB PURPOSE: To understand the awareness of sedentary behavior, as well as the perceived facilitators and barriers to reducing sedentary behaviors from the perspectives of patients undertaking an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program, and from staff involved in supporting patient self-management.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted at a large cardiac rehabilitation program in a metropolitan city in Canada. Guided by an ecological framework, semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with 15 patients, and in two focus groups with six staff. Transcribed interviews were analyzed by thematic analysis.; RESULTS: Patients placed little importance on reducing sedentary behavior as they were unconvinced of the health benefits, did not perceive themselves to be sedentary, or associated such behaviors with enjoyment and relaxation. While staff were aware of the risks, they saw them as less critical than other health behaviors. Intrapersonal factors (physical and psychosocial health) and environment factors (the information environment, socio-cultural factors) within leisure time, the home, and work, influenced sedentary behavior.; CONCLUSIONS: While these findings require further testing, future interventions may be effective if aimed at increasing awareness of the health benefits of reducing sedentary behavior, utilizing existing behavior change strategies, and using a participatory approach to tailor strategies to patients. Implications for rehabilitation Cardiac rehabilitation programs effectively use exercise promotion to improve the health of people with established cardiovascular disease. As sedentary lifestyles become more prevalent, recommendations to reduce the health risks of prolonged sedentary behavior that are specific to the characteristics and prognostic profiles of cardiac rehabilitation patients are needed. Cardiac rehabilitation programs must consider extending existing behavior change strategies utilized for exercise promotion towards addressing sedentary behaviors in order to be effective at reducing the sedentary time of patients. A participatory approach involving both patients and health professionals can support patients in reducing their sedentary behavior by providing a supportive environment for behavior change, increasing awareness and understanding of risks, discussing the feasibility of potential strategies, and setting achievable and actionable goals.

AB BACKGROUND: The majority of US children do not meet physical activity recommendations. Schools are an important environment for promoting physical activity in children, yet most school districts do not offer enough physical activity opportunities to meet recommendations. This study aimed to identify school districts across the country that demonstrated exemplary efforts to provide students with many physical activity opportunities and to understand the factors that facilitated their programmatic success.; METHODS: A total of 59 districts were identified as model districts by members of the Physical Activity and Health Innovation Collaborative, an ad hoc activity associated with the Roundtable on Obesity Solutions at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with consenting stakeholders from 23 school districts to understand physical education and activity efforts and elucidate factors that led to the success of these districts' physical activity programming. Districts were geographically and socioeconomically diverse and varied in their administrative and funding structure.; RESULTS: Most districts did not offer the recommended 150 or 225min of physical activity a week through physical education alone; yet all districts offered a range of programs outside of physical education that provided additional opportunities for students to be physically active. The average number of school-based physical activity programs offered was 5.5, 3.5 and 2.1 for elementary, middle and high schools, respectively. Three overarching and broadly relevant themes were identified that were associated with successfully enhancing physical activity opportunities for students: soliciting and maintaining the support of champions, securing funding and/or tangible support, and fostering bi-directional partnerships between the district and community organizations and programs. Not only were these three themes critical for the development of physical activity opportunities, but they also remained important for the implementation, evaluation and sustainability of programs. These themes also did not differ substantially by the socioeconomic status of districts.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the success of school districts across the nation in providing ample opportunities for physical activity despite considerable variability in socioeconomic status and resources. These results can inform future research and provide actionable evidence for school districts to enhance physical activity opportunities to students.

AB BACKGROUND: The interrelationships between research evidence and policy-making are complex. Different theoretical frameworks exist to explain general evidence-policy interactions. One largely unexplored element of these interrelationships is how evidence interrelates with, and influences, policy/political agenda-setting. This review aims to identify the elements and processes of theories, frameworks and models on interrelationships of research evidence and health policy-making, with a focus on actionability and agenda-setting in the context of mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).; METHODS: A systematic review of theories was conducted based on the BeHeMOTh search method, using a tested and refined search strategy. Nine electronic databases and other relevant sources were searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Two reviewers screened the abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, extracted data and performed quality assessments. Analysis was based on a thematic analysis. The included papers had to present an actionable theoretical framework/model on evidence and policy interrelationships, such as knowledge translation or evidence-based policy, specifically target the agenda-setting process, focus on mental health, be from LMICs and published in English.; RESULTS: From 236 publications included in the full text analysis, no studies fully complied with our inclusion criteria. Widening the focus by leaving out 'agenda-setting', we included ten studies, four of which had unique conceptual frameworks focusing on mental health and LMICs but not agenda-setting. The four analysed frameworks confirmed research gaps from LMICs and mental health, and a lack of focus on agenda-setting. Frameworks and models from other health and policy areas provide interesting conceptual approaches and lessons with regards to agenda-setting.; CONCLUSION: Our systematic review identified frameworks on evidence and policy interrelations that differ in their elements and processes. No framework fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Four actionable frameworks are applicable to mental health and LMICs, but none specifically target agenda-setting. We have identified agenda-setting as a research theory gap in the context of mental health knowledge translation in LMICs. Frameworks from other health/policy areas could offer lessons on agenda-setting and new approaches for creating policy impact for mental health and to tackle the translational gap in LMICs.

AB BACKGROUND: A national priority at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to increase the availability and accessibility of evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) across all VA medical facilities. Yet many veterans, particularly those who use remote outpatient VA clinics, still do not receive much needed evidence-based treatment. Strategies are needed for supporting mental health providers at rural VA community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) as they translate their clinical training to routine practice. The Coordinated Anxiety Learning Management (CALM) program is a computer-delivered program that supports the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) by providers in outpatient settings to patients with depression and anxiety, including posttraumatic stress disorder.; OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were to (1) adapt an existing computer-based program to rural VA CBOCs through feedback from key stakeholder focus groups; (2) develop a prototype of the adapted program; and (3) determine the adapted program's acceptability and feasibility. Mental health stakeholders included VA leaders (n=4) in the implementation of EBPs, VA experts (n=4) in CBT, VA CBOC mental health providers (n=8), and veterans (n=8) diagnosed with a mental health condition treated using the CALM program and receiving treatment in a VA CBOC.; METHODS: An iterative approach comprising 3 waves of focus group discussions was used to develop a modified prototype of CALM. Following each wave of focus group discussions, template analysis was used to rapidly communicate stakeholder recommendations and feedback to the design team. The original program was first adapted through a process of data collection, design modification, and product development. Next, a prototype was developed. Finally, the redesigned program was tested for acceptability and feasibility through a live demonstration.; RESULTS: Key stakeholders suggested modifications to the original CALM program that altered its modules' appearance by incorporating veteran-centric content. These modifications likely have no impact on the integrity of the original CALM program, but have altered its content to reflect better the demographic characteristics and experiences of rural veterans. Feedback from stakeholder groups indicates that changes will help VA patients identify with the program content, potentially enhancing their treatment engagement.; CONCLUSIONS: The development model was effective for economically gathering actionable recommendations from stakeholders to adapt a computer-based program, and it can result in the development of an acceptable and feasible computer-delivered intervention. Results have implications for developing computer-based programs targeting behavior change more broadly and enhancing engagement in EBP. ©Traci H Abraham, Kathy Marchant-Miros, Michael B McCarther, Michelle G Craske, Geoffrey M Curran, Lisa K Kearney, Carolyn Greene, Jan A Lindsay, Michael A Cucciare.

AB Applied visualization researchers often work closely with domain collaborators to explore new and useful applications of visualization. The early stages of collaborations are typically time consuming for all stakeholders as researchers piece together an understanding of domain challenges from disparate discussions and meetings. A number of recent projects, however, report on the use of creative visualization-opportunities (CVO) workshops to accelerate the early stages of applied work, eliciting a wealth of requirements in a few days of focused work. Yet, there is no established guidance for how to use such workshops effectively. In this paper, we present the results of a 2-year collaboration in which we analyzed the use of 17 workshops in 10 visualization contexts. Its primary contribution is a framework for CVO workshops that: 1) identifies a process model for using workshops; 2) describes a structure of what happens within effective workshops; 3) recommends 25 actionable guidelines for future workshops; and 4) presents an example workshop and workshop methods. The creation of this framework exemplifies the use of critical reflection to learn about visualization in practice from diverse studies and experience.

AB There exists a gap between visualization design guidelines and their application in visualization tools. While empirical studies can provide design guidance, we lack a formal framework for representing design knowledge, integrating results across studies, and applying this knowledge in automated design tools that promote effective encodings and facilitate visual exploration. We propose modeling visualization design knowledge as a collection of constraints, in conjunction with a method to learn weights for soft constraints from experimental data. Using constraints, we can take theoretical design knowledge and express it in a concrete, extensible, and testable form: the resulting models can recommend visualization designs and can easily be augmented with additional constraints or updated weights. We implement our approach in Draco, a constraint-based system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). We demonstrate how to construct increasingly sophisticated automated visualization design systems, including systems based on weights learned directly from the results of graphical perception experiments.

The recent association of four oncogenic driver genes, ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1, as lung tumor predictive biomarkers has increased the need for development of up-to-date technologies for detection of these biomarkers in limited amounts of material.; METHODS: We describe here a multi-institutional study using the Ion AmpliSeq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel to interrogate previously characterized lung tumor samples.; RESULTS: Reproducibility between laboratories using diluted fusion-positive cell lines was 100%. A cohort of lung clinical research samples from different origins (tissue biopsies, tissue resections, lymph nodes and pleural fluid samples) were used to evaluate the panel. We observed 97% concordance for ALK (28/30 positive; 71/70 negative samples), 95% for ROS1 (3/4 positive; 19/18 negative samples), and 93% for RET (2/1 positive; 13/14 negative samples) between the AmpliSeq assay and other methodologies.; CONCLUSION: This methodology enables simultaneous detection of multiple ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 gene fusion transcripts in a single panel, enhanced by an integrated analysis solution. The assay performs well on limited amounts of input RNA (10ng) and offers an integrated single assay solution for detection of actionable fusions in lung adenocarcinoma, with potential savings in both cost and turn-around-time compared to the combination of all four assays by other methods.

AB BACKGROUND: We investigated the baseline characterization of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-derived circulating miR-221-3p/222-3p in isolated low HDL-C phenotype (ILHP) to enhance our understanding on their molecular pathological pattern prior to disease onset.; METHODS: We screened 174 asymptomatic subjects with isolated low HDL-C phenotype (n=88) and normal lipid phenotype (n=86), and detected circulating levels of CVD-derived circulating miR-221-3p/222-3p using TaqMan miRNA Real-time PCR detection system.; RESULTS: We found the inverted pattern of decreased circulating miR-221-3p (0.415 [0.249, 1.004] vs 0.658 [0.347, 1.534], p=0.002) versus increased miR-222-3p levels (0.379 [0.101, 0.701] vs 0.156 [0.043, 0.407], p < 0.001) in ILHP. The baseline levels of circulating miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p are correlated with serum HDL-C levels (miR-221-3p: r=0.306, p < 0.001; miR-222-3p: r=-0.201, p=0.008). Gender-based analysis showed female-specific elevation of circulating miR-221-3p in asymptomatic individual. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that circulating miR-222-3p is robustly independent factor (adjusted OR=8.42, 95%CI: 2.53-27.98, p < 0.001) and significantly improved the performance of the predictive clinical model distinguished ILHP from normal lipid phenotype (AUC: 0.816, 95%CI (0.754, 0.879) vs AUC: 0.771, 95%CI (0.702, 0.840); Z=2.169, p=0.030). Moreover, the increased original Ct ratio of miR-221-3p to miR-222-3p in male ILHP (1.003 [0.927, 1.063] vs 0.927 [0.858, 0.967], p < 0.001) significantly enhanced the ability to classify male ILHP compared with the male predictive clinical model (AUC: 0.851, 95%CI (0.770, 0.933) vs AUC: 0.759, 95%CI (0.659, 0.859); Z=2.474, p < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: The inverted pattern of circulating miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p are potentially clinically actionable signature for molecular pathology in isolated low HDL-C phenotype.

AB Genome-wide sequencing may generate secondary findings (SFs). It is recommended that validated, clinically actionable SFs are reported back to patients/research participants. To explore publics' perspectives on the best ways to do this, we performed a vignette study among Finnish adults. Our aim was to explore how lay people react to different types of hypothetical genomic SFs. Participants received a hypothetical letter revealing a SF predisposing to a severe but actionable disease-cardiovascular disease (familial hypercholesterolemia, long QT syndrome) or cancer (Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Participants (N=29) wrote down their initial reactions, and discussed (N=23) these in focus groups. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Reactions to hypothetical SFs varied according to perceived severity and familiarity of the diseases. SFs for cancer were perceived as more threatening than for cardiovascular diseases, but less distressing than risk for psychiatric or neurological disorders, which participants spontaneously brought up. Illness severity in terms of lived experience, availability of treatment, stigma, and individual's responsibility to control risk were perceived to vary across these disease types. In addition to clinical validity and utility, SF reporting practices need to take into account potential familiarity and lay illness representations of different diseases. Illness representations may influence willingness to receive SFs, and individuals' reactions to this information.

AB BACKGROUND: Active management of existing health technologies (e.g., devices, diagnostic, and/or medical procedures) to ensure the delivery of high value care is increasingly recognized around the world. A number of initiatives have raised awareness of technologies that may be overused, mis-used, or potentially harmful by compiling them into lists of low value care. However, despite the growing number of lists, changes to local healthcare practices remain challenging for many systems. The objective of this study was to develop and implement a process, leveraging existing initiatives and data assets, to produce a list of prioritized low value technologies for health technology reassessment (HTR).; METHODS: An expert advisory committee comprised of clinical experts and health system decision-makers was convened to determine key process requirements. Once developed, the process was piloted to assess feasibility in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC).; RESULTS: The expert advisory committee identified five required attributes for the process: data-driven, routine and replicable, actionable, stakeholder collaboration, and high return on investment. Guided by these attributes, a 5-step process was developed. First, over 1300 published low value technologies (i.e., from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] "do not do" recommendations, low value technologies in the Australian Medical Benefits Schedule, and Choosing Wisely "Top 5" lists) were identified. Using appropriate coding systems for BC's administrative health data (e.g., International Classification of Diseases [ICD]), the low value technologies were queried to examine frequencies and costs of technology use. This information was used to rank potential candidates for reassessment based on high annual budgetary impact. Lastly, clinical experts reviewed the ranked technologies prior to broad dissemination and stakeholder action. Pilot testing of the process in BC resulted in the prioritization of 9 initial candidate technologies for reassessment.; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first account of a systematic approach to move a collective body of low value technology recommendations into action in a healthcare setting. This work demonstrates the feasibility and strength of using administrative data to identify and prioritize low value technologies for HTR at a population-level.

AB To realise useful control over molecular motion in the future an extensive toolbox of both actionable molecules and stimuli-responsive units must be developed. Previously, our laboratory has reported 1,1'-disubstituted ferrocene (Fc) rotor units which assume a contracted/pi-stacked conformation until complexation of cationic metal ions causes rotation about the Ferrocene (Fc) molecular 'ball-bearing'. Herein, we explore the potential of using the photochemical ejection of [Ru(2,2'-bipyridyl)₂]2+ units as a stimulus for the rotational contraction of new ferrocene rotor units. Fc rotors with both 'regular' and 'inverse' 2-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole binding pockets and their corresponding [Ru(2,2'-bipyridyl)₂]2+ complexes were synthesised. The rotors and complexes were characterised using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopies, Electro-Spray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ESI⁻MS), and electrochemistry. The 1,1'-disubstituted Fc ligands were shown to pi-stack both in solution and solid state. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations (CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)) support the notion that complexation to [Ru(2,2'-bipyridyl)₂]2+ caused a rotation from the syn- to the anti-conformation. Upon photo-irradiation with UV light (254 nm), photo-ejection of the [Ru(2,2'-bipyridyl)₂(CH₃CN)₂]2+ units in acetonitrile was observed. The re-complexation of the [Ru(2,2'-bipyridyl)₂]2+ units could be achieved using acetone as the reaction solvent. However, the process was exceedingly slowly. Additionally, the Fc ligands slowly decomposed when exposed to UV irradiation meaning that only one extension and contraction cycle could be completed.

AB BACKGROUND: Matched tumor-normal sequencing, applied in precision cancer medicine, can identify unidentified germline Medically Actionable Variants (gMAVS) in cancer predisposition genes. We report patient preferences for the return of additional germline results, and describe various gMAV scenarios delivered through a clinical genetics service.; METHODS: Tumor profiling was offered to 1960 advanced cancer patients, of which 1556 underwent tumor-normal sequencing with multigene hotspot panels containing 20 cancer predisposition genes. All patients were provided with an IRB-approved consent for return of additional gMAVs.; RESULTS: Of the whole cohort 94% of patients consented to be informed of additional germline results and 5% declined, with no statistically significant differences based on age, sex, race or prior genetic testing. Eight patients were found to have gMAVs in a cancer predisposition gene. Five had previously unidentified gMAVs: three in TP53 (only one fulfilled Chompret's Revised criteria for Li-Fraumeni Syndrome), one in SMARCB1 in the absence of schwannomatosis features and one a TP53 variant at low allele frequency suggesting an acquired event in blood.; CONCLUSION: Interest in germline findings is high among patients who undergo tumor profiling. Disclosure of previously unidentified gMAVs present multiple challenges, thus supporting the involvement of a clinical genetics service in all tumor profiling programs.

AB Background: Molecular diagnostics for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has become the standard of care for personalized treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and EML4-ALK translocation represent the two most important alterations in first-line treatment decision-making. However, other potentially targetable alterations are also present.; Methods: One thousand consecutive NSCLC patients with EGFR wild type (wt) tumors diagnosed by routine molecular analysis were considered. KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PIK3CA, NRAS, ALK, MAP2K1, RET and DDR2 gene mutations were analyzed using the multiparametric Sequenom MassARRAY platform. EML4-ALK and ROS1 rearrangements were also assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. HER4 status was determined by direct sequencing.; Results: Three hundred and forty-eight (34.8%), 31 (3.1%), 39 (4.4%), 14 (1.8%), 6 (0.7%), 16 (1.8%), 5 (0.6%) and 9 (0.9%) patients showed an alteration in KRAS, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, NRAS, PIK3CA, MAPK1/2 and HER2 genes, respectively. Of the 657 patients for whom all markers were determined, 318 (48%) patients had at least one alteration. Eight patients showed overlapping mutations, 4 KRAS mutation/EML4-ALK translocation, one KRAS mutation/ROS1 rearrangement, 2 KRAS/PIK3CA mutations, and one BRAF/PIK3CA mutations.; Conclusions: About 50% of our patients had a potentially targetable alteration, confirming the usefulness of a multiparametric approach for routine molecular diagnostics aimed at identifying potential therapeutic targets.

AB The delivery of psychological services including screening, assessing, and providing interventions to suicidal individuals occurs within all public and organized care settings where psychologists practice. These services are typically the most demanding and important clinical tasks these psychologists will perform. To inform aspects of such practice, the journal issued a call for papers and 16 of the articles received in response are part of this special issue and reviewed in this Introduction. These articles inform three broad psychological service perspectives: conceptual models and assessment, interventions, and special populations and cultures. From female firefighters and adolescent girls with chronic pain, to our veterans and military personnel and those incarcerated, the samples drawn, studied, and written about in this special issue represent an effort to address our current need for actionable knowledge in this area. The opening section presents four papers on models and assessments, the next considers individual and group interventions and perspectives on access to care, and the final section walks us through a myriad of special populations and cultures to understand facets of the prediction and prevention of suicide.

AB Current approaches to assessing medication exposure fail to capture the complexity of the phenomenon and the context in which it occurs. This study's purpose was to develop a typology of subgroups of patients who share common patterns of medication exposure. To create the typology, we used an exemplar sample of 30 patients in a large public healthcare system who had been prescribed the pharmacogenetically actionable opioids codeine or tramadol. Data related to medication exposure were drawn from large data repositories. Using a person-oriented qualitative approach, eight subgroups of patients who shared common patterns of medication exposure were identified. The subgroups had one of five opioid prescription patterns (i.e., singular, episodic, switching, sustained, multiplex), and one of three types of primary foci of medical care (i.e., pain, comorbidities, both). The findings reveal medication exposure patterns that are dynamic, multidimensional, and complex, and the typology offers an innovative approach to assessing medication exposure.

AB As clinicians, we understand the development of atherosclerosis as a consequence of cholesterol deposition and inflammation in the arterial wall, both being triggered by traditional risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or diabetes mellitus. Another risk factor is genetic predisposition, as indicated by the predictive value of a positive family history. However, we had to wait until recently to appreciate the abundant contribution of genetic variation to the manifestation of atherosclerosis. Indeed, by now 164 chromosomal loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to affect the risk of coronary artery disease. By design, practically all risk variants discovered by GWAS are frequently found in our population, resulting in the fact that principally every Western European individual carries between 130 and 190 risk alleles at the known, genome-wide significant loci (there are 0, 1, or 2 risk alleles per locus). One can assume that it is this widespread disposition that makes mankind susceptible to the detrimental effects of lifestyle factors, which likewise increase the risk of atherosclerosis. In this review, we summarize the recent genetic discoveries and attempt to group the multiple genetic risk variants in functional groups that may become actionable from a preventive or therapeutic perspective.

AB AIMS: Any reference laboratory testing non-small cell lung cancer samples for predictive biomarkers needs to develop and validate a wide range of different molecular techniques, each with a specific time requirement and application. Updated international guidelines suggest that next generation sequencing (NGS) to be the initial procedure. However, in a non-negligible subset of cases, library generation may fail or amplicon coverage may be insufficient. In these NGS 'invalid' cases, the Idylla system may represent a viable option for rapid epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotyping.; METHODS: This retrospective study included 68 archival DNA samples previously processed by Ion Torrent NGS assay. Out of these, 43 cases, including 24 EGFR mutant samples, had a valid NGS result, whereas 25/68 (37%) were invalid. All samples were retested by directly pipetting the DNA inside the EGFR Idylla assay cartridge.; RESULTS: In all 43 cases with a valid NGS result, Idylla confirmed the EGFR mutational status. In particular, 24/24 (100%) of EGFR mutant samples as detected by NGS were confirmed by Idylla. Moreover, a large portion of cases (20/25; 80%) whose assessment by NGS was invalid were adequately processed by Idylla. Noteworthy, in 4/25 (16%) of cases, Idylla detected actionable EGFR mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Idylla assay could be very useful to quickly process cases for which NGS does not allow genotyping. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB AIMS: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a poorly differentiated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with aggressive behaviour. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic clinicopathological and genetic characteristics of PSCs.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-three cases of surgically treated PSCs were selected, 23 of which were subjected to mutation and copy number variation analysis using the 50-gene Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. The majority of the patients were male (32 of 53, 60.3%) and smokers (51 of 53, 96.2%). Overall, 25 (47.1%) patients died within 2-105months (mean=22.7months, median=15months) after diagnosis, and 28 were alive 3-141months (mean=38.7months, median=21.5months) after diagnosis. Five-year overall survival was 12.5%. KRAS codon 12/13 mutation in adenocarcinomas (P=0.01), age more than 70years (P=0.008) and tumour size ≥4.0cm (P=0.02) were associated strongly with worse outcome. TP53 (17 of 23, 74.0%) and KRAS codon 12 of 13mutations (10 of 23, 43.4%) were the most common genetic alterations. Potentially actionable variants were identified including ATM (four of 23, 17.3%), MET, FBXW7 and EGFR (two of 23, 8.7%), AKT1, KIT, PDGFRA, HRAS, JAK3 and SMAD4 (one of 23, 4.3%). MET exon 14 skipping and missense mutations were identified in two (11.1%) cases with adenocarcinoma histology. Copy number analysis showed loss of RB1 (three of 23, 13%) and ATM (two of 23, 8.7%). Copy number gains were seen in EGFR (two of 23, 13.0%) and in one (4.3%) of each PIK3CA, KRAS, MET and STK11.; CONCLUSIONS: Potentially targetable mutations can be identified in a subset of PSC, although most tumours harbour currently untargetable prognostically adverse TP53 and KRAS mutations. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: Many drug labels contain information on pharmacogenomic biomarkers (PGBMs), but the information is not necessarily actionable. Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) aims to clarify the level of action for PGBMs (PGx levels) implied in each label as issued by the US Food and Drug Administration. We wished to evaluate the association between the PGx level for US and Japanese drug labels and the insurance coverage for PGBM testing or approval for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) in each country.; METHODS: We investigated the information on PGBMs in US and Japanese drug labels with PGx levels, insurance coverage of PGBM tests and IVD approval in the US and Japan. We analysed the relationship of PGx levels with insurance coverage.; RESULTS: A total of 243 labels were listed by PharmGKB, and 215 (88%) had PGx levels for US labels and 52 (21%) for Japanese labels. Of the 215 US labels, 54 were designated as "Testing Required" in PGx levels. PGx levels in US labels were strongly associated with coverage of PGBM testing. Tests in 52 (96%) of the 54 labels with Testing Required had insurance coverage, 2 (50%) of 4 in "Testing Recommended," 38 (38%) of 100 in "Actionable PGx," 11 (19%) of 57 in "Informative PGx" and 3 (11%) of 28 in "No Level." In Japanese labels, only 14 of 52 were listed as Testing Required, and all were covered by the National Health Insurance in Japan.; WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The PGx level given in drug labels provides information on availability of PGBM testing. Higher PGx levels, based on better evidence of usefulness of PGBM testing, provide a route to broader test coverage. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women. KRAS mutations occur in ~ 25% of patients with lung cancer, and the presence of these mutations is associated with a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, efforts to directly target KRAS or its associated downstream MAPK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways have seen little or no benefits. Here, I hypothesize that KRAS-mutant tumors do not respond to KRAS pathway therapies due to the co-occurrence of other activated cell survival pathways and/or mechanisms.; METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify other potentially activated cell survival pathways in KRAS-mutant tumors, I performed association rule mining on somatic mutations in 725 metastatic lung cancer patient samples. I identified 67 additional genes that were mutated in at least 10% of the samples with KRAS mutations. This gene list was enriched with genes involved in the MAPK, AKT and STAT3 pathways, as well as in cell-cell adhesion, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. I also identified 160 overlapping subsets of three or more genes that code for oncogenic or tumor suppressive proteins that were mutated in at least 10% of the KRAS-mutant tumors.; CONCLUSIONS: I identified several genes that are co-mutated in primary KRAS-mutant lung cancer samples. I also identified subpopulations of KRAS-mutant lung cancers based on sets of genes that were co-mutated. Pre-clinical models that capture these subsets of KRAS-mutant tumors may enhance our understanding of lung cancer development and, in addition, facilitate the design of personalized treatment strategies for lung cancer patients carrying KRAS mutations.

AB As digital innovations continue to transform health systems in Canada, it is important to examine registered nurses' preparedness in informatics, and factors associated with informatics competency. An exploratory, descriptive, cross-sectional survey was used to determine self-perceived informatics competencies, and factors associated with competency, among practicing nurses in Alberta. Results from 2844 completed surveys showed that nurses' self-perceived informatics competency was slightly above the mark of competent. Perceptions of competency were highest on foundational computer literacy skills and lowest on information and knowledge management competencies. However, overall informatics competency mean scores varied significantly in relation to age, educational qualification, years of experience, and work setting. The quality of informatics training and support offered by employers contributed the most to variance in mean scores of total and subdomains of informatics competency. Other factors, such as age, educational qualification, work setting, previous informatics education, access to the Internet, use of health technology, access to supporting resources, informatics training, an informatics role, and continuing education in informatics, also contributed to mean scores variance in differing degrees. Findings from this study provide a basis for actionable policies to address informatics educational needs and support requirements among nurses practicing now and in the future.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between health literacy and trust in physicians and in the healthcare system.; Design: A cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of adults.; Setting: Taiwan.; Participants: Non-institutionalized adults (N = 2199).; Main measures: Trust in physicians was a composite measure assessing respondents' general trust in physicians and their perceptions of their physician's communication, medical skills, beneficence, honesty, confidentiality, respect and fairness. Trust in the healthcare system was a single-item measure. Health literacy was measured by four items.; Results: Respondents with higher health literacy had, overall, higher levels of trust in physicians (P<0.001) and in the healthcare system (P = 0.04). Health literacy remained significantly and positively associated with trust in physicians (P<0.001) and in the healthcare system (P = 0.001) after adjusting for respondents' sociodemographic characteristics.; Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that health literacy is positively associated with trust. Actionable plans targeting health literacy at the national and local levels to establish a health literate care environment may contribute to enhancing trust in physicians and the healthcare system.

AB Advance care planning (ACP) does not readily occur in medical settings and often gets missed. Older Latinos need ACP information to encourage advance directive (AD) completion indicating preferences for end-of-life (EOL) care.; OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences with counseling using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques and social workers to encourage ACP communication among older Latinos with advance chronic diseases. This study describes stages of readiness to plan for EOL care.; DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study with older Latinos who participated in a community-based intervention in Southern New Mexico.; METHODS: Participants in the intervention were selected because they received ACP education plus counseling involving MI to address resistance to ACP. Motivational interviewing counseling involved the following: (1) engaging in structured dialogue about ACP, (2) using and completing AD documentation, (3) encouraging ACP communication with providers and families, and (4) applying AD information into actionable behavior. We utilized a constant comparative method and thematic analysis to explore the meaning of older Latinos' experiences with MI counseling and stages of change.; RESULTS: Participants (n = 32) were mostly women (74.3%), half born in the United States and half from Mexico in the United States on average for 31.75 (standard deviation 16.22) years. Many had less than sixth grade education (31.3%) or had not completed high school (21.9%). Key themes indicate the following stages of change: (1) precontemplation, (2) contemplation, (3) preparation, (4) ACP action, and (5) maintenance.; CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the literature by identifying areas for adaption to enhance understanding and increase information to ultimately achieve the completion of ACP among Latinos.

AB Incidental findings in genomic data have been studied in great detail in the recent years, especially from population-scale data sets. However, little is known about the frequency of such findings in ethnic groups, specifically the Middle East, which were not previously covered in global sequencing studies. The availability of whole exome and genome data sets for a highly consanguineous Arab population from Qatar motivated us to explore the incidental findings in this population-scale data. The sequence data of 1005 Qatari individuals were systematically analyzed for incidental genetic variants in the 59 genes suggested by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. We identified four genetic variants which were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. These variants occurred in six individuals, suggesting a frequency of 0.59% in the population, much lesser than that previously reported from European and African populations. Our analysis identified a variant in RYR1 gene associated with Malignant Hyperthermia that has significantly higher frequency in the population compared to global frequencies. Evaluation of the allele frequencies of these variants suggested enrichment in sub-populations, especially in individuals of Sub-Saharan African ancestry. The present study thereby provides the information on pathogenicity and frequency, which could aid in genomic medicine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of incidental genetic findings in any Arab population and suggests ethnic differences in incidental findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient feedback is considered integral to quality improvement and professional development. However, while popular across the educational continuum, evidence to support its efficacy in facilitating positive behaviour change in a postgraduate setting remains unclear. This review therefore aims to explore the evidence that supports, or refutes, the impact of patient feedback on the medical performance of qualified doctors.; METHODS: Electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO were systematically searched for studies assessing the impact of patient feedback on medical performance published in the English language between 2006-2016. Impact was defined as a measured change in behaviour using Barr's (2000) adaptation of Kirkpatrick's four level evaluation model. Papers were quality appraised, thematically analysed and synthesised using a narrative approach.; RESULTS: From 1,269 initial studies, 20 articles were included (qualitative (n=8); observational (n=6); systematic review (n=3); mixed methodology (n=1); randomised control trial (n=1); and longitudinal (n=1) design). One article identified change at an organisational level (Kirkpatrick level 4); six reported a measured change in behaviour (Kirkpatrick level 3b); 12 identified self-reported change or intention to change (Kirkpatrick level 3a), and one identified knowledge or skill acquisition (Kirkpatrick level 2). No study identified a change at the highest level, an improvement in the health and wellbeing of patients. The main factors found to influence the impact of patient feedback were: specificity; perceived credibility; congruence with physician self-perceptions and performance expectations; presence of facilitation and reflection; and inclusion of narrative comments. The quality of feedback facilitation and local professional cultures also appeared integral to positive behaviour change.; CONCLUSION: Patient feedback can have an impact on medical performance. However, actionable change is influenced by several contextual factors and cannot simply be guaranteed. Patient feedback is likely to be more influential if it is specific, collected through credible methods and contains narrative information. Data obtained should be fed back in a way that facilitates reflective discussion and encourages the formulation of actionable behaviour change. A supportive cultural understanding of patient feedback and its intended purpose is also essential for its effective use.

AB OBJECTIVE: To date, the understanding of pediatric tumor genomics and how these genetic aberrations correlate with clinical outcome is lacking. Here, we report our experience with the next-generation sequencing (NGS) test program and discuss implications for the inclusion of molecular profiling into clinical pediatric oncology trials. We also aimed to explore studies on NGS in pediatric cancers and to quantify the variability of finding actionable mutations and the clinical implications.; METHODS: We present a retrospective case series of all patients whose tumor tissue underwent NGS tests during treatment in our department. We also reviewed the literature and carried out a meta-analysis to explore studies on NGS in pediatric cancers.; RESULTS: In 35/37 (94%) patients, we found at least one genomic alteration (GA); mean number of GAs per patient was 2 (range, 0-67), while 164 GAs were detected. Only 3 (8%) patients received precision medicine due to their GAs for a mean of 9 months (range, 5-14 months). Four studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled positive actionable mutation rate was 52% (95% CI 39%-66%), and the pooled rate of children who received precision medicine was 10% (95% CI 3%-20%).; CONCLUSIONS: In children and young adults with high-risk, recurrent, or refractory malignancies, tumor profiling results have clinical implications, despite barriers to the use of matched precision therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Precision medicine puts forward customized healthcare for cancer patients. An important way to accomplish this task is to stratify patients into those who may respond to a treatment and those who may not. For this purpose, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have been pursued.; OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on novel approaches and concepts of exploring biomarker discovery under the circumstances that technologies are developed, and data are accumulated for precision medicine.; RESULTS: The traditional mechanism-driven functional biomarkers have the advantage of actionable insights, while data-driven computational biomarkers can fulfill more needs, especially with tremendous data on the molecules of different layers (e.g. genetic mutation, mRNA, protein etc.) which are accumulated based on a plenty of technologies. Besides, the technology-driven liquid biopsy biomarker is very promising to improve patients' survival. The developments of biomarker discovery on these aspects are promoting the understanding of cancer, helping the stratification of patients and improving patients' survival.; CONCLUSION: Current developments on mechanisms-, data- and technology-driven biomarker discovery are achieving the aim of precision medicine and promoting the clinical application of biomarkers. Meanwhile, the complexity of cancer requires more effective biomarkers, which could be accomplished by a comprehensive integration of multiple types of biomarkers together with a deep understanding of cancer.

AB Until recently, chemotherapy has remained the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Excellent responses have been observed with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted treatments for those tumours with actionable mutations, resulting in a paradigm shift in the treatment approach for these patients. Elderly patients and those with poor performance status (PS), such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2, have historically been excluded from clinical trials due to poor outcomes. There is therefore a lack of data to define the optimal treatment strategy for these patients. Due to improved tolerability of novel therapies, inclusion of these patients in clinical trials has increased, and sub-group analyses have identified many treatments demonstrating potential activity. Here, we summarise key recent advances in the treatment of NSCLC, specifically evaluating their efficacy and tolerability in these patient cohorts.

AB INTRODUCTION: Apologizing to patients is an encouraged practice, yet little is known about how and why providers apologize and what insights apologies could provide in improving quality and safety.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether provider apologies in the electronic health record could identify patient safety concerns and opportunities for improvement.; METHODS: After performing a free-text search, we randomly selected 100 clinical notes from 1685 available containing terminology related to apology. We categorized the reason for apology, presence and classification of medical error, level of patient harm, and practice improvement opportunities. We compared patient events discovered from apologies in the medical record to standard patient incident report logs.; RESULTS: Of 100 randomly selected apologies, 37 were related to a delay in care, 14 to misunderstanding, 11 to access to care, and 8 to information technology. For apologies related to delay, the median delay was 6 days (mean = 8.9, range = 0-41). Twenty-four (65%) of the 37 delays were related to diagnostic testing.Medical errors were associated with 46 (46%) of the 100 apologies. Sixty-four (64%) of the 100 apologies were associated with actionable opportunities for improvement. These opportunities were classified into 37 discrete issues across 8 broad categories. When apology review was compared with standard incident report logs, 27 (73%) of the 37 discrete issues identified by patient apology review were not found in incident reporting; both methods identified similar rates of patient harm.; CONCLUSIONS: Review of apologies in the electronic health record can identify patient safety concerns and improvement opportunities not apparent through standard incident reporting.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review synthesizes the utility of measuring migraine triggers for the purpose of forecasting future headache attacks. The nature of forecasting models, headache triggers as inputs to such models, and how these trigger exposures can be measured for forecasting are reviewed. A critical evaluation of the existing forecasting models in the context of their potential application for preemptive treatment is considered.; RECENT FINDINGS: A substantial pool of candidate trigger factors could be considered in the creation of forecasting models. However, because mechanistic information about causal factors that precede a migraine attack is not well understood, and such factors are difficult to measure, empirical models that are based on trigger factors that are merely associated with the onset of headache activity are likely to be the focus of forecasting efforts in the near future. Of such factors, stress has considerable empirical support and has been used to successfully forecast future headache attacks within individuals over time. However, at present, existing models possess only modest levels of discrimination and lack strong resolution in generated predictions. Current headache forecasting models represent an important first step in accurately predicting future headache activity. However, to utilize these models in a preemptive treatment paradigm where the risk of headache is treated prior to the actual experience of pain, these models must achieve greater precision with good calibration and generate predictions that are clinically actionable by individuals in their real-time home environments.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy and second only to lung cancer in terms of mortality in women. Despite the incredible progress made in this field, metastatic breast cancer has a poor prognosis. In an era of personalized medicine, there is an urgent need for better knowledge of the biology leading to the disease, which can lead to the design of increasingly accurate drugs against patients' specific molecular aberrations. Among one of the actionable targets is the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway, triggered by specific ligands. The Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors/Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFRs/FGFs) axis offers interesting molecular targets to be pursued in clinical development. This mini-review will focus on the current knowledge of FGFR mutations, which lead to tumor formation and summarizes the state-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeted treatments against the FGFRs/FGFs axis in the context of BC.

AB Genomic medicine is moving from research to the clinic. There is a lack of evidence about the impact of genomic medicine interventions on health outcomes. This is due in part to a lack of standardized outcome measures that can be used across different programs to evaluate the impact of interventions targeted to specific genetic conditions. The eMERGE Outcomes working group (OWG) developed measures to collect information on outcomes following the return of genomic results to participants for several genetic disorders. These outcomes were compared to outcome intervention pairs for genetic disorders developed independently by the ClinGen Actionability working group (AWG). In general, there was concordance between the defined outcomes between the two groups. The ClinGen outcomes tended to be from a higher level and the AWG scored outcomes represented a subset of outcomes referenced in the accompanying AWG evidence review. eMERGE OWG outcomes were more detailed and discrete, facilitating a collection of relevant information from the health records. This paper demonstrates that common outcomes for genomic medicine interventions can be identified. Further work is needed to standardize outcomes across genomic medicine implementation projects and to make these publicly available to enhance dissemination and assist in making precision public health a reality.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this review is to outline the prevalence and significance of occipital headaches in children and how they relate to neuroimaging findings. We seek to evaluate the concern that occipital headaches in children are indicative of secondary headache pathology by reviewing the yield of neuroimaging in pediatric patients with occipital headache location.; RECENT FINDINGS: Occipital headaches are a common presentation of primary headache disorders in children, seen in 7-16% of children presenting for evaluation of headache and in up to 20% of children diagnosed with migraine in the emergency department. Review of recent literature confirms that in and of itself, occipital location of headache in a child with recurrent headache and a normal physical examination should not be regarded as worrisome. Headaches with associated signs on neurologic examination should be investigated for a secondary cause, regardless of headache location. Occipital headaches that do not meet criteria for a primary headache disorder should be evaluated for site-specific occipital headache conditions. Neuroimaging for recurrent headache in children who have normal neurological examinations has an overall low yield (0-4.1%) for actionable findings in recent studies. Importantly, an abnormal neurologic examination often predicts the presence of neuroimaging abnormalities. In the absence of an atypical history or abnormalities on clinical examination, occipital headaches in children are no more likely to be associated with intracranial pathology than headaches in other locations. If the child's headaches are otherwise consistent with migraine or another primary headache disorder, and the neurologic examination is normal, the yield of neuroimaging is low, and imaging can generally be deferred.

AB BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews are an important source of evidence for public health decision-making, but length and technical jargon tend to hinder their use. In non-English speaking countries, inaccessibility of information in the native language often represents an additional barrier. In line with our vision to strengthen evidence-based public health in the German-speaking world, we developed a German language summary format for systematic reviews of public health interventions and undertook user-testing with public health decision-makers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.; METHODS: We used several guiding principles and core elements identified from the literature to produce a prototype summary format and applied it to a Cochrane review on the impacts of changing portion and package sizes on selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco. Following a pre-test in each of the three countries, we carried out 18 user tests with public health decision-makers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland using the 'think-aloud' method. We analysed participants' comments according to the facets credibility, usability, understandability, usefulness, desirability, findability, identification and accessibility. We also identified elements that hindered the facile and satisfying use of the summary format, and revised it based on participants' feedback.; RESULTS: The summary format was well-received; participants particularly appreciated receiving information in their own language. They generally found the summary format useful and a credible source of information, but also signalled several barriers to a positive user experience such as an information-dense structure and difficulties with understanding statistical terms. Many of the identified challenges were addressed through modifications of the summary format, in particular by allowing for flexible length, placing more emphasis on key messages and relevance for public health practice, expanding the interpretation aid for statistical findings, providing a glossary of technical terms, and only including graphical GRADE ratings. Some barriers to uptake, notably the participants' wish for actionable recommendations and contextual information, could not be addressed.; CONCLUSIONS: Participants welcomed the initiative, but user tests also revealed their problems with understanding and interpreting the findings summarised in our prototype format. The revised summary format will be used to communicate the results of Cochrane reviews of public health interventions.

AB Objective: To investigate whether small endoscopic biopsies of colorectal cancer were sufficient for quality and accurate mutational analysis by amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: By using an amplicon-based targeted NGS panel for mutational detection on Illumina Miseq platform, a total of 109 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) endoscopic biopsies of colorectal cancer were retrospectively selected, based on specific histopathologic criteria, from January 2012 to June 2016 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University and Peking University Third Hospital. Twelve of these biopsies had corresponding FFPE surgical resection specimens. Quality control parameters of NGS testing were analyzed and NGS results were confirmed by other methods. Mutation calls of the 12 paired endoscopic biopsies and surgical resections were compared. Results: Of the endoscopic biopsy specimens, 97.2% (106/109) had sufficient DNA and qualified sequencing library. NGS generated excellent sequencing data, with a median of 848* for median read depth and 95.7% for uniformity. The success rate of NGS was 95.4% (104/109). Conventional methods confirmed the results of NGS for KRAS and BRAF, and the concordance rate was 100.0%. The clinically actionable mutations detected in the 12 paired endoscopic biopsies and surgical resections were concordant. Conclusion: FFPE endoscopic biopsies of colorectal cancer is suitable for targeted NGS, providing quality sequencing data and accurate mutational information to guide targeted therapy.

AB Precision oncology is now the evidence-based standard of care for the management of many advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Notably, new molecular profiling technologies have permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes including RET rearrangements. RET oncogenes cannot be adequately detected by immunohistochemistry, although fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing are complementary diagnostic tools. In the clinical setting, the benefit of the most developed RET inhibitors, i.e., cabozantinb, vandetanib and lenvatinb, in terms of response and median progressionfree survival has been demonstrated. The absence of striking clinical results of RET inhibitors underscores the clear need for development of more selective and potent RET inhibitors. This paper reviews the clinical data available on RET inhibitors in RET-associated NSCLC.

AB Background: In the traditional asthma management protocol, a child meets with a clinician infrequently, once in 3 to 6 months, and is assessed using the Asthma Control Test questionnaire. This information is inadequate for timely determination of asthma control, compliance, precise diagnosis of the cause, and assessing the effectiveness of the treatment plan. The continuous monitoring and improved tracking of the child's symptoms, activities, sleep, and treatment adherence can allow precise determination of asthma triggers and a reliable assessment of medication compliance and effectiveness. Digital phenotyping refers to moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in situ using data from personal digital devices, in particular, mobile phones. The kHealth kit consists of a mobile app, provided on an Android tablet, that asks timely and contextually relevant questions related to asthma symptoms, medication intake, reduced activity because of symptoms, and nighttime awakenings; a Fitbit to monitor activity and sleep; a Microlife Peak Flow Meter to monitor the peak expiratory flow and forced exhaled volume in 1 second; and a Foobot to monitor indoor air quality. The kHealth cloud stores personal health data and environmental data collected using Web services. The kHealth Dashboard interactively visualizes the collected data.; Objective: The objective of this study was to discuss the usability and feasibility of collecting clinically relevant data to help clinicians diagnose or intervene in a child's care plan by using the kHealth system for continuous and comprehensive monitoring of child's symptoms, activity, sleep pattern, environmental triggers, and compliance. The kHealth system helps in deriving actionable insights to help manage asthma at both the personal and cohort levels. The Digital Phenotype Score and Controller Compliance Score introduced in the study are the basis of ongoing work on addressing personalized asthma care and answer questions such as, "How can I help my child better adhere to care instructions and reduce future exacerbation?"; Methods: The Digital Phenotype Score and Controller Compliance Score summarize the child's condition from the data collected using the kHealth kit to provide actionable insights. The Digital Phenotype Score formalizes the asthma control level using data about symptoms, rescue medication usage, activity level, and sleep pattern. The Compliance Score captures how well the child is complying with the treatment protocol. We monitored and analyzed data for 95 children, each recruited for a 1- or 3-month-long study. The Asthma Control Test scores obtained from the medical records of 57 children were used to validate the asthma control levels calculated using the Digital Phenotype Scores.; Results: At the cohort level, we found asthma was very poorly controlled in 37% (30/82) of the children, not well controlled in 26% (21/82), and well controlled in 38% (31/82). Among the very poorly controlled children (n=30), we found 30% (9/30) were highly compliant toward their controller medication intake-suggesting a re-evaluation for change in medication or dosage-whereas 50% (15/30) were poorly compliant and candidates for a more timely intervention to improve compliance to mitigate their situation. We observed a negative Kendall Tau correlation between Asthma Control Test scores and Digital Phenotype Score as -0.509 (P<.01).; Conclusions: kHealth kit is suitable for the collection of clinically relevant information from pediatric patients. Furthermore, Digital Phenotype Score and Controller Compliance Score, computed based on the continuous digital monitoring, provide the clinician with timely and detailed evidence of a child's asthma-related condition when compared with the Asthma Control Test scores taken infrequently during clinic visits.

AB With the widespread adoption of molecular profiling in clinical oncology practice, many physicians are faced with making therapeutic decisions based upon isolated genomic alterations. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) while anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies are ineffective in Ras-mutant colorectal cancers. The matching of mutations with drugs aimed at their respective gene products represents the current state of "precision" oncology. Despite the great expectations of this approach, only a fraction of cancers responds to 'targeted' interventions, and many early responders will ultimately develop resistance to these agents. The underwhelming success of mutation-driven therapies across all cancer types is not due to an inability to detect genetic changes in tumors; rather a deficit in functional insight into the genomic alterations that give rise to each cancer. The Achilles heel of precision oncology thus remains the lack of a robust functional understanding of an individual cancer genome that then allows prediction of the best therapy and resultant outcome for that patient. Current practice focuses on one 'actionable' mutation at a time, while solid cancers typically possess many mutations that involve different cellular sub-populations within a tumor. No method or platform currently exists to guide the interpretation of these complex data, nor to accurately predict response to treatment. This problem is particularly germane to primary liver cancers (PLC), for which only a handful of targeted therapies have been introduced. Here, we will review strategies aimed at overcoming some of these challenges in precision oncology, using liver cancer as an example.

AB BACKGROUND: Detection of undiagnosed or undertreated ("actionable") atrial fibrillation could increase the use of appropriate oral anticoagulant therapy and reduce the risk of stroke. We sought to compare newer screening technologies with a pulse-check for the detection of atrial fibrillation and to determine whether the detection of actionable atrial fibrillation increases the use of oral anticoagulant agents.; METHODS: This prospective multicentre cohort study involved 22 primary care clinics. We recruited participants aged 65 years and older who were attending routine appointments. Each participant underwent 3 methods of screening: a 30-second radial pulse-check; single-lead electrocardiogram; and screening by blood pressure machine with atrial fibrillation detection algorithms. Participants who received a positive result on 1 or more test underwent 12-lead electrocardiogram with or withour 24-hour Holter. Screening tests were compared using the McNemar test. Participants with confirmed atrial fibrillation received follow-up at 90 days.; RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 73.7 (± 6.9) years, and 53.4% of participants were female. Of 2171 patients, we had data from all 3 screening tests for 2054 patients. Both single-lead electrocardiogram and the blood pressure device showed superior specificity compared with pulse-check (p < 0.001 for each). Fifty-six patients (2.7%) had confirmed atrial fibrillation: 12 patients had newly detected atrial fibrillation (none of the patients were using anticoagulation agents), and 44 patients had previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation (42 patients were receiving anticoagulant therapy, 2 were not). Thus, 14 patients had actionable atrial fibrillation (0.7%). By 90 days, 77% of patients with actionable atrial fibrillation had started anticoagulant therapy.; INTERPRETATION: Newer screening technologies showed superior specificity compared with a pulse-check. Screening detected undiagnosed or undertreated atrial fibrillation in 0.7% of participants, and 77% started appropriate anticoagulant therapy.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, no.

AB Even after making allowance for an unprecedented hype, it is an undeniable fact that, in the coming decade, deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will cause a paradigm shift in the delivery of healthcare. This paper will review the practical utility of AI in neurosciences from a clinician's perspective. Steering clear of the complex, technical, computational jargon, the authors will critically review the exponential development in this area from a clinical standpoint. The reader will be exposed to the fundamentals of AI in healthcare and its applications in different areas of neurosciences. Powerful AI techniques can unlock clinically relevant information, hidden in massive amounts of data. Translating technical computational success to meaningful clinical impact is, however, a challenge. AI requires a thorough and systematic evaluation, prior to integration in the clinical care. Like other disruptive technologies in the past, its potential for causing a great impact should not be underestimated. A scenario in which medical information, gathered at the point of care, is analyzed using sophisticated machine algorithms to provide real-time actionable analytics seems to be within touching distance.

AB Pediatric brain tumors cause more deaths than any other childhood malignancy, and the identification of potentially actionable genomic alterations in this rare heterogeneous group of tumors may improve treatment and outcome. The genetic landscape of common posterior fossa tumors has been described in the past several years, yet the classification of malignant pediatric supratentorial tumors remains controversial. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a promising tool to evaluate multiple genes concurrently. The clinical utility of NGS has not been proven in pediatric brain tumors. We identified patients diagnosed with high-grade supratentorial pediatric brain tumors resected between 2008 and 2012 at our institution. DNA from 12 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 9 patients was analyzed, including 3 paired samples from diagnosis and relapse. A panel of 194 cancer-related genes was sequenced using targeted next-generation deep sequencing. Genetic findings were correlated with histology, immunohistochemistry, treatment, and survival. We found one or more pathologic genetic change (mutation, amplification, or deletion) in 8 of 9 (89%) of patients studied. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR) mutations were found in 3 patients, 2 of which had an exon 20 insertion not previously described in pediatric malignancy. Additional genetic changes were found in EGFR and Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha ( PDGFRA) at relapse not present in the initial samples. Familial cancer predisposition syndromes were suggested by mutations found in 3 genes in 4 patients, including TP53, MSH2, and CHEK2. Seven of 9 patients in this study died of their disease. In summary, targeted deep sequencing may be used in rare pediatric brain tumors to identify driver mutations for targeted therapy, suggest constitutional and familial testing for cancer predisposition syndromes, and select molecular targets worthy of further study.

AB BACKGROUND: Carcinosarcomas of the gynecologic tract, also known as malignant mixed Mullerian tumors, are aggressive neoplasms with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor.; RESULTS: Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components.; CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant value in a number of other malignant tumors.

AB Despite the broad literature base on factor analysis best practices, research seeking to evaluate a measure's psychometric properties frequently fails to consider or follow these recommendations. This leads to incorrect factor structures, numerous and often overly complex competing factor models and, perhaps most harmful, biased model results. Our goal is to demonstrate a practical and actionable process for factor analysis through (a) an overview of six statistical and psychometric issues and approaches to be aware of, investigate, and report when engaging in factor structure validation, along with a flowchart for recommended procedures to understand latent factor structures; (b) demonstrating these issues to provide a summary of the updated Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) factor models and a rationale for validation; and (c) conducting a comprehensive statistical and psychometric validation of the PCL-5 factor structure to demonstrate all the issues we described earlier. Considering previous research, the PCL-5 was evaluated using a sample of 1,403 U.S. Air Force remotely piloted aircraft operators with high levels of battlefield exposure. Previously proposed PCL-5 factor structures were not supported by the data, but instead a bifactor model is arguably more statistically appropriate.

AB OBJECTIVE: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a severe, life-threatening disorder for which early diagnosis is essential. However, given the rarity of the disease and non-specificity of symptoms, correct diagnosis may be delayed or missed. While various hematologic guidelines note common signs and symptoms associated with PNH, international expert consensus based on real-world clinical experience and an actionable algorithm for non-specialists to facilitate screening and diagnosis are lacking. The objective of the study is to develop a clinically relevant, consensus-driven screening and diagnostic algorithm on PNH for non-specialist clinicians.; METHODS: An expert advisory committee of PNH experts from North America, Europe, and Japan was convened, and a modified Delphi methodology was employed to develop an algorithm to assist non-specialist clinicians in identifying signs/symptoms of PNH and conducting appropriate differential diagnosis. Twelve globally representative Delphi panelists with clinical expertise in PNH were identified and recruited. Panelists provided their differential diagnosis for 5 blinded case studies via 2 rounds of online questionnaires. Responses mentioned by >50% of panelists in the first round were included in the second-round questionnaire, at which point consensus was attained if >80% of panelists agreed on an approach.; RESULTS: Consensus was reached for 95% of screening and diagnostic decision points and 90% of tests required at decision points.; CONCLUSION: These results facilitated development of a consensus-based, clinically relevant algorithm, providing non-specialist clinicians with actionable guidance on PNH screening and diagnosis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB BACKGROUND: Providers need timely, clinically meaningful, and actionable information to improve quality of care. Payers may play an important role in providing such information in ambulatory care settings. We sought to learn about providers' use and perceptions of quality reports from insurers.; METHODS: We employed a mixed-methods study design. We analyzed the performance of 118 provider groups on 21 HEDIS measures included in one New England insurer's quality reporting program and evaluated how a subset of provider groups (n = 55) accessed the reports. We also conducted 14 semistructured interviews with providers and administrators to assess their perspectives about quality reports from insurers in general.; RESULTS: Performance on quality measures varied greatly across provider groups and by metric. Only 20% of provider groups accessed the quality reports during the study period. While providers reported that payer information on quality has the potential to be useful, respondents suggested important reasons why insurer quality reports were not widely accessed, including information overload, conflicts with other sources of information, and the significant provider effort required to make the reports actionable.; CONCLUSIONS: Payer-provider collaborations are needed to improve the usefulness of payers' quality measurement reports, and coordination among payers is needed to streamline reported measures.

AB Once an incidental finding (IF) is discovered in the course of genomic research, the researchers are faced with the question of whether or not that finding should be reported back to the study participant. A large number of hypothetical studies and policy documents on this issue have been published, but there are very few empirical studies to inform the bioethics debate. Within a biobank research study of somatic mutations in breast carcinomas, ten germline BRCA1/2 mutations were incidentally detected. After thorough discussions within a group of experts, the mutation carriers (n=7) or relatives of deceased carriers (n=3) were re-contacted and informed about the findings. Eight out of ten accepted to receive the information and underwent confirmatory testing. One year later, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with three of the study participants. All of them felt that BRCA mutations discovered in the course of research should be reported back to the individual study participants. In this paper, we report our step-by-step experiences of the re-contacting process. We hope that our detailed reporting will be helpful for other researchers and clinicians that are faced with similar situations. The results of our study lend empirical support to opinion that IFs that meet the three baseline criteria of analytic validity, clinical significance, and actionability should be reported back to the individual study participants.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables parallel analysis of multiple genomic targets. The increasing demand for NGS-based multiplexed molecular diagnostics requires standardized protocols and recommendations to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of test results for routine clinical decision making. However, the lack of clinical NGS data from multi-laboratory tests and the absence of inter-laboratory comparisons have hampered the establishment of instructive clinical NGS standards. To fill the gap, we set up Proficiency Testing (PT) for inter-laboratory comparison, in which formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from eight lung and eight colon cancers were analyzed by 15 European molecular diagnostic laboratories on three different platforms using multiple target enrichment systems. We first performed platform, test, and informatics pipeline validation and conducted sensitivity and specificity analysis by random in silico down-sampling. We then implemented a multi-level filtering strategy based on performance tests of base substitution, replicate runs, and Sanger sequencing verified variants. We finally applied the filter criteria to the NGS data from the respective PT participants and obtained high inter-laboratory agreement. We demonstrated accuracy, scalability, and robustness of NGS by means of PT, serving as a benchmark for detecting clinically actionable molecular alterations in research and diagnostic laboratories. In conclusion, this study strongly highlights the importance of establishing standards for NGS-based testing, particularly when the test results impact on clinical decisions, and systematically provides data sets from multiple different labs to infer such standards.

AB Increased awareness, interest and use of assistive technology (AT) presents substantial opportunities for many citizens to become, or continue being, meaningful participants in society. However, there is a significant shortfall between the need for and provision of AT, and this is patterned by a range of social, demographic and structural factors. To seize the opportunity that assistive technology offers, regional, national and sub-national assistive technology policies are urgently required. This paper was developed for and through discussion at the Global Research, Innovation and Education on Assistive Technology (GREAT) Summit; organized under the auspices of the World Health Organization's Global Collaboration on Assistive Technology (GATE) program. It outlines some of the key principles that AT polices should address and recognizes that AT policy should be tailored to the realities of the contexts and resources available. AT policy should be developed as a part of the evolution of related policy across a number of different sectors and should have clear and direct links to AT as mediators and moderators for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The consultation process, development and implementation of policy should be fully inclusive of AT users, and their representative organizations, be across the lifespan, and imbued with a strong systems-thinking ethos. Six barriers are identified which funnel and diminish access to AT and are addressed systematically within this paper. We illustrate an example of good practice through a case study of AT services in Norway, and we note the challenges experienced in less well-resourced settings. A number of economic factors relating to AT and economic arguments for promoting AT use are also discussed. To address policy-development the importance of active citizenship and advocacy, the need to find mechanisms to scale up good community practices to a higher level, and the importance of political engagement for the policy process, are highlighted. Policy should be evidence-informed and allowed for evidence-making; however, it is important to account for other factors within the given context in order for policy to be practical, authentic and actionable. Implications for Rehabilitation The development of policy in the area of asssitive technology is important to provide an overarching vision and outline resourcing priorities. This paper identifies some of the key themes that should be addressed when developing or revising assistive technology policy. Each country should establish a National Assistive Technology policy and develop a theory of change for its implementation.

AB Germline CHEK2 mutations confer increased cancer risk, for breast and other types, which is variable depending on the specific mutation. Of these, Large Genomic Rearrangements (LGRs) have been rarely reported; to date only eight LGRs have been published with just the Czech founder mutation, the deletion of exons 9 and 10, being molecularly characterized and studied extensively. The present study aimed to molecularly define and determine the contribution of two rare, apparently novel CHEK2 LGRs, among Greek breast cancer patients. These specifically involve a ~6kb in-frame deletion of exons 2 & 3 that removes CHEK2's FHA domain and a ~7.5kb in-frame deletion of exon 6, which removes an alpha-helix of CHEK2's kinase domain. The latter was identified in 5 out of 2355 (0.22%) patients tested, while haplotype analysis revealed a common disease-associated haplotype, suggesting a single common ancestor and a Greek founder. Although in-frame, this LGR is predicted to be damaging by a yeast-based functional assay and structure-function predictions. The present study highlights the existence of rare, population-specific, genomic events in a known breast cancer predisposing gene, which can explain a proportion of hereditary breast cancer. Identification of such mutation carriers is rather important since appropriate clinical actionability will be inferred.

AB CONTEXT: Social media is becoming increasingly integrated into disaster response communication strategies of public health and emergency response agencies.; OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the content, accessibility, and dissemination of social media communications made by government agencies during a disaster response.; DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of social media posts made by federal, state, and local government, public health and emergency management agencies before, during, and after the 2016 Louisiana floods was conducted to determine their content, accessibility, and dissemination by level of government and time relative to disaster onset.; SETTING: Facebook and/or Twitter posts made by public agencies involved in the response to the 2016 Louisiana Flooding events (FEMA Disaster Declaration [DR-4277]) published between August 4 and September 16, 2016, publicly available online between February 21 and March 31, 2017, were included in the analysis.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Content: The text of each post was assessed to determine whether it contained information on provision of situational awareness; addressing misconception, actionable requests; mental, behavioral, and emotional support; and/or recovery and rebuilding resources. Accessibility: A Flesh-Kincaid grade level of each post was calculated, and information on post language, originality, hyperlinks, visuals, videos, or hash tag was recorded. Dissemination: The average number of reacts/likes, shares/retweets, and comments per post was calculated.; RESULTS: Most posts contained information related to situational awareness and recovery resources. There was an increase in messages during the first week of the disaster at all levels. Few posts were made in languages other than English. Compared with state and federal posts, local Facebook posts averaged fewer reacts, comments, and shares throughout the analysis period.; CONCLUSIONS: Government agencies may maximize the use of social media platforms for disaster communications by establishing their social media network in advance of a disaster and by applying established guidelines on disaster social media use.

AB BACKGROUND: Gastric adenocarcinoma is a heterogenous disease that results from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors, which may contribute to the disparate outcomes observed between different patient populations. This study aimed to determine whether genomic differences exist in a diverse population of patients by evaluating tumor mutational profiles stratified by race.; METHODS: All patients with gastric adenocarcinoma between 2012 and 2016 who underwent targeted next-generation sequencing of cancer genes by the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets platform were identified. Patient race was categorized as Asian, African American, Hispanic, or Caucasian. Fisher's exact test was used to examine differences in mutation rates between racial designations for the most common mutations identified. The p values in this study were adjusted using the false discovery rate method.; RESULTS: The study investigated 595 mutations in 119 patients. The DNA alterations identified included missense mutations (66%), frame-shift deletions (13%), and nonsense mutations (9%). Silent mutations were excluded. The most frequently mutated genes were ARID1A, CDH1, ERBB3, KRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53. Of these, TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene, affecting 50% of patients. The proportion of patients with TP53 mutations differed significantly between races (p=0.012). The findings showed TP53 mutations for 89% (16/18) of the African American patients, 56% (10/18) of the Asian patients, 43% (9/21) of the Hispanic patients, and 40% (25/62) of the Caucasian patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher rates of TP53 mutations were identified among the African American patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. This is the first study to evaluate tumor genomic differences in a diverse population of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.

AB OBJECTIVES: In Germany, rehabilitative healthcare institutions increasingly rely on migrant physicians to meet their staffing needs. Yet until now, research on the integration of migrant physicians has focussed entirely on the acute care setting. This study is the first to address the specific advantages and challenges to integration in the field of rehabilitative medicine where a high number of migrant physicians work. From the experiences of migrant physicians and their colleagues, we provide actionable suggestions to counteract potential sources of conflict and thereby improve the integration of migrant physicians in the German workforce.; STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative interview study.; METHODS: We conducted 23 interviews with a total of 26 participants occupying a variety of roles in two different rehabilitation centres (maximum variation sampling). Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and parsed through thematic analysis.; RESULTS: Our research revealed advantages and challenges to integration in three distinct areas: rehabilitative care institutions, competencies of migrant professionals and interpersonal relations. The first set of issues hinges on the work processes within rehabilitative hospitals, professional prospects there and the location of the institutions themselves. Second, migrant physicians may encounter difficulties because of limited linguistic skills and country-specific knowledge. And finally, aspects of their interactions with care teams and patients may constitute barriers to integration.; CONCLUSIONS: Some of the factors influencing the integration of migrant physicians are the same in both rehabilitative and acute medicine, but the rehabilitative setting presents distinct advantages and challenges that are worthy of study in their own right. We outline several measures which could help overcome challenges to the integration of migrant physicians, including those associated with professional relationships. Further research is needed to develop concrete support programmes. Copyright © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Immunotherapy targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway has emerged as an effective treatment for lung cancer patients. It is important to evaluate the practicality of PD-L1 testing in real-world practice. A total of 211 non-small cell lung cancer patients were enrolled to detect 5 driver mutations and PD-L1 status (22C3 and SP263 assays) and to evaluate the characteristics of PD-L1 expression and its predictive value of immunotherapy. The PD-L1 positive (≥1%) and strong positive (≥50%) rate by SP263 assay was 27.0% and 12.8%. The concordance rates between 2 PD-L1 assays while using 1%, 10%, 25%, and 50% positive tumor cells as the cutoffs were 76.8%, 81.5%, 90.5%, and 94.3%, respectively. Smokers and patients without known actionable driver mutation were more likely to present strong positive PD-L1 [adjusted hazard ratio, 5.00 (95% confidence interval-CI, 1.60-15.64); P=0.006 and 3.59 (95% CI, 1.25-10.33); P=0.018, respectively]. Higher levels of smoking were associated with higher PD-L1 expressions. None of the EGFR, ALK, HER2, or BRAF-mutant nonsmokers displayed strong positive PD-L1 expression by SP263 assay. Among patients undergoing PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors therapy, high PD-L1 expression by SP263 was associated with a longer progression-free survival [adjusted hazard ratio, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03-0.71); P=0.017]. In conclusion, our results suggest that PD-L1 status remains an important predictor of immunotherapy efficacy. The concordance between 22C3 and SP263 assays was greater at a higher cutoff level of positivity. Patients without known actionable driver mutation, along with smokers, particularly those having high smoking pack-years, were more likely to have strong PD-L1 expression.

AB BACKGROUND: Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in newborn screening (NBS) could expand the number of genetic conditions detected pre-symptomatically, simultaneously challenging current precedents, raising ethical concerns, and extending the role of parental decision-making in NBS. The NC NEXUS (Newborn Exome Sequencing for Universal Screening) study seeks to assess the technical possibilities and limitations of NGS-NBS, devise and evaluate a framework to convey various types of genetic information, and develop best practices for incorporating NGS-NBS into clinical care. The study is enrolling both a healthy cohort and a cohort diagnosed with known disorders identified through recent routine NBS. It uses a novel age-based metric to categorize a priori the large amount of data generated by NGS-NBS and interactive online decision aids to guide parental decision-making. Primary outcomes include: (1) assessment of NGS-NBS sensitivity, (2) decision regret, and (3) parental decision-making about NGS-NBS, and, for parents randomized to have the option of requesting them, additional findings (diagnosed and healthy cohorts). Secondary outcomes assess parents' reactions to the study and to decision-making.; METHODS/DESIGN: Participants are parents and children in a well-child cohort recruited from a prenatal clinic and a diagnosed cohort recruited from pediatric clinics that treat children with disorders diagnosed through traditional NBS (goal of 200 children in each cohort). In phase 1, all parent participants use an online decision aid to decide whether to accept NGS-NBS for their child and provide consent for NGS-NBS. In phase 2, parents who consent to NGS-NBS are randomized to a decision arm or control arm (2:1 allocation) and learn their child's NGS-NBS results, which include conditions from standard (non-NGS) NBS plus other highly actionable childhood-onset conditions. Parents in the decision arm use a second decision aid to make decisions about additional results from their child's sequencing. In phase 3, decision arm participants learn additional results they have requested. Online questionnaires are administered at up to five time points.; DISCUSSION: NC NEXUS will use a rigorous interdisciplinary approach designed to collect rich data to inform policy, practice, and future research.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02826694 .

AB Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is an extremely rare soft tissue sarcoma, marked by a translocation involving the NR4A3 gene. EMC is usually indolent and moderately sensitive to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Recently, we reported on the therapeutic activity of sunitinib in a series of EMC cases, however the molecular target of sunitinib in EMC is unknown. Moreover, there is still the need to identify alternative therapeutic strategies. To better characterize this disease, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing in five EMC cases. Peculiarly, in one sample, an in-frame deletion (c.1735_1737delGAT p.D579del) was identified in exon 11 of KIT. The deletion was somatic and heterozygous and was validated both at DNA and mRNA level. This sample showed a marked high expression of KIT at the mRNA level and a mild phosphorylation of the receptor. Sanger sequencing of KIT in additional 15 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) EMC did not show any other mutated cases. In conclusion, exon 11 KIT mutation was detected only in one out of 20 EMC cases analyzed, indicating that KIT alteration is not a recurrent event in these tumors and cannot explain the EMC sensitivity to sunitinib, although it is an actionable mutation in the individual case in which it has been identified.

AB Gallbladder cancer is a rare malignancy of the biliary tract with a poor prognosis, frequently presenting at an advanced stage. While rare in the United States overall, gallbladder cancer has an elevated incidence in geographically distinct locations of the globe including Chile, North India, Korea, Japan and the state of New Mexico in the United States. People with Native American ancestry have a much elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations of New Mexico. Gallbladder cancer is also one of the few bi-gendered cancers with an elevated female incidence compared to men. Similar to other gastrointestinal cancers, gallbladder cancer etiology is likely multi-factorial involving a combination of genomic, immunological, and environmental factors. Understanding the interplay of these unique epidemiological factors is crucial in improving the prevention, early detection, and treatment of this lethal disease. Previous studies have failed to identify a distinct genomic mutational profile in gallbladder cancers, however, work to identify promising clinically actionable targets is this form of cancer is ongoing. Examples include, interest in the HER2/Neu signaling pathway and the recognition that chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in gallbladder cancer pathogenesis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of gallbladder cancer epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and treatment with a specific focus on the rural and Native American populations of New Mexico. We conclude this review by discussing future research directions with the goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients of this lethal malignancy.

AB BACKGROUND: The variety of alarms from all types of medical devices has increased from 6 to 40 in the last three decades, with today's most critically ill patients experiencing as many as 45 alarms per hour. Alarm fatigue has been identified as a critical safety issue for clinical staff that can lead to potentially dangerous delays or nonresponse to actionable alarms, resulting in serious patient injury and death. To date, most research on medical device alarms has focused on the nonactionable alarms of physiological monitoring devices. While there have been some reports in the literature related to drug library alerts during the infusion pump programing sequence, research related to the types and frequencies of actionable infusion pump alarms remains largely unexplored.; OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study protocol are to establish baseline data related to the types and frequency of infusion pump alarms from the B. Braun Outlook 400ES Safety Infusion System with the accompanying DoseTrac Infusion Management Software.; METHODS: The most recent consecutive 60-day period of backup hospital data received between April 2014 and February 2017 from 32 United States-based hospitals will be selected for analysis. Microsoft SQL Server (2012 - 11.0.5343.0 X64) will be used to manage the data with unique code written to sort data and perform descriptive analyses. A validated data management methodology will be utilized to clean and analyze the data. Data management procedures will include blinding, cleaning, and review of existing infusion data within the DoseTrac Infusion Management Software databases at each hospital. Patient-identifying data will be removed prior to merging into a dedicated and secure data repository. This pooled data will then be analyzed.; RESULTS: This exploratory study will analyze the aggregate alarm data for each hospital by care area, drug infused, time of day, and day of week, including: overall infusion pump alarm frequency (number of alarms per active infusion), duration of alarms (average, range, median), and type and frequency of alarms distributed by care area.; CONCLUSIONS: Infusion pump alarm data collected and analyzed in this study will be used to help establish a baseline of infusion pump alarm types and relative frequencies. Understanding the incidences and characteristics of infusion pump alarms will result in more informed quality improvement recommendations to decrease and/or modify infusion pump alarms, and potentially reduce clinical staff alarm fatigue and improve patient safety..; REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER: RR1-10.2196/10446. ©Kevin R Glover, Rachel R Vitoux, Catherine Schuster, Christopher R Curtin.

AB p53 missense mutant alleles are present in nearly 40% of all human tumors. Such mutated alleles generate aberrant proteins that not only lose their tumor-suppressive functions but also frequently act as driver oncogenes, which promote malignant progression, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance, leading to reduced survival in patients and mice. Notably, these oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) missense mutant p53 proteins (mutp53) are constitutively and tumor-specific stabilised. This stabilisation is one key pre-requisite for their GOF and is largely due to mutp53 protection from the E3 ubiquitin ligases Mdm2 and CHIP by the HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery. Recent mouse models provide convincing evidence that tumors with highly stabilized GOF mutp53 proteins depend on them for growth, maintenance, and metastasis, thus creating exploitable tumor-specific vulnerabilities that markedly increase lifespan if intercepted. This identifies mutp53 as a promising cancer-specific drug target. This review discusses direct mutp53 protein-targeting drug strategies that are currently being developed at various preclinical levels.

AB Developing a diagnostic tool within the diagnostic measurement framework is the optimal approach to obtain multidimensional and classification-based feedback on examinees. However, end users may seek to obtain diagnostic feedback from existing item responses to assessments that have been designed under either the classical test theory or item response theory frameworks. Retrofitting diagnostic classification models to existing assessments designed under other psychometric frameworks could be a plausible approach to obtain more actionable scores or understand more about the constructs themselves. This study (a) discusses the possibility and problems of retrofitting, (b) proposes a step-by-step retrofitting framework, and (c) explores the information one can gain from retrofitting through an empirical application example. While retrofitting may not always be an ideal approach to diagnostic measurement, this article aims to invite discussions through presenting the possibility, challenges, process, and product of retrofitting.

AB Objective The aim of the present study was to identify online resources community members may access to inform themselves about their legal duties and rights in end-of-life decision making. Methods Resource mapping identified online resources that members of the public in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are likely to identify, and assessed the ease or difficulty in locating them. Resources were then critically analysed for accessibility of language and format using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Results Identified resources differed considerably based on whether search terms identified by community members or experts were used. Most resources focused on advance directives, enduring powers of attorney and substitute decision making. Relatively few provided information about legal duties (e.g. powers and responsibilities of substitute decision makers) or resolving conflict with health practitioners. Accessibility (understandability and actionability) of resource content varied. Conclusions Although numerous resources on end-of-life law are available online, community members may not be able to identify relevant resources or find resource content accessible. What is known about the topic? Research on participation by patients in decision making about their treatment has focused primarily on medical rather than legal knowledge. What does this paper add? The present study investigated which online resources community members may access to inform themselves about the law on end-of-life decision making. The resources identified were analysed for ease of location and content accessibility. What are the implications for practitioners? Authors of online resources on end-of-life decision making should consider whether their resources can be: (1) identified by search terms used by the public; (2) understood by a general audience; and (3) readily used to promote reader action.

AB There is a growing movement related to self-tracking in the quest for better health. Why do so many people like to use 'intelligent tools' like shiny sensors or mobile apps to keep an eye on every move? Do they really help us drive sustained healthy behavioral changes? Despite technological advances and product promises, we must remember that technology alone does not facilitate change to optimize health benefits. The purpose of the commentary is to pose the question: How 'health literate' do we have to be to reap the actionable health benefits of self-tracking? Research has revealed the prevalence of limited health literacy across the globe. Health literacy involves a complex set of inter-connected skills, including acting upon health information. This commentary puts attention on health literacy as an essential human tool to better equip people to overcome barriers and use devices to leverage their full potential.

AB Background: To confirm the feasibility and explore the clinical applicability of amplicon sequencing by next generation sequencing (NGS) of biopsy samples from patients with advanced solid tumors, we conducted a prospective study.; Methods: Patients with unresectable, advanced, or recurrent solid tumors were included. Key eligibility criteria were as follows: 20 years or older, any planned systemic therapy, adequate lesion for biopsy, and written informed consent. Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Cancer-derived DNA was extracted, and amplicon sequencing was performed using Ion AmpliseqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel version 1.0 or version 2.0 by central vendor. We evaluated the success rate of sequencing, and the proportion of the patients with actionable mutations. We organized an expert panel to share the results of targeted sequence, make annotations and reports, and discuss concomitant ethical/legal/social issues.; Results: A total of 232 patients were included, and 208 were successfully analyzed (success rate of 89.7%). The biopsy procedures were safe, with only one case of Grade 3 vasovagal reaction. The proportion of actionable/druggable mutations was 38.9% (81/208), which was not significantly different between the cancer panel version 1.0 and version 2.0 (P = 0.476). Expert panel could discuss the findings and make sufficient reports.; Conclusions: We confirmed the feasibility of NGS-based amplicon sequencing using biopsy samples, making the basis for nationwide genome screening for cancer patients using biopsy samples. Our results suggest that focused panel may be sufficient to detect major mutations.

AB INTRODUCTION: Feedback in clinical education and after simulated experiences facilitates learning. Although evidence-based guidelines for feedback exist, faculty experience challenges in applying the guidelines. We set out to explore how faculty approach feedback and how these approaches align with current recommendations.; METHODS: There is strong evidence for the following four components of feedback: feedback as a social interaction, tailoring content, providing specific descriptions of performance, and identifying actionable items. Faculty preceptors participated in feedback simulations followed by debriefing. The simulations were video recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively using template analysis to examine faculty approaches to feedback relative to evidence-informed recommendations.; RESULTS: Recorded encounters involving 18 faculty and 11 facilitators yielded 111 videos. There was variability in the extent to which feedback approaches aligned with recommended practices. Faculty behaviors aligned with recommendations included a conversational approach, flexibly adapting feedback techniques to resident context, offering rich descriptions of observations with specific examples and concrete suggestions, achieving a shared understanding of strengths and gaps early on to allow sufficient time for problem-solving, and establishing a plan for ongoing development. Behaviors misaligned with guidelines included prioritizing the task of feedback over the relationship, lack of flexibility in techniques applied, using generic questions that did not explore residents' experiences, and ending with a vague plan for improvement.; CONCLUSIONS: Faculty demonstrate variability in feedback skills in relation to recommended practices. Simulated feedback experiences may offer a safe environment for faculty to further develop the skills needed to help residents progress within competency-based medical education.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical performance of three-dimensional stereoscopic digital mammography (3DsDM) compared with two-dimensional digital mammography (2DDM) for breast lesion diagnosis with jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROC) observer study.; METHODS: 40 pairs of standard-dose 2DDM and their 3DsDM images were used for an observer performance study. A total of 18 lesions were identified as the reference standard of actionable breast lesions (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Category 3 or more) by two breast radiologists. Ratings and locations of "lesions" determined by observers were utilized for assessing the statistical significance of differences between eight radiologists' performances with the 2DDM images and with the 3DsDM images in jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis.; RESULTS: The average figure-of-merit values for all radiologists increased to a statistically significant degree, from 0.859 with the 2DDM images to 0.936 with the 3DsDM images (p < 0.001). The average sensitivity for detecting actionable lesions was improved from 74.3to 92.4% at a false-positive rate of 0.2 per case by use of the 3DsDM images. The mean reading time per case with 2DDM images was not significantly different from that with 3DsDM images.; CONCLUSION: The use of 3DsDM would improve the observer performance for breast lesion without considerably extending the reading time. Advances in knowledge: Use of 3DsDM improves radiologists' performance for breast lesion detection.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a promising approach for tumor somatic mutation detection. However, stringent validation is required for its application on clinical specimens, especially for low-quality formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Here, we validated the performance of an amplicon-based targeted NGS assay, OncoAim DNA panel, on both commercial reference FFPE samples and clinical FFPE samples of Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Then we profiled the mutation spectrum of 648 Chinese CRC patients in a multicenter study to explore its clinical utility. This NGS assay achieved 100% test specificity and 95-100% test sensitivity for variants with mutant allele frequency (MAF) ≥5% when median read depth ≥500*. The orthogonal methods including amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR and Sanger sequencing validated that NGS generated three false negatives (FNs) but no false positives (FPs) among 516 clinical samples for KRAS aberration detection. Genomic profiling of Chinese CRC patients with this assay revealed that 63.3% of the tumors harbored clinically actionable alterations. Besides the commonly mutated genes including TP53 (52.82%), KRAS (46.68%), APC (24.09%), PIK3CA (18.94%), SMAD4 (9.47%), BRAF (6.15%), FBXW7 (5.32%), and NRAS (4.15%), other less frequently mutated genes were also identified. Statistically significant association of specific mutated genes with certain clinicopathological features was detected, e.g., both BRAF and PIK3CA were more prevalent in right-side CRC (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). We concluded this targeted NGS assay is qualified for clinical practice, and our findings could help the diagnosis and prognosis of Chinese CRC patients.

AB Medical oncology is in need of a mathematical modeling toolkit that can leverage clinically-available measurements to optimize treatment selection and schedules for patients. Just as the therapeutic choice has been optimized to match tumor genetics, the delivery of those therapeutics should be optimized based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. Under the current approach to treatment response planning and assessment, there does not exist an efficient method to consolidate biomarker changes into a holistic understanding of treatment response. While the majority of research on chemotherapies focus on cellular and genetic mechanisms of resistance, there are numerous patient-specific and tumor-specific measures that contribute to treatment response. New approaches that consolidate multimodal information into actionable data are needed. Mathematical modeling offers a solution to this problem. In this perspective, we first focus on the particular case of breast cancer to highlight how mathematical models have shaped the current approaches to treatment. Then we compare chemotherapy to radiation therapy. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve chemotherapy treatments using the model of radiation therapy. We posit that mathematical models can improve the application of anticancer therapeutics in the era of precision medicine. By highlighting a number of historical examples of the contributions of mathematical models to cancer therapy, we hope that this contribution serves to engage investigators who may not have previously considered how mathematical modeling can provide real insights into breast cancer therapy.

AB Tacrolimus is effective for the prevention of acute rejection, but is also highly toxic and has great intra- and inter-individual variability in transplant patients. Genetic variation and other factors influence the response of an individual to tacrolimus treatment. Therefore, even if therapeutic drug monitoring is universally applied, rejection and toxicity still occur. Although the appropriate action on pharmacogenomic variability provides a cornerstone for the precise tacrolimus prescription, at present there are many obstacles to translating it into clinical practice. Pre-emptive genotyping is rarely performed because of practical and financial reasons. However, as the cost of sequencing continues to fall, it is feasible to span all clinically actionable genotypes and provide patients with relevant information throughout their lifetime, which would, therefore, optimize tacrolimus dosing by facilitating the structured dosing algorithms (for example, population pharmacokinetic models) and clinical decision support. In this review, we discuss the current challenges and opportunities for the translation of pharmacogenetic information of tacrolimus into clinical settings. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Most deaths occurring due to a surgical intervention happen postoperatively rather than during surgery. The current standard of care in many hospitals cannot fully cope with detecting and addressing post-surgical deterioration in time. For millions of patients, this deterioration is left unnoticed, leading to increased mortality and morbidity. Postoperative deterioration detection currently relies on general scores that are not fully able to cater for the complex post-operative physiology of surgical patients. In the last decade however, advanced risk and warning scoring techniques have started to show encouraging results in terms of using the large amount of data available peri-operatively to improve postoperative deterioration detection. Relevant literature has been carefully surveyed to provide a summary of the most promising approaches as well as how they have been deployed in the perioperative domain. This work also aims to highlight the opportunities that lie in personalizing the models developed for patient deterioration for these particular post-surgical patients and make the output more actionable. The integration of pre- and intra-operative data, e.g. comorbidities, vitals, lab data, and information about the procedure performed, in post-operative early warning algorithms would lead to more contextualized, personalized, and adaptive patient modelling. This, combined with careful integration in the clinical workflow, would result in improved clinical decision support and better post-surgical care outcomes.

AB In recent years, technologic advances have increased tremendously our understanding of the molecular characteristics and genetic drivers of a variety of brain tumors. These discoveries have led to paradigm shifts in the treatment of these tumor entities and may therefore have a considerable impact on the outcome of affected patients in the near future. Here, we provide a broad overview of recently discovered clinically actionable mutations that have been identified in three different primary brain tumors: gliomas, meningiomas, and craniopharyngiomas. We furthermore highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of these findings and summarize recently published and ongoing trials.

AB There has been a rapid uptick in the pace of oncology precision medicine advancements over the past several decades as a result of increasingly sophisticated technology and the ability to study more patients through innovative trial designs. As more precision oncology approaches are developed, the need for precision medicine trials is increasing in the community setting, where most patients with cancer are treated. However, community-based practices, as well as some academic centers, may face unique barriers to implementing precision medicine programs and trials within their communities. Such challenges include understanding the tissue needs of molecular tests (e.g., tumor, blood), identifying which molecular tests are best used and when tissue should be tested, interpreting the test results and determining actionability, understanding the role of genetic counseling and/or follow-up testing, determining clinical trial eligibility, and assessing patient attitudes and financial concerns. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance to community-based oncology practices currently conducting clinical trials who want to expand their research program to include precision medicine trials. Here, we describe the core components of precision medicine programs and offer best practices for successful implementation of precision medicine trials in community-based practices.

AB The last decade has seen substantial advances in androgen receptor targeting in prostate cancer. In addition, advances have been made in immunotherapy and radiopharmaceutical-based therapy, although their optimal use in the clinic remains unclear. Recent understanding of the relevance and actionability of DNA damage repair mutations in a considerable minority of patients with prostate cancer is likely to open up a new frontier in prostate cancer therapeutics. As androgen receptor-directed therapy moves earlier in the disease process for prostate cancer, advances in these nonandrogen receptor-based therapeutics may take on greater significance in the years to come.

AB The diffusion of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies has sustained massive parallel sequencing of tumor tissue providing a deep insight into tumor biology and advancement of personalized medicine. A substantial number of targeted agents have been investigated in gynecologic cancer and some have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, like PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer, bevacizumab in ovarian and cervical cancers, and pembrolizumab in microsatellite-unstable or mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancer. To improve effectiveness of targeted therapy, identification of predictive biomarkers able to guide the selection of the correct drug for the correct patient is crucial. Different limitations must be addressed to favor a more rapid implementation of a genotyping approach in treatment selection, such as the possibility to easily assess tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution along the disease trajectory and the need for innovative trial designs like adaptive or basket trials incorporating molecular features as selection criteria. A deep dive into the genomic features of exceptional responders may also favor better understanding of tumor biology, mechanism of action of a specific target agent, and identification or predictive biomarkers for subsequent tailored studies.

AB The practice of precision medicine for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly those patients with adenocarcinoma histology (the predominant subtype of NSCLC), has become the accepted standard of care worldwide. Implementation of prospective tumor molecular profiling and rational therapeutic decision-making based on the presence of recurrently detected oncogenic "driver" alterations in the tumor genome has revolutionized the way that lung cancer is diagnosed and treated in the clinic. Over the past two decades, there has been a deluge of therapeutically actionable driver alterations and accompanying small molecule inhibitors to target these drivers. Herein, we synthesize a large and rapidly growing body of literature regarding therapeutic inhibition of driver mutations. We focus on established targets, including EGFR, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET, HER2, and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK), with a particular emphasis on the sequencing of small molecule inhibitors in these genetically defined cohorts of patients with lung cancer.

AB Liquid biopsy has been used extensively in solid malignancies to detect actionable driver mutations, to monitor treatment response, to detect recurrence, to identify resistance mechanisms, and to prognosticate outcome. Although many liquid biopsy sequencing platforms are being used, only five test kits have received government approval. We review representative literature on these government-approved liquid biopsy kits, which are primarily used to detect EGFR mutation in lung cancer and RAS ( KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) mutations in colorectal carcinoma. Another emerging use of single-gene liquid biopsy is to detect PIK3CA mutations and to understand resistance to hormonal blockade in breast and prostate cancers. The two most commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) liquid biopsy tests (Guardant 360, Guardant Health; FoundationACT, Foundation Medicine Inc.) are discussed. The ability and the applicability of NGS platform to detect tumor mutation burden are also addressed. Finally, the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease may be the most important use of ctDNA in the setting of tumor heterogeneity. The ability to identify "shedders" and "nonshedders" of ctDNA may provide important insight into the clinicopathologic characteristics of the tumor and portend important prognostic significance regarding survival.

AB Despite efforts for extensive molecular characterization of cancer patients, such as the international cancer genome consortium (ICGC) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), the heterogeneous nature of cancer and our limited knowledge of the contextual function of proteins have complicated the identification of targetable genes. Here, we present Aberration Hub Analysis for Cancer (AbHAC) as a novel integrative approach to pinpoint aberration hubs, i.e. individual proteins that interact extensively with genes that show aberrant mutation or expression. Our analysis of the breast cancer data of the TCGA and the renal cancer data from the ICGC shows that aberration hubs are involved in relevant cancer pathways, including factors promoting cell cycle and DNA replication in basal-like breast tumors, and Src kinase and VEGF signaling in renal carcinoma. Moreover, our analysis uncovers novel functionally relevant and actionable targets, among which we have experimentally validated abnormal splicing of spleen tyrosine kinase as a key factor for cell proliferation in renal cancer. Thus, AbHAC provides an effective strategy to uncover novel disease factors that are only identifiable by examining mutational and expression data in the context of biological networks.

AB Mucoralean invasive fungal infections, while unusual among the general population, have a high mortality rate among immunocompromised individuals who become infected. They are also common spoilage organisms in cultured dairy products, some fresh produce, and baked goods. Additionally, Mucor and Rhizopus spp. are utilized in the production of traditional fermented foods including mold ripened cheeses and fermented soy products. The risk that consumption of these foods poses to immunocompromised consumers has been previously identified. However, actionable guidance on implementation of appropriate dietary restrictions and microbial specification targets for food manufacturers serving these populations is scarce and is limited by insufficient data regarding traceback analysis in cases of invasive fungal infections where food is the suspected transmission vector. Culture-dependent and molecular subtyping methods, including whole genome sequencing, will improve identification of the point source. In turn, the empirically determined information on root-cause can best direct the development of appropriate food safety policies and programs.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing attention to primary and secondary prevention of male infertility through modifiable lifestyle factors has gained traction amongst both patients and infertility specialists. In this review, the available evidence of modifiable lifestyle choices, specifically diet, physical activity, and body habitus, are evaluated.; RECENT FINDINGS: Studies examining diet, exercise/physical activity, and body habitus are characterized by conflicting conclusions, difficult confounders, and imperfect end points to judge male reproductive potential. However, convincing trends have emerged implicating consumption of saturated fats, pesticide exposure, high intensity exercise, and extremes of body mass index as detrimental to male fertility. Data assessing modifiable risk factors and subfertility in male partners has emphasized the notion of moderation. Balancing dietary fat, moderation of physical activity, and the management of a healthy body habitus favor both improvement of semen quality and birth outcomes. These observations provide actionable data for the reproductive urologist to better counsel men presenting with infertility.

AB In the fourth quarter of 2017, the US FDA reviewed and approved a request by one of the breast implant manufacturers for a change in the Directions for Use (DFU) that removed warnings regarding the use of Betadine (povidone-iodine [PI] 10% solution, 1% available iodine [Purdue Frederick Company, Stamford, CT], also available in generic formulations [Aplicare, Inc., Meriden, CT]). Previously, in 2000, there were concerns by the FDA that PI would degrade the silicone elastomer shell. This change in the DFU represents an important advance that will benefit patients through the permitted use of PI to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination of implant surfaces. What was formerly an off-label practice can be openly practiced by plastic surgeons as an anti-infective and biofilm-mitigation strategy. PI has an ideal spectrum effect for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive organisms have been linked to capsular contracture and gram-negative Ralstonia picketti to breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). R picketti is resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics, but it is susceptible to at least a 50% solution of PI. We believe that the strategy of antisepsis and biofilm mitigation is an integral part of a contemporary approach for breast augmentation. This is beneficial regarding reduction of the risk of surgical infection, capsular contracture, and BIA-ALCL. Outcome data so far indicate that antibiotics/anti-infectives seem to reduce the incidence of these adverse events that lead to reoperation and increased costs. It behooves plastic surgeons to take all actionable steps that enhance the quality of breast implant outcomes and reduce the rate of reoperation.

AB The natural cycle of landscape fire maintains the ecological health of the land, yet adverse health effects associated with exposure to emissions from wildfire produce public health and clinical challenges. Systematic reviews conclude that a positive association exists between exposure to wildfire smoke or wildfire particulate matter (PM2.5) and all-cause mortality and respiratory morbidity. Respiratory morbidity includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis and pneumonia. The epidemiological data linking wildfire smoke exposure to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity is mixed, and inconclusive. More studies are needed to define the risk for common and costly clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Susceptible populations include people with respiratory and possibly cardiovascular diseases, middle-aged and older adults, children, pregnant women and the fetus. The increasing frequency of large wildland fires, the expansion of the wildland-urban interface, the area between unoccupied land and human development; and an increasing and aging U.S. population are increasing the number of people at-risk from wildfire smoke, thus highlighting the necessity for broadening stakeholder cooperation to address the health effects of wildfire. While much is known, many questions remain and require further population-based, clinical and occupational health research. Health effects measured over much wider geographical areas and for longer periods time will better define the risk for adverse health outcomes, identify the sensitive populations and assess the influence of social factors on the relationship between exposure and health outcomes. Improving exposure models and access to large clinical databases foreshadow improved risk analysis facilitating more effective risk management. Fuel and smoke management remains an important component for protecting population health. Improved smoke forecasting and translation of environmental health science into communication of actionable information for use by public health officials, healthcare professionals and the public is needed to motivate behaviors that lower exposure and protect public health, particularly among those at high risk.

AB BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing technologies have been an increasingly critical aspect of precision medicine owing to a better identification of disease targets, which contributes to improved health care cost and clinical outcomes. In particular, disease-oriented targeted enrichment sequencing is becoming a widely-accepted application for diagnostic purposes, which can interrogate known diagnostic variants as well as identify novel biomarkers from panels of entire human coding exome or disease-associated genes.; RESULTS: We introduce a workflow named VAReporter to facilitate the management of variant assessment in disease-targeted sequencing, the identification of pathogenic variants, the interpretation of biological effects and the prioritization of clinically actionable targets. State-of-art algorithms that account for mutation phenotypes are used to rank the importance of mutated genes through visual analytic strategies. We established an extensive annotation source by integrating a wide variety of biomedical databases and followed the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for interpretation and reporting of sequence variations.; CONCLUSIONS: In summary, VAReporter is the first web server designed to provide a "one-stop" resource for individual's diagnosis and large-scale cohort studies, and is freely available at http://rnd.cgu.edu.tw/vareporter .

AB Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease that is resistant to most available therapeutics. Pancreatic cancer to date has no effective drugs that could enhance the survival of patients once their disease has metastasized. There is a need for the identification of novel actionable drug targets in this unusually recalcitrant cancer. Nuclear protein transport is an important mechanism that regulates the function of several tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) in a compartmentalization-dependent manner. High expression of the nuclear exporter chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1) or exportin 1 (XPO1), a common feature of several cancers including pancreatic cancer, results in excessive export of critical TSPs to the incorrect cellular compartment, leading to their functional inactivation. Small molecule inhibitors of XPO1 can block this export, retaining very important and functional TSPs in the nucleus and leading to the effective killing of the cancer cells. This review highlights the current knowledge on the role of XPO1 in pancreatic cancer and how this serves as a unique and clinically viable target in this devastating and by far incurable cancer.

AB Background: Molecular profiling of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential for therapeutic decision-making. Pleural effusion obtained by a non-invasive, repeatable procedure may provide an opportunity for molecular profiling and thereby possibly provide information enabling targeted therapy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of pleural effusion as a specimen for molecular analysis.; Methods: Thirty patients with paired malignant pleural effusion and thoracic biopsy specimens were included. Clinically actionable mutations were assessed using a validated targeted next generation sequencing assay. EGFR/KRAS/ALK mutation status in thoracic biopsy specimens was tested using ARMS PCR.; Results: The concordance rate between gene status identified by ARMS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis in the thoracic biopsy and pleural effusion samples was 86.7% (26/30). Compared with the thoracic biopsy specimens, the diagnostic performance of pleural effusion showed a sensitivity of 92.3%, a specificity of 50.0%, and a positive predictive value of 92.3%. Therefore, cases with a low percentage of tumor cells (<5%) can successfully be used to detect actionable mutations in pleural effusion specimens.; Conclusions: These results suggest that pleural effusions are suitable specimens for oncogene mutation analysis and enable targeted therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.

AB Intensive care units (ICUs) provide care to the most severely ill hospitalized patients. Although ICUs increasingly rely on interprofessional teams to provide critical care, little about actual teamwork in this context is well understood. The ICU team is typically comprised of physicians or intensivists, clinical pharmacists, respiratory therapists, dieticians, bedside nurses, clinical psychologists, and clinicians-in-training. ICU teams are distinguished from other health care teams in that they are low in temporal stability, which can impede important team dynamics. Furthermore, ICU teams must work in physically and emotionally challenging environments. Our review of the literature reveals the importance of information sharing and decision-making processes, and identifies potential barriers to successful team performance, including the lack of effective conflict management and the presence of multiple and sometimes conflicting goals. Key knowledge gaps about ICU teams include the need for more actionable data linking ICU team structure to team functioning and patient-, family-, ICU-, and hospital-level outcomes. In particular, research is needed to better delineate and define the ICU team, identify additional psychosocial phenomena that impact ICU team performance, and address varying and often competing indicators of ICU team effectiveness as a multivariate and multilevel problem that requires better understanding of the independent effects and interdependencies between nested elements (i.e., hospitals, ICUs, and ICU teams). Ultimately, efforts to advance team-based care are essential for improving ICU performance, but more work is needed to develop actionable interventions that ensure that critically ill patients receive the best care possible.

AB Health care systems are implementing a myriad of strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce both adverse events and unplanned readmissions. These approaches include interventions related to people, processes, and technology. This article describes the development of a technology-based model in the form of an actionable risk profile, which was used by one inpatient surgical unit (people) during a daily care team briefing (process). The risk profile was evaluated for its perceived value to the care team as a method of organizing care and anticipating patients' needs. Preliminary findings of the proof of concept are presented along with recommendations for practice and research.

AB Next-generation sequencing technology is of great importance for many biological disciplines; however, due to technical and biological limitations, the short DNA sequences produced by modern sequencers require numerous quality control (QC) measures to reduce errors, remove technical contaminants, or merge paired-end reads together into longer or higher-quality contigs. Many tools for each step exist, but choosing the appropriate methods and usage parameters can be challenging because the parameterization of each step depends on the particularities of the sequencing technology used, the type of samples being analyzed, and the stochasticity of the instrumentation and sample preparation. Furthermore, end users may not know all of the relevant information about how their data were generated, such as the expected overlap for paired-end sequences or type of adaptors used to make informed choices. This increasing complexity and nuance demand a pipeline that combines existing steps together in a user-friendly way and, when possible, learns reasonable quality parameters from the data automatically. We propose a user-friendly quality control pipeline called SHI7 (canonically pronounced "shizen"), which aims to simplify quality control of short-read data for the end user by predicting presence and/or type of common sequencing adaptors, what quality scores to trim, whether the data set is shotgun or amplicon sequencing, whether reads are paired end or single end, and whether pairs are stitchable, including the expected amount of pair overlap. We hope that SHI7 will make it easier for all researchers, expert and novice alike, to follow reasonable practices for short-read data quality control. IMPORTANCE Quality control of high-throughput DNA sequencing data is an important but sometimes laborious task requiring background knowledge of the sequencing protocol used (such as adaptor type, sequencing technology, insert size/stitchability, paired-endedness, etc.). Quality control protocols typically require applying this background knowledge to selecting and executing numerous quality control steps with the appropriate parameters, which is especially difficult when working with public data or data from collaborators who use different protocols. We have created a streamlined quality control pipeline intended to substantially simplify the process of DNA quality control from raw machine output files to actionable sequence data. In contrast to other methods, our proposed pipeline is easy to install and use and attempts to learn the necessary parameters from the data automatically with a single command.

AB PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the readability, understandability, suitability and actionability of online psoriasis patient educational materials. A secondary aim was to identify areas for improvement.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an evaluation study to assess online psoriasis patient educational materials from the American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis Foundation available in July 2017. We used two validated assessment tools specific to online healthcare materials. Outcomes were expressed as percentages, where higher percentages corresponded to higher quality materials.; RESULTS: Overall, the educational materials had a mean understandability score (72.7%) that was understandable; a suitability score (58.8%) that was adequate; a reading grade level (10.5) that was not readable; and an actionability score (54.7%) that was not actionable. Areas of improvement include reading grade level, visual aids, word choice, specific steps for actions and cultural appropriateness.; CONCLUSIONS: Online psoriasis patient educational materials are understandable and suitable, but they are written above the American Medical Association and National Institutes of Health's recommended 6th-8th grade reading level and are not actionable. Materials can benefit from decreasing reading grade level, including more visual elements, incorporating more actionable items and being culturally inclusive.

AB BACKGROUND: Secondary trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is uncommon. When a space-occupying lesion with mass effect is identified, the associated TN is often exclusively attributed to the tumor. This report illustrates the importance of considering coexistent actionable pathology when surgically treating secondary TN.; CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old woman presented with abrupt-onset TN of the V2 and V3 nerve divisions with hypesthesia. She denied changes in hearing, balance, or facial nerve dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.6-cm contrast-enhancing cerebellopontine angle tumor that effaced the trigeminal nerve, consistent with a vestibular schwannoma. In addition, a branch of the superior cerebellar artery abutted the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve on T2-weighted thin-slice magnetic resonance imaging. Intraoperative electrical stimulation of the tumor elicited a response from the facial nerve at low threshold over the entire accessible tumor surface, indicating that the tumor was a facial nerve schwannoma. Considering the patient's lack of facial nerve deficit and that the tumor exhibited no safe entry point for intracapsular debulking, tumor resection was not performed. Working between the tumor and tentorium, a branch of the superior cerebellar artery was identified and decompressed with a Teflon pad. At last follow-up, the patient exhibited resolution of her TN. Her hearing and facial nerve function remained intact.; CONCLUSIONS: Despite obstruction from a medium-sized tumor, it is still possible to achieve microvascular decompression of the fifthcranial nerve. This emphasizes the importance of considering other actionable pathology during surgical management of presumed tumor-induced TN. Further, TN is relatively uncommon withmedium-sized vestibular schwannomas and coexistent causes should be considered. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Diabetes is a major global epidemic and places a huge burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related hospitalizations are major contributors to this burden, and there is strong evidence that the risk for these can be reduced by early action to identify and prevent progression of people at high risk of T2D and ensure tight glycemic control in those with established disease. In response to this, the Berlin Declaration was developed by four working groups of experts and ratified by healthcare professionals from 38 countries. Its aim is to act as a global call to action for early intervention in diabetes, in addition to providing short-, medium- and long-term targets that should be relevant to all nations. The Berlin Declaration focuses on four aspects of early action, and proposes actionable policies relating to each aspect: early detection, prevention, early control and early access to the right interventions. In addition, a number of treatment targets are proposed to provide goals for these policies. To ensure that the suggested policies are enacted in the most effective manner, the support of specialist care professionals is considered essential. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB CONTEXT: Because of persistent effects of early childhood caries and impacts of dental health professional shortages areas, the integration of oral health in primary care settings is a public health priority. In this study, we explored oral health interprofessional practice (OHIP) as an integrative pathway to reduce oral health disparities. OHIP can include performing oral health risk assessments, describing the importance of fluoride in the drinking water, implementing fluoride varnish application, and referring patients to a dental home.; OBJECTIVE: To conduct a formative evaluation of how 15 pediatric primary care practices implemented the adoption of OHIP in their clinical settings.; DESIGN: Using an ecological framework, we conducted a qualitative process evaluation to measure the factors that inhibited and facilitated OHIP adoption into pediatric settings. Document review analysis and qualitative interviews were conducted with pediatric practices to contextualize challenges and facilitators to OHIP adoption.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 15 Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act pediatric practices located in 13 South Carolina counties participated in this study.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of interest were the facilitators and challenges of OHIP adoption into pediatric primary care practices.; RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed challenges for OHIP adoption including limited resources and capacity, role delineation for clinical and administrative staff, communication, and family receptiveness. OHIP training for clinical practitioners and staff and responsiveness from clinical staff and local dentists were facilitators of OHIP adoption. Twelve key recommendations emerged on the basis of participant experiences within OHIP, with developing an active dental referral network and encouraging buy-in from clinical staff for OHIP adoption as primary recommendations.; CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the effectiveness of a learning collaborative meeting among pediatric primary care providers to adopt OHIPs. This work reveals an actionable pathway to support oral health equity advancement for children through an additional access point of preventive oral care, reinforcement of positive oral health behaviors, and interaction between parent and child for overall health and wellness of the family.

AB PURPOSE: Genomic profiling of biopsied tissue is the basis for precision cancer therapy. However, biopsied materials may not contain sufficient amounts of tumor deoxyribonucleonic acid needed for the analysis. We propose a method to determine the adequacy of specimens for performing genomic profiling by quantifying their metabolic activity.; METHODS: We estimated the average density of tumor cells in biopsy specimens needed to successfully perform genomic analysis following the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) protocol from the minimum amount of deoxyribonucleonic acid needed and the volume of tissue typically used for analysis. The average 18 F-FDG uptake per cell was assessed by incubating HT-29 adenocarcinoma tumor cells in 18 F-FDG containing solution and then measuring their activity with a scintillation well counter. Consequently, we evaluated the response of two devices around the minimum expected activities which would indicate genomic profiling adequacy of biopsy specimens obtained under 18 F-FDG PET/CT guidance. Surrogate samples obtained using 18G core needle biopsies of gels containing either 18 F-FDG-loaded cells in the expected concentrations or the corresponding activity were measured using autoradiography and a scintillation well counter. Autoradiography was performed using a CCD-based device with real-time image display as well as with digital autoradiography imaging plates following a 30-min off-line protocol for specimen activity determination against previously established calibration.; RESULTS: Cell incubation experiments and estimates obtained from quantitative autoradiography of biopsy specimens (QABS) indicate that specimens acquired under 18 F-FDG PET/CT guidance that contained the minimum amount of cells needed for genomic profiling would have an average activity concentration in the range of about 3 to about 9 kBq/mL. When exposed to specimens with similar activity concentration, both a CCD-based autoradiography device and a scintillation well counter produced signals with sufficient signal-to-background ratio for specimen genomic adequacy identification in less than 10 min, which is short enough to allow procedure guidance.; CONCLUSION: Scintillation well counter measurements and CCD-based autoradiography have adequate sensitivity to detect the tumor burden needed for genomic profiling during 18 F-FDG PET/CT-guided 18G core needle biopsies of liver adenocarcinoma metastases. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: My Health Record (MyHR) is Australia's national electronic health record (EHR) system. Poor usability and functionality have resulted in low utility, affecting enrollment and participation rates by both patients and clinicians alike. Similar to apps on mobile phone app stores, innovative third-party applications of MyHR platform data can enhance the usefulness of the platform, but there is a paucity of research into the processes involved in developing third-party applications that integrate and use data from EHR systems.; OBJECTIVE: The research describes the challenges involved in pioneering the development of a patient and clinician Web-based software application for MyHR and insights resulting from this experience.; METHODS: This research uses a case study approach, investigating the development and implementation of Actionable Intime Insights (AI2), a third-party application for MyHR, which translates Medicare claims records stored in MyHR into a clinically meaningful timeline visualization of health data for both patients and clinicians. This case study identifies the challenges encountered by the Personal Health Informatics team from Flinders University in the MyHR third-party application development environment.; RESULTS: The study presents a nuanced understanding of different data types and quality of data in MyHR and the complexities associated with developing secondary-use applications. Regulatory requirements associated with utilization of MyHR data, restrictions on visualizations of data, and processes of testing third-party applications were encountered during the development of the application.; CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several processes, technical and regulatory barriers which, if addressed, can make MyHR a thriving ecosystem of health applications. It clearly identifies opportunities and considerations for the Australian Digital Health Agency and other national bodies wishing to encourage the development of new and innovative use cases for national EHRs. ©Niranjan Bidargaddi, Yasmin van Kasteren, Peter Musiat, Michael Kidd.

AB Unlike common epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutations that confer sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mutations in exon 20 of either EGFR or the human EGFR2 gene (HER2) are associated with insensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, with treatment options for patients with such mutations being limited. Clinical characteristics, outcome of EGFR-TKI or nivolumab treatment, and the presence of coexisting mutations were reviewed for NSCLC patients with exon-20 mutations of EGFR or HER2 as detected by routine application of an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing panel. Between July 2013 and June 2017, 206 patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer were screened for genetic alterations including HER2 and EGFR mutations. Ten patients harbored HER2 exon-20 insertions (one of whom also carried an exon-19 deletion of EGFR), and 12 patients harbored EGFR exon-20 mutations. Five of the 13 patients with EGFR mutations were treated with EGFR-TKIs, two of whom manifested a partial response, two stable disease, and one progressive disease. Among the seven patients treated with nivolumab, one patient manifested a partial response, three stable disease, and three progressive disease, with most (86%) of these patients discontinuing treatment as a result of disease progression within 4 months. The H1047R mutation of PIK3CA detected in one patient was the only actionable mutation coexisting with the exon-20 mutations of EGFR or HER2. Potentially actionable mutations thus rarely coexist with exon-20 mutations of EGFR or HER2, and EGFR-TKIs and nivolumab show limited efficacy in patients with such exon-20 mutations.

AB Investigating targeted therapies can be challenging due to diverse tumor mutations and slow patient accrual for clinical studies. The Signature Program is a series of 8 phase 2, agent-specific basket protocols using a rapid study start-up approach involving no predetermined study sites. Each protocol evaluated 1 agent (buparlisib, dovitinib, binimetinib, encorafenib, sonidegib, BGJ398, ceritinib, or ribociclib) in patients with solid or hematologic malignancies and an actionable mutation. The primary endpoint of each study was the clinical benefit rate (ie, complete or partial response, or stable disease) at 16 weeks. A total of 192 individual sites were opened in the United States, with a median start-up time of 3.6 weeks. The most common tumor types among the 595 treated patients were colorectal (9.2%), non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (9.1%), and ovarian (8.4%). Frequent genetic alterations were in PIK3CA, RAS, p16, and PTEN. Overall, 30 partial or complete responses were observed with 6 compounds in 16 tumor types. The Signature Program presents a unique and successful approach for rapid signal finding across multiple tumors and allowed various agents to be evaluated in patients with rare alterations. Incorporating these program features in conventional studies could lead to improved trial efficiencies and patient outcomes.

AB Brain metastases constitute a challenge in the management of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 systemic therapies. Here we sought to define the repertoire of mutations private to or enriched for in HER2-positive brain metastases. Massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 254 genes frequently mutated in breast cancers and/or related to DNA repair was used to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancers and their brain metastases in six patients. Data were analyzed with state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms and selected mutations were validated with orthogonal methods. Spatial and temporal inter-lesion genetic heterogeneity was observed in the HER2-positive brain metastases from an index patient subjected to a rapid autopsy. Genetic alterations restricted to the brain metastases included mutations in cancer genes FGFR2, PIK3CA and ATR, homozygous deletion in CDKN2A and amplification in KRAS. Shifts in clonal composition and the acquisition of additional mutations in the progression from primary HER2-positive breast cancer to brain metastases following anti-HER2 therapy were investigated in additional five patients. Likely pathogenic mutations private to or enriched in the brain lesions affected cancer and clinically actionable genes, including ATR, BRAF, FGFR2, MAP2K4, PIK3CA, RAF1 and TP53. Changes in clonal composition and the acquisition of additional mutations in brain metastases may affect potentially actionable genes in HER2-positive breast cancers. Our observations have potential clinical implications, given that treatment decisions for patients with brain metastatic disease are still mainly based on biomarkers assessed in the primary tumor.

AB Survival rates of pediatric sarcoma patients stagnated during the last two decades, especially in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Targeted therapies offer new options in refractory cases. Gene expression profiling provides a robust method to characterize the transcriptome of each patient's tumor and guide the choice of therapy. Twenty patients with refractory pediatric sarcomas (age 8-35 years) were assessed with array profiling: ten had Ewing sarcoma, five osteosarcoma, and five soft tissue sarcoma. Overexpressed genes and deregulated pathways were identified as actionable targets and an individualized combination of targeted therapies was recommended. Disease status, survival, adverse events (AEs), and quality of life (QOL) were assessed in patients receiving targeted therapy (TT) and compared to patients without targeted therapy (non TT). Actionable targets were identified in all analyzed biopsies. Targeted therapy was administered in nine patients, while eleven received no targeted therapy. No significant difference in risk factors between these two groups was detected. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were significantly higher in the TT group (OS: P=0.0014, PFS: P=0.0011). Median OS was 8.83 versus 4.93 months and median PFS was 6.17 versus 1.6 months in TT versus non TT group, respectively. QOL did not differ at baseline as well as at four week intervals between the two groups. TT patients had less grade 1 AEs (P=0.009). The frequency of grade 2-4 AEs did not differ. Overall, expression based targeted therapy is a feasible and likely beneficial approach in patients with refractory pediatric sarcomas that warrants further study.

AB International guidelines made RAS (KRAS and NRAS) status a prerequisite for the use of anti-EGFR agents for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Daily, new data emerges on the theranostic and prognostic role of molecular biomarkers; this is a strong incentive for a validated, sensitive, and broadly available molecular screening test. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has begun to supplant other technologies for genomic profiling. We report here our 2 years of clinical practice using NGS results to guide therapeutic decisions. The Ion Torrent AmpliSeq colon/lung cancer panel, which allows mutation detection in 22 cancer-related genes, was prospectively used in clinical practice (BELAC ISO 15189 accredited method). The DNA of 741 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC tissues, including primary tumors and metastasis, was obtained from 14 different Belgian institutions and subjected to targeted NGS. Of the tumors tested, 98% (727) were successfully sequenced and 89% (650) harbored at least one mutation. KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutations were found in 335 (46%), 78 (11%) and 32 (4%) samples, respectively. These mutation frequencies were consistent with those reported in public databases. Moreover, mutations and amplifications in potentially actionable genes were identified in 464 samples (64%), including mutations in PIK3CA (14%), ERBB2 (0.4%), AKT1 (0.6%), and MAP2K1 (0.1%), as well as amplifications of ERBB2 (0.3%) and EGFR (0.3%). The median turnaround time between reception of the sample in the laboratory and report release was 8 calendar days. Overall, the AmpliSeq colon/lung cancer panel was successfully applied in daily practice and provided reliable clinically relevant information for CRC patients.

AB Primary resistant Hodgkin lymphoma is an aggressive disease with few treatment options and short survival. Neoplastic cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma are heavily dependent on microenvironmental stimuli, regularly express PD-L1, and a relevant proportion of relapsed patients is sensitive to blocking of the PD1/PD-L1 axis. However, response duration is limited and further treatment options are unknown but urgently needed. We report a case of a patient without relevant response to five subsequent chemotherapy regimens who immediately and dramatically responded to an anti-PD1 mab. During the following two years she responded to the anti-CTLA-4 mab ipilimumab, the Jak2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, and a combination of lenalidomide plus cyclophosphamide given in subsequent relapses. A thorough genomic analysis demonstrated seven genomic alterations with six of them not previously described in this disease (i.e. BRIP1 G212fs*62, KRAS L19F, KDM5A R1239W, MYC A59T, ARIDA1A E1683fs*15 and TP53 277Y). Three alterations were considered actionable and one of them drugable. The number of mutations increased over time and the BRIP1 mutation was found to be a germline mutation.

AB BACKGROUND: Improvement in genetic characterization of Colon Cancer (CC) patients is required to propose new potential targets, since surgical resection coupled to chemotherapy, presents several limits such as cancer recurrence and drug resistance. Targeted therapies have more efficacy and less toxicity than standard treatments. One of the most relevant cancer-specific actionable targets are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) whose role in CC need to be better investigated.; METHODS: We have analysed 37 CC patients using the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel (CCP). We have confirmed the somatic nature of RET variants through Sanger sequencing and assessed RET activation status and protein expression by immunofluorescence and western-blot analyses. We have used RET mutant expression vectors to evaluate the effect of selected mutations in HEK293 cells by performing proliferation, migration and clonogenic assays.; RESULTS: Among the 409 cancer-related genes included in the CCP we have focused on the RTKs. Overall, we have observed 101 different potentially damaging variants distributed across 31 RTK genes in 28 patients. The most frequently mutated RTKs were FLT4, ROS1, EPH7, ERBB2, EGFR, RET, FGFR3 and FGFR4. In particular, we have identified 4 different somatic variants in 10% of CC patients in RET proto-oncogene. Among them, we have demonstrated that the G533C variant was able to activate RET by promoting dimer formation and enhancing Y1062 phosphorylation. Moreover, we have demonstrated that RET G533C variant was able to stimulate anchorage-dependent proliferation, migration and clonogenic cell survival. Notably, the effects induced by the RET G533C variant were abolished by vandetanib.; CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of pathogenic variants across RTK genes in 75% of the CC patients under analysis, suggests a previously underestimated role for RTKs in CC development. The identification of a gain-of-function RET mutation in CC highlights the potential use of RET in targeted therapy.

AB Targeted therapy against actionable gene mutations shows a significantly higher response rate as well as longer survival compared to conventional chemotherapy, and has become a standard therapy for many cancers. Recent progress in next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled to identify huge number of genetic aberrations. Based on sequencing results, patients recommend to undergo targeted therapy or immunotherapy. In cases where there are no available approved drugs for the genetic mutations detected in the patients, it is recommended to be facilitate the registration for the clinical trials. For that purpose, a NGS-based sequencing panel that can simultaneously target multiple genes in a single investigation has been used in daily clinical practice. To date, various types of sequencing panels have been developed to investigate genetic aberrations with tumor somatic genome variants (gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations, high-level copy number alterations, and gene fusions) through comprehensive bioinformatics. Because sequencing panels are efficient and cost-effective, they are quickly being adopted outside the lab, in hospitals and clinics, in order to identify personal targeted therapy for individual cancer patients.

AB Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is a common soft tissue sarcoma with approximately 1500 new cases per year. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment but recurrences are frequent and systemic options are limited. 'Tumor genotyping' is becoming more common in clinical practice as it offers the hope of personalized targeted therapy. We wanted to evaluate the results and the clinical utility of available next-generation sequencing panels in WD/DD liposarcoma. Patients who had their tumor sequenced by either FoundationOne (n = 13) or the institutional T200/T200.1 panels (n = 7) were included in this study. Significant copy number alterations were identified, but mutations were infrequent. Out of the 27 mutations detected in 7 samples, 8 (CTNNB1, MECOM, ZNF536, EGFR, EML4, CSMD3, PBRM1, PPP1R3A) were identified as deleterious (on Condel, PolyPhen and SIFT) and a truncating mutation was found in NF2. Of these, EGFR and NF2 are potential driver mutations and have not been reported previously in liposarcoma. MDM2 and CDK4 amplification was universally present in all the tested samples and multiple other recurrent genes with high amplification or high deletion were detected. Many of these targets are potentially actionable. Eight patients went on to receive an MDM2 inhibitor with a median time to progression of 23 months (95% CI: 10-83 months).

AB A common concern in smart cities is the focus on sensing procedures to provide city-wide information to city managers and citizens. To meet the growing demands of smart cities, the network must provide the ability to handle a large number of mobile sensors/devices, with high heterogeneity and unpredictable mobility, by collecting and delivering the sensed information for future treatment. This work proposes a multi-wireless technology communication platform for opportunistic data gathering and data exchange with respect to smart cities. Through the implementation of a proprietary long-range (LoRa) network and an urban sensor network, our platform addresses the heterogeneity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices while conferring communications in an opportunistic manner, increasing the interoperability of our platform. It implements and evaluates a medium access communication (MAC) protocol for LoRa networks with multiple gateways. It also implements mobile Opportunistic VEhicular (mOVE), a delay-tolerant network (DTN)-based architecture to address the mobility dimension. The platform provides vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication with support for highly reliable and actionable information flows. Moreover, taking into account the high mobility pattern that a smart city scenario presents, we propose and evaluate two forwarding strategies for the opportunistic sensor network.

AB The information fusion technique can integrate a large amount of data and knowledge representing the same real-world object and obtain a consistent, accurate, and useful representation of that object. The data may be independent or redundant, and can be obtained by different sensors at the same time or at different times. A suitable combination of investigative methods can substantially increase the profit of information in comparison with that from a single sensor. Multi-sensor information fusion has been a key issue in sensor research since the 1970s, and it has been applied in many fields. For example, manufacturing and process control industries can generate a lot of data, which have real, actionable business value. The fusion of these data can greatly improve productivity through digitization. The goal of this special issue is to report innovative ideas and solutions for multi-sensor information fusion in the emerging applications era, focusing on development, adoption, and applications.

AB Invasive candidiasis is a common healthcare-associated infection with a high mortality rate that can exceed 60% in cases of septic shock. Blood culture performance is far from ideal, due to the long time to positivity and suppression by antifungal agents. The T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR) assay is an FDA-approved qualitative molecular diagnostic method that can detect and speciate the 5 most common Candida spp.; namely, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei, in approximately 5 h. In a multicenter clinical trial that included both a prospective and a contrived arm to represent the full range of clinically relevant concentrations of Candida spp., T2MR demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 91.1% and 98.1%, respectively. The utility of T2MR in candidemia depends on the prevalence of disease in each clinical setting. In intensive care units and other high-prevalence settings, the incorporation of T2MR in diagnostic algorithms is very appealing. T2MR is expected to allow timely initiation of antifungal therapy and help with anti-fungal stewardship. In low-prevalence settings, the positive predictive value of T2MR might not be enough to justify initiation of antifungal treatment in itself. The performance of T2MR has not been studied in cases of deep-seated candidiasis. Despite some promising evidence in published clinical trials, further studies are needed to determine the performance of T2MR in invasive candidiasis without candidemia. Overall, experience with T2MR in everyday clinical practice is evolving but, in the right setting, this technology is expected to provide "actionable information" for the management of patients evaluated for candidemia.

AB Objective: To identify potentially actionable dosimetric predictors of local control (LC) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).; Methods and materials: Patients with NSCLC brain metastases treated with single-fraction SRS were identified. Eligible patients had at least 1 follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan and were without prior metastasectomy or SRS to the same lesion. LC and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify optimal cut points for dose-volume histogram metrics relative to LC.; Results: A total of 612 NSCLC brain metastasis were identified in 299 patients with single-fraction SRS between 1999 and 2014. Median follow-up was 10 months. Median OS from time of SRS was 11 months. Overall LC was 75% and 66% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. On UVA, increasing dose by any measure was associated with improved LC. On MVA, volume receiving at least 32Gy (V32; hazard ratio [HR], 0.069; P<.000), along with higher prescription isodose (HR, 0.953; P=.031) and lower volume (HR, 1.359; P<.000), were independent predictors of improved LC. ROC analysis demonstrated a V32 of 24% to be most predictive for LC. For the entire cohort, 1-year LC for V32 ≥24% was 89% versus 67% for V32 <24% (P=.000). Stratifying by volume, lesions ≤2cm (n=323) had a 1-year LC of 95% versus 82% (P=.005) for V32 above and below 24%, respectively. For lesions 2.1 to 3cm (n=211), 1-year LC was 79% versus 59% (P=.003) for V32 above and below 24%, respectively. Total tumor volume alone was predictive for OS.; Conclusions: Volume, prescription isodose line, and V32 are independent predictors of LC. V32 represents an actionable SRS treatment planning parameter for NSCLC brain metastases.

AB PURPOSE: Endometrial receptivity issues represent a potential source of implantation failure. The aim of this study was to document our experience with the endometrial receptivity array (ERA) among patients with a history of euploid blastocyst implantation failure. We investigated whether the contribution of the endometrial factor could be identified with the ERA test and if actionable results can lead to improved outcomes.; METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for 88 patients who underwent ERA testing between 2014 and 2017. Reproductive outcomes were compared for patients undergoing frozen embryo transfer (FET) using a standard progesterone protocol versus those with non-receptive results by ERA and subsequent FET according to a personalized embryo transfer (pET) protocol.; RESULTS: Of patients with at least one previously failed euploid FET, 22.5% had a displaced WOI diagnosed by ERA and qualified for pET. After pET, we found that implantation and ongoing pregnancy rates were higher (73.7 vs. 54.2% and 63.2 vs. 41.7%, respectively) compared to patients without pET, although differences were not statistically significant.; CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that a significant proportion of patients with a history of implantation failure of a euploid embryo have a displaced WOI as detected by the ERA. For these patients, pET using a modified progesterone protocol may improve the outcomes of subsequent euploid FET. Larger randomized studies are required to validate these results.

AB Iron overload (hemochromatosis) can cause serious, symptomatic disease that is preventable if detected early and managed appropriately. The leading cause of hemochromatosis in populations of predominantly European ancestry is homozygosity of the C282Y variant in the HFE gene. Screening of adults for iron overload or associated genotypes is controversial, largely because of a belief that severe phenotypes are uncommon, although cascade testing of first-degree relatives of patients is widely endorsed. We contend that severe liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer) is not at all uncommon among older males with hereditary hemochromatosis. Our review of the published data from a variety of empirical sources indicates that roughly 1 in 10 male HFE C282Y homozygotes is likely to develop severe liver disease during his lifetime unless iron overload is detected early and treated. New evidence from a randomized controlled trial of treatment allows for evidence-based management of presymptomatic patients. Although population screening for HFE C282Y homozygosity faces multiple barriers, a potentially effective strategy for increasing the early detection and prevention of clinical iron overload and severe disease is to include HFE C282Y homozygosity in lists of medically actionable gene variants when reporting the results of genome or exome sequencing.

AB Objectives: The University of Minnesota (UMN) Health Sciences Libraries conducted a needs assessment of public health researchers as part of a multi-institutional study led by Ithaka S+R. The aims of the study were to capture the evolving needs, opportunities, and challenges of public health researchers in the current environment and provide actionable recommendations. This paper reports on the data collected at the UMN site.; Methods: Participants (n=24) were recruited through convenience sampling. One-on-one interviews, held November 2016 to January 2017, were audio-recorded. Qualitative analyses were conducted using NVivo 11 Pro and were based on the principles of grounded theory.; Results: The data revealed that a broad range of skill levels among participants (e.g., literature searching) and areas of misunderstanding (e.g., current publishing landscape, open access options). Overall, data management was an afterthought. Few participants were fully aware of the breadth of librarian knowledge and skill sets, although many did express a desire for further skill development in information science.; Conclusions: Libraries can engage more public health researchers by utilizing targeted and individualized marketing regarding services. We can promote open science by educating researchers on publication realities and enhancing our data visualization skills. Libraries might take an institution-wide leadership role on matters of data management and data policy compliance.

AB Background: Simulation-based training has become an accepted clinical training andragogy in high-resource settings with its use increasing in low-resource settings. Video recordings of simulated scenarios are commonly used by facilitators. Beyond using the videos during debrief sessions, researchers can also analyze the simulation videos to quantify technical and nontechnical skills during simulated scenarios over time. Little is known about the feasibility and use of large-scale systems to video record and analyze simulation and debriefing data for monitoring and evaluation in low-resource settings.; Methods: This manuscript describes the process of designing and implementing a large-scale video monitoring system. Mentees and Mentors were consented and all simulations and debriefs conducted at 320 Primary Health Centers (PHCs) were video recorded. The system design, number of video recordings, and inter-rater reliability of the coded videos were assessed.; Results: The final dataset included a total of 11,278 videos. Overall, a total of 2,124 simulation videos were coded and 183 (12%) were blindly double-coded. For the double-coded sample, the average inter-rater reliability (IRR) scores were 80% for nontechnical skills, and 94% for clinical technical skills. Among 4,450 long debrief videos received, 216 were selected for coding and all were double-coded. Data quality of simulation videos was found to be very good in terms of recorded instances of "unable to see" and "unable to hear" in Phases 1 and 2.; Conclusion: This study demonstrates that video monitoring systems can be effectively implemented at scale in resource limited settings. Further, video monitoring systems can play several vital roles within program implementation, including monitoring and evaluation, provision of actionable feedback to program implementers, and assurance of program fidelity.

AB Since 2013, Kaiser Permanente Northern California has engaged in a systematic effort to elicit, document, and honor the care preferences of patients as they near the end of life. This is done through its Advanced Steps program, in which selected patients discuss their preferences for future medical care with their healthcare agent during a structured conversation with a trained advance care planning facilitator. The facilitator then translates the patient's wishes into an actionable medical order set using a Physician's Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form. We wanted to know whether these patients' recorded wishes were concordant with care received at the end of life. To evaluate, we conducted an in-depth chart review of 300 patients who died in 2015 and had participated in the program. We determined that 290 patients received concordant care, whereas three patients received care discordant with their wishes before death. Seven patients did not have sufficient information in their record to determine concordance. Interestingly, we found care preferences often changed over time; 20% of patients revised their end-of-life preferences after having the facilitated conversation, with most of those patients opting for less intensive care. Most changes to preferences were made verbally in the final setting of care. While advance care planning and the POLST form provide invaluable tools for recording patients' wishes, our study highlights a need to track patients' wishes as they evolve over time and a need for ongoing, real-time conversations about goals of care, even after a POLST is completed.

AB BACKGROUND: After open complex ventral hernia repair (cVHR), chronic pain has a significant impact on quality of life and processes of care.; METHODS: Records of 177 patients undergoing cVHR were reviewed in order to characterize the burden of managing postoperative pain in the first post-operative year following open cVHR.; RESULTS: In this cohort, 91 patients initiated at least one unsolicited complaint of pain, though phone call (37), unscheduled clinic visit (45) or evaluation in the emergency room (9); among these an actionable diagnosis was found in 38 (41.8%). Among 41 patients who initiated additional unsolicited complaints of pain, an actionable diagnosis was found in only 3 patients. Risk factors for such complaints included pre-operative pain and the use of synthetic mesh.; CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of an actionable diagnosis, significant resources are utilized in evaluation and management of unsolicited complaints of pain in the first year after cVHR.

AB BACKGROUND: With the efficiency and the decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing, the technology is being rapidly introduced into clinical and public health laboratory practice.; AIMS: The historical background and principles of first-, second- and third-generation sequencing are described, as are the characteristics of the most commonly used sequencing instruments.; SOURCES: Peer-reviewed literature, white papers and meeting reports.; CONTENT AND IMPLICATIONS: Next-generation sequencing is a technology that could potentially replace many traditional microbiological workflows, providing clinicians and public health specialists with more actionable information than hitherto achievable. Examples of the clinical and public health uses of the technology are provided. The challenge of comparability of different sequencing platforms is discussed. Finally, the future directions of the technology integrating it with laboratory management and public health surveillance systems, and moving it towards performing sequencing directly from the clinical specimen (metagenomics), could lead to yet another fundamental transformation of clinical diagnostics and public health surveillance.

AB BACKGROUND: Presently, the bottleneck in the deployment of high-throughput sequencing technology is the ability to analyse the increasing amount of data produced in a fit-for-purpose manner. The field of microbial bioinformatics is thriving and quickly adapting to technological changes, which creates difficulties for nonbioinformaticians in following the complexity and increasingly obscure jargon of this field.; AIMS: This review is directed towards nonbioinformaticians who wish to gain understanding of the overall microbial bioinformatic processes, from raw data obtained from sequencers to final outputs.; SOURCES: The software and analytical strategies reviewed are based on the personal experience of the authors.; CONTENT: The bioinformatic processes of transforming raw reads to actionable information in a clinical and epidemiologic context is explained. We review the advantages and limitations of two major strategies currently applied: read mapping, which is the comparison with a predefined reference genome, and de novo assembly, which is the unguided assembly of the raw data. Finally, we discuss the main analytical methodologies and the most frequently used freely available software and its application in the context of bacterial infectious disease management.; IMPLICATIONS: High-throughput sequencing technologies are overhauling outbreak investigation and epidemiologic surveillance while creating new challenges due to the amount and complexity of data generated. The continuously evolving field of microbial bioinformatics is required for stakeholders to fully harness the power of these new technologies. Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dysphagia following treatment for head and neck cancer is one of the most significant morbidities impacting quality of life. Despite the value of prophylactic exercises to mitigate the impact of radiation on long-term swallowing function, adherence to treatment is limited. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the feasibility of a mobile health application to support patient adherence to swallowing therapy during radiation-based treatment. 36 patients undergoing radiation therapy were provided with the Vibrent mobile application as an adjunct to standard swallowing therapy. The application included exercise videos, written instructions, reminders, exercise logging, and educational content. 80% of participants used the app during treatment and logged an average of 102 exercise sessions over the course of treatment. 25% of participants logged at least two exercise sessions per day over the 7-week treatment period, and 53% recorded at least one session per day. Exit interviews regarding the patient experience with the Vibrent mobile application were largely positive, but also provided actionable strategies to improve future versions of the application. The Vibrent mobile application appears to be a tool that can be feasibly integrated into existing patient care practices and may assist patients in adhering to treatment recommendations and facilitate communication between patients and providers between encounters.

AB Lung cancer is the most common type of malignancy to metastasize to the brain, with the median survival time of patients being 6-11 months. In the present study, the aim was to compare the actionable gene mutation profiles of primary lung adenocarcinoma (LC) samples and LC brain metastasis (LCBM) samples through targeted sequencing. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of 13 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded LC samples and 15 LCBM samples was performed using a customized OncoAim cancer panel and OncoAim RNA fusion panel on the MiSeq platform. The OncoAim cancer panel pipeline and OncoAim RNA fusion panel pipeline were used for bioinformatic analysis. Together, 43 variants were observed in 7 genes from the 28 cancer samples. The mutated genes of LCBM were tumor protein (TP)53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), catenin beta1, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and proto-oncogene B-Raf, which were exhibited in 10/15 (66.7%), 6/15 (40.0%), 3/15 (20.0%), 2/15 (13.3%), 2/15 (13.3%), 1/15 (6.7%) and 1/15 (6.7%) of samples, respectively. The mutated genes of LC were TP53, EGFR and KRAS, which were exhibited in 11/13 (84.6%), 5/13 (38.5%) and 2/13 (18.2%) of samples, respectively. echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements were present in 1 LCBM sample. For 2 LC samples and 1 LCBM sample, no genetic alterations were observed. The NGS data also revealed a novel 4-codon deletion of TP53 (p.V166_H169del) and a novel TP53 splice site mutation (7577157-63del TACTCAG). Further potentially actionable mutations were detected in LCBM, indicating a high degree of genetic heterogeneity between the LC and LCBM samples that were analyzed. The present study demonstrated that NGS provides an improved approach for the discovery of potentially actionable mutations and the understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and evolution.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of the CT temporal subtraction (TS) method for the detection of the lung cancer with predominant ground-glass opacity (LC-pGGO).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five pairs of CT and their TS images in patients with LC-pGGO (31 lesions) and 25 pairs of those in patients without nodules were used for an observer performance study. Eight radiologists participated and the statistical significance of differences with and without the CT-TS was assessed by JAFROC analysis.; RESULTS: The average figure-of-merit (FOM) values for all radiologists increased to a statistically significant degree, from 0.861 without CT-TS to 0.912 with CT-TS (p < .001). The average sensitivity for detecting the actionable lesions improved from 73.4 % to 85.9 % using CT-TS. The reading time with CT-TS was not significantly different from that without.; CONCLUSION: The use of CT-TS improves the observer performance for the detection of LC-pGGO.; KEY POINTS:  CT temporal subtraction can improve the detection accuracy of lung cancer.  Reading time with temporal subtraction is not different from that without.  CT temporal subtraction improves observer performance for ground-glass/subsolid nodule detection.

AB Medicaid can improve beneficiary health and help sustain its own future by embracing payment for outcomes. Good precedents exist from states such as Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Medicaid outcome measures include preventable admissions, readmissions, emergency department visits, and inpatient complications; early elective deliveries; infant and child mortality; patient-reported outcomes, satisfaction, and confidence; and reduction in low-value care. Criteria to prioritize initiatives include potential savings, availability of established models, impact on health status, and Medicaid's ability to effect change. We offer 5 principles for success, emphasizing clinically credible initiatives that generate actionable information for clinicians.

AB Cancer chronotherapy, treatment at specific times during circadian rhythms, endeavors to optimize anti-tumor effects and to lower toxicity. However, comprehensive characterization of clock genes and their clinical relevance in cancer is lacking. We systematically characterized the alterations of clock genes across 32 cancer types by analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal, and The Genomics ofDrug Sensitivity in Cancer databases. Expression alterations of clock genes are associated with key oncogenic pathways, patient survival, tumor stage, and subtype in multiple cancer types.Correlations between expression of clock genes and of other genes in the genome were altered in cancerous versus normal tissues. We identified interactions between clock genes and clinically actionable genes by analyzing co-expression, protein-protein interaction, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data and also found that clock gene expression is correlated to anti-cancer drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the circadian clock across different cancer types and highlights potential clinical utility of cancer chronotherapy. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the clinical use of two comprehensive 'mid-size' Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels calling actionable genomic aberrations in cancer. This is the first endorsement, by a regulatory body, of a new standard of care in oncology. Herein, we argue that besides its many practice-changing implications, this approval tears down the conceptual walls dividing system biology from clinical practice, diagnosis from research, prevention from therapy, cancer genetics from cancer genomics, and computational biology from empirical therapy assignment.

AB Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) carrying the D842V activating mutation in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene are a very rare subgroup of GIST (about 10%) known to be resistant to conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to show an indolent behavior. In this study, we performed an integrated molecular characterization of D842V mutant GIST by whole-transcriptome and whole-exome sequencing coupled with protein-ligand interaction modelling to identify the molecular signature and any additional recurrent genomic event related to their clinical course. We found a very specific gene expression profile of D842V mutant tumors showing the activation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and a relative downregulation of cell cycle processes. Beyond D842V, no recurrently mutated genes were found in our cohort. Nevertheless, many private, clinically relevant alterations were found in each tumor (TP53, IDH1, FBXW7, SDH-complex). Molecular modeling of PDGFRA D842V suggests that the mutant protein binds imatinib with lower affinity with respect to wild-type structure, showing higher stability during the interaction with other type I TKIs (like crenolanib). D842V mutant GIST do not show any actionable recurrent molecular events of therapeutic significance, therefore this study supports the rationale of novel TKIs development that are currently being evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of D842V mutant GIST.

AB Recent and rapid technological advances in molecular sciences have dramatically increased the ability to carry out high-throughput studies characterized by big data production. This, in turn, led to the consequent negative effect of highlighting the presence of a gap between data yield and their analysis. Indeed, big data management is becoming an increasingly important aspect of many fields of molecular research including the study of human diseases. Now, the challenge is to identify, within the huge amount of data obtained, that which is of clinical relevance. In this context, issues related to data interpretation, sharing and storage need to be assessed and standardized. Once this is achieved, the integration of data from different -omic approaches will improve the diagnosis, monitoring and therapy of diseases by allowing the identification of novel, potentially actionably biomarkers in view of personalized medicine.

AB Extensive desmoplasia is a prominent feature of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) microenvironment. Initially, studies demonstrated that desmoplasia promotes proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance in PDAC cells. While these findings suggested the therapeutic potential of targeting desmoplasia in PDAC, more recent studies utilizing genetically-engineered mouse models of PDAC, which lack key components of desmoplasia, demonstrated accelerated progression of PDAC. This contrast calls into question the paradigm that desmoplasia unilaterally promotes PDAC progression and the premise of desmoplasia-targeted therapy. This review briefly examines the major reports of the tumor-promoting and -restraining roles of desmoplasia in PDAC with commentary on the gaps in our current understanding of desmoplasia in PDAC. Additionally, we discuss the studies demonstrating the heterogeneous and multifaceted nature of desmoplasia in PDAC and advocate for future areas of research to thoroughly address the various facets of desmoplasia in PDAC, reconcile seemingly contradictory reports of the role of desmoplasia in PDAC progression, and discover aspects of desmoplasia that are therapeutically actionable.

AB The demand for health services in England is both growing and changing in nature, yet resources are limited in their ability to respond to the scale and scope of need. As a result, the NHS is under increasing pressures to realise productivity gains, while continuing to deliver high quality care. RAND Europe and the University of Manchester have been commissioned to conduct a study to examine the potential of innovation to respond to the challenges the NHS faces, and to help deliver value for money, efficient and effective services. "Innovation" in this study refers to any product, technology or service that is new to the NHS, or applied in a new way, aimed at delivering affordable and improved care. The learning we have gained adds considerable depth to the practical discussions presented regarding how innovation can be first nurtured and then made meaningful and actionable in a variety of settings. This is important given the complexity of health innovation systems and the diversity of elements that need to interact and work together for the overall system to function effectively. We share insights related to skills, capabilities and leadership; motivations and accountabilities; information and evidence; relationships and networks; patient and public engagement; and funding and commissioning. We will develop these detailed learning points into a more systematic analysis as the research evolves. The research is funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme, in close collaboration with NHS England and the Office of Life Sciences.

AB Accumulated evidence suggests that multiple molecular and cellular interactions promote cancer evolution in vivo. Surgical oncology is of growing significance to a comprehensive understanding of the malignant diseases for therapeutic application. We have analyzed more than 1000 clinical samples from surgically resected tissue to identify molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for advanced malignancies. Cancer stemness and mitotic instability were then determined as the essential predictors of aggressive phenotype with poor prognosis. Recently, whole genome/exome sequencing showed a mutational landscape underlying phenotype heterogeneity in caners. In addition, integrated genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, metabolic, proteomic and phenomic analyses elucidated several molecular subtypes that cluster in liver, pancreatic, biliary, esophageal and gastroenterological cancers. Identification of each molecular subtype is expected to realize the precise medicine targeting subtype-specific molecules; however, there are obstacle limitations to determine matching druggable targets or synthetic lethal interactions. Current breakthroughs in genome editing technology can provide us with unprecedented opportunity to recapitulate subtype-specific pathophysiology in vitro and in vivo. Given a great potential, on-demand editing system can design actionable strategy and revolutionize precision cancer medicine based on surgical oncology.

AB Objective: To explore undergraduate medical students' perception of variation in teaching and supervision at different clinical teaching sites.; Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the College of Medicine & Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, UAE during 2017. Four clinical teaching sites affiliated with CMHS were evaluated namely Shaikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC), Ambulatory Care Clinics (AC), Tawam Hospital (TH) and Al-Ain Hospital (AH). An online questionnaire was administered to year five and six students.; Results: The response rate was 84.4%. Overall perception of the students about their clinical clerkship experience was positive. SKMC was rated as the best teaching site with mean rating of 3.79±0.97-4.79±0.43. The highest rated item was clinical teacher's promotion of critical thinking in students while the lowest rated item was the opportunity to take responsibility for patient care. Ambulatory Care site had a mean rating of 2.33±1.23-4.13±1.19. The highest rated item at this site was the clinical teacher encouraging students to ask questions and participate actively. At Tawam Hospital, the mean ratings ranged between 2.65±1.64-4.31±0.86 with highest rated item being ability of the students to see cases with positive clinical findings. At the Al-Ain Hospital, the mean rating was in the range of 2.79±1.45-3.81±1.11. The item rated highest here was the ability of students to see cases with positive clinical findings. The lowest rated item at all three sites was the availability of on-call rooms and lockers. Significant variability was seen across training sites in the clinical teacher's ability to act as professional role models, the opportunity for students to apply their previous knowledge to patient care and to independently assess patients before discussion with teachers.; Conclusion: This study tool highlights variation in clinical teaching and supervision at four clinical teaching sites. It provides specific, actionable information which can be utilized to deliver equitable learning experiences across clinical clerkships and teaching sites. It places emphasis on the fact that lack of physical facilities hampers clinical teaching and supervision, hence, on call rooms, lockers and separate rooms for independent student interaction with patients should be provided at all clinical teaching sites.

AB Clinicians do not have the time or resources to consider the underlying evidence for the myriad decisions they must make each day and, as a consequence, rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines. Guideline panels should consider all the relevant factors (criteria) that influence a decision or recommendation in a structured, explicit, and transparent way and provide clinicians with clear and actionable recommendations. In this article, we will describe the Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks for clinical practice recommendations. The general structure of the EtD framework for clinical recommendations is similar to EtD frameworks for other types of recommendations and decisions, and includes formulation of the question, an assessment of the different criteria, and conclusions. Clinical recommendations require considering criteria differently, depending on whether an individual patient or a population perspective is taken. For example, from an individual patient's perspective, out-of-pocket costs are an important consideration, whereas, from a population perspective, resource use (not only out-of-pocket costs) and cost effectiveness are important. From a population perspective, equity, acceptability, and feasibility are also important considerations, whereas the importance of these criteria is often limited from an individual patient perspective. Specific subgroups for which different recommendations may be required should be clearly identified and considered in relation to each criterion because judgments might vary across subgroups. This article is a translation of the original article published in the British Medical Journal. The EtD frameworks are currently used in the Clinical Practice Guideline Programme of the Spanish National Health System, co-ordinated by GuiaSalud. Copyright © 2017 SESPAS.

AB Farmers, food supply-chain entities, and policymakers need a simple but robust indicator to demonstrate progress toward reducing nitrogen pollution associated with food production. We show that nitrogen balance-the difference between nitrogen inputs and nitrogen outputs in an agricultural production system-is a robust measure of nitrogen losses that is simple to calculate, easily understood, and based on readily available farm data. Nitrogen balance provides farmers with a means of demonstrating to an increasingly concerned public that they are succeeding in reducing nitrogen losses while also improving the overall sustainability of their farming operation. Likewise, supply-chain companies and policymakers can use nitrogen balance to track progress toward sustainability goals. We describe the value of nitrogen balance in translating environmental targets into actionable goals for farmers and illustrate the potential roles of science, policy, and agricultural support networks in helping farmers achieve them.

AB In the context of oncology, liquid biopsies consist of harvesting cancer biomarkers, such as circulating tumor cells, tumor-derived cell-free DNA, and extracellular vesicles, from bodily fluids. These biomarkers provide a source of clinically actionable molecular information that can enable precision medicine. Herein, we review technologies for the molecular profiling of liquid biopsy markers with special emphasis on the analysis of low abundant markers from mixed populations.

AB During the course of biomedical research, researchers sometimes obtain information on participants that is outside the aim of the study but may nonetheless be relevant to the participants. These incidental findings, as they are known, have been the focus of a substantial amount of discussion in the bioethics literature, and a consensus has begun to emerge about what researchers should do in light of the possibility of incidental findings. A consensus, however, is not necessarily correct. In this article, we address the common view that reporting of incidental findings should be based primarily on the possibility of medical benefit, factoring in the findings' validity, clinical actionability, and significance to health or reproduction. While such medical beneficence should not be discarded, the need to give proper attention to participants' autonomy, privacy, and interests (especially considering discussion of participants' right not to know) suggests an alternative standard for when to report incidental findings: even if they are of no direct medical benefit, incidental findings should be reported based on the extent to which the participant can be expected to comprehend the information. We will offer a preliminary defense of this alternative as best respecting participants' autonomy and privacy and promoting their interests. However, we acknowledge that the standard would face significant practical barriers, and these barriers lead us to propose a metaconsent addendum that would allow subjects to essentially waive the comprehension standard when resource or other constraints make meeting it impracticable. © 2018 The Hastings Center.

AB BACKGROUND: Many recurrences occur after electrical cardioversion (ECV) of atrial fibrillation (AF). Assessment of extent of remodeling and continuous prolonged rhythm monitoring might reveal actionable recurrence mechanisms.; HYPOTHESIS: After ECV of AF specific patterns of arrhythmia recurrence can be distinguished.; METHODS: All patients who underwent successful ECV due to persistent AF were included. Tissue velocity echocardiography during AF was performed before ECV to study atrial fibrillatory cycle length and fibrillatory velocity. After ECV, the heart rhythm of all patients was monitored 3 times daily during 4weeks, and timing of recurrence was noted.; RESULTS: In total, 50 patients (68% male) were included; mean age was 68±9years. Median duration of the current AF episode was 102 (range, 74-152) days. Twenty-one (42%) patients showed recurrence of persistent AF. No recurrences occurred during the first 24hours. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between patients with or without recurrence of AF. However, patients with early recurrence of AF had significantly higher precardioversion wall-motion velocity compared with patients who remained in sinus rhythm (2.8 [1.6-3.6] vs 1.4 [0.9-3.3] cm/s; P=0.017), whereas atrial fibrillatory cycle length did not differ.; CONCLUSIONS: In this study on 50 patients successfully cardioverted for persistent AF, there was a relapse gap of ≥24hours. This phenomenon has not been well appreciated before and offers an AF-free window of opportunity for electrocardiographically triggered cardiac imaging or complex electrophysiological procedures. Echocardiographic tissue velocity imaging may visualize atrial remodeling relevant to AF recurrence. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Nutrition is the fundamental bridge between food and health. Inadequate fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption has been linked to an increase in global noncommunicable diseases, which places a greater burden on health systems (1) . Despite much emphasis from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on the benefits of increased FV consumption, neither results nor an understanding of the complexity of food security and the actions of a diverse array of stakeholders needed to achieve outcomes have been attained. To address this challenge, the Alliance for Food & Health (AFH) uses a multistakeholder approach to engage cross-sector solutions. This paper, the first in a series, addresses the global challenge of FV consumption by examining and synthesizing current practices and outcomes and providing actionable recommendations for government, private-sector, and civil-society stakeholders. To effectively reduce the global noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden, it is critical that stakeholders work in concordance with the WHO/FAO Second International Conference on Nutrition commitments ( Table1 ), United Nations (UN) Decade of Action on Nutrition Action Areas ( Table2 ), and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) applicable to this issue ( Table3 ). AFH's top line recommendations ( Table4 ) align with multiple UN SDGs (2) . All recommendations connect with the following three SDGs: #2: "Zero Hunger," #3: "Good Health and Well-Being," and #17: "Partnerships for the Goals." This indicates AFH's integration of the food, agriculture, and global health communities in efforts to combat NCDs. A variety of recommendations align with #9: "Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure," #11: "Sustainable Cities and Communities," and #12: "Responsible Consumption and Production."

AB Microbial communities contribute to a wide variety of biological functions in hosts and have the ability to specifically influence the health of those organisms through production of specialized metabolites. However, the structures or molecular mechanisms related to health or disease in host-microbe interactions represent a knowledge gap. In order to close this gap, we propose that a combinatory approach, pulling from microbiology and analytical chemistry, be considered to investigate these interactions so as to gain a better understanding of the chemistry being produced. We hypothesize that bacteria alter their chemistry in order to survive and induce specific states in their host organisms. Our lab makes use of imaging mass spectrometry and other analytical techniques to study this chemistry in situ, which provides actionable information to test hypotheses.

AB The National Collaborating Centres for Public Health (NCCPH) collaborated on the development of an action framework for integrating equity into population health status reporting. This framework integrates the research literature with on-the-ground experience collected using a unique collaborative learning approach with public health practitioners from across Canada. This article introduces the Action Framework, describes the learning process, and then situates population health status reporting (PHSR) in the current work of the public health sector. This is followed by a discussion of the nature of evidence related to the social determinants of health as a key aspect of deciding what and how to report. Finally, the connection is made between data and implementation by exploring the concept of actionable information and detailing the Action Framework for equity-integrated population health status reporting. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of putting knowledge mobilization at the core of the PHSR process and makes suggestions for next steps. The purpose of the article is to encourage practitioners to use, discuss, and ultimately strengthen the framework.

AB This issue includes several excellent observational studies prompted by physicians' clinical questions. Many people use lots of menthol cough drops-does the menthol overall lengthen the cough duration? When should we intensify treatment of older individuals with diabetes? Do occipital nerve blocks work for acute migraine headaches? Did you know that the plantar fascia can rupture? What happens to those patients with chest pain but low pretest probability for serious cardiac disease who are admitted to the hospital? Acupuncture can work well-for the patients-but how can we incorporate it into the usual pace of the family medicine office? Is it a win-lose situation when medical assistant roles are expanded? How many practice sites do physicians have and does that make a difference in the number or type of health personnel shortage areas? What would you guess on the presence of humor in the medical office-more or less than half of the visits; introduced by doctors or patients; primary care or specialty doctors? © Copyright 2018 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB PURPOSE: Different patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are used for rheumatic diseases (RD). The aims of this study are-(1) Identify PROMIS domains most relevant to care of patients with RD, (2) Collect T-Score metrics in patients with RD, and (3) Identify clinically meaningful cut-points for these domains.; METHODS: A convenience sample of RD patients was recruited consecutively during clinic visits, and asked to complete computer-adaptive tests on thirteen Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments. Based on discussion with clinical providers, four measures were chosen to be relevant and actionable (from rheumatologists' perspective) in RD patients. Data from RD patients were used to develop clinical vignettes across a range of symptom severity. Vignettes were created based on most likely item responses at different levels on the T-score metric (mean=50; SD=10) and anchored at 5-point intervals (0.5 SDs). Patients with RD (N=9) and clinical providers (N=10) participated as expert panelists in separate one-day meetings using a modified educational standard setting method.; RESULTS: Four domains (physical function, pain interferences, sleep disturbance, depression) that are actionable at the point-of-care were selected. For all domains, patients endorsed cut-points at lower levels of impairment than providers by 0.5 to 1 SD (e.g., severe impairment in physical function was defined as a T-score of 35 by patients and 25 by providers).; CONCLUSIONS: We used a modified educational method to estimate clinically relevant cut-points to classify severity for PROMIS measures This allows for meaningful interpretation of PROMIS measures in a clinical setting of RD population.

AB CONTEXT: - Different testing algorithms and platforms for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements in advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma exist. The multistep approach with single-gene assays has been challenged by more efficient next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a large number of gene alterations. The main criticism of the NGS approach is the detection of genomic alterations of uncertain significance.; OBJECTIVE: - To determine the best testing algorithm for patients with lung cancer in our clinical practice.; DESIGN: - Two testing approaches for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma were offered between 2012-2015. One approach was reflex testing for an 8-gene panel composed of DNA Sanger sequencing for EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF and fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK, ROS1, MET, and RET. At the oncologist's request, a subset of tumors tested by the 8-gene panel was subjected to a 50-gene Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel.; RESULTS: - Of 1200 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), 57 including 46 adenocarcinomas and NSCLCs, not otherwise specified; 7 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs); and 4 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs) were subjected to Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel detected 9 potentially actionable variants in 29 adenocarcinomas that were wild type by the 8-gene panel testing (9 of 29, 31.0%) in the following genes: ERBB2 (3 of 29, 10.3%), STK11 (2 of 29, 6.8%), PTEN (2 of 29, 6.8%), FBXW7 (1 of 29, 3.4%), and BRAF G469A (1 of 29, 3.4%). Four SCCs and 2 LCNECs showed investigational genomic alterations.; CONCLUSIONS: - The NGS approach would result in the identification of a significant number of actionable gene alterations, increasing the therapeutic options for patients with advanced NSCLCs.

AB In oncology, actionable mutations (alterations) in cancer-associated genes are critical in terms of the selection of therapeutic approaches. Next-generation sequencing of tumor sample DNA (ie, clinical sequencing) can guide clinical management by providing diagnostic or prognostic data, and facilitating the identification of potential treatment regimens, such as molecular-targeted and immune checkpoint blockade therapies. In the USA, a variety of tumor-profiling multiplex gene panels have been developed and implemented for this purpose. In Japan, several academic institutions have now carried out detailed investigations of the feasibility and value of clinical sequencing, and cancer societies have issued consensus clinical practice guidance for next-generation sequencing-based gene panel tests. These efforts will facilitate the implementation of cancer genome medicine in Japan. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Population health management (PHM) approaches to improve cost and quality remain limited. To address this gap, stakeholders within an integrated delivery and financing system in Western Pennsylvania designed, implemented, and tested a value-based care model for children with medically complex conditions that could be scaled across the broader pediatric population. The model included: (1) a multilevel, interdisciplinary infrastructure; (2) actionable analytics reports to guide continuous quality improvement; (3) alternative provider payments; (4) consumer-directed spending accounts; and (5) shared savings with practices. Four practices caring for 215 children (<age 21) with medically complex conditions participated in the demonstration. Quality and cost outcomes were compared between the intervention group and a comparison group using propensity scores. The program generated cost savings over a 2-year performance period, although the difference between the intervention and comparison groups was not significant, likely because of the small N. Quality of care was maintained or improved for the intervention group from baseline to the end of the performance period. This model is an example of how real-world laboratories that leverage strong payer-provider partnerships can be a useful platform for testing value-based PHM models with the potential to reduce healthcare costs while maintaining or improving care quality.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate radiologists' performance in detecting actionable nodules on chest CT when aided by a pulmonary vessel image-suppressed function and a computer-aided detection (CADe) system.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel computerized pulmonary vessel image-suppressed function with a built-in CADe (VIS/CADe) system was developed to assist radiologists in interpreting thoracic CT images. Twelve radiologists participated in a comparative study without and with the VIS/CADe using 324 cases (involving 95 cancers and 83 benign nodules). The ratio of nodule-free cases to cases with nodules was 2:1 in the study. Localization ROC (LROC) methods were used for analysis.; RESULTS: In a stand-alone test, the VIS/CADe system detected 89.5% and 82.0% of malignant nodules and all nodules no smaller than 5 mm, respectively. The false-positive rate per CT study was 0.58. For the reader study, the mean area under the LROC curve (LROCAUC) for the detection of lung cancer significantly increased from 0.633 when unaided by VIS/CADe to 0.773 when aided by VIS/CADe (p < 0.01). For the detection of all clinically actionable nodules, the mean LROC-AUC significantly increased from 0.584 when unaided by VIS/CADe to 0.692 when detection was aided by VIS/CADe (p < 0.01). Radiologists detected 80.0% of cancers with VIS/CADe versus 64.45% of cancers unaided (p < 0.01); specificity decreased from 89.9% to 84.4% (p < 0.01). Radiologist interpretation time significantly decreased by 26%.; CONCLUSION: The VIS/CADe system significantly increased radiologists' detection of cancers and actionable nodules with somewhat lower specificity. With use of the VIS/CADe system, radiologists increased their interpretation speed by a factor of approximately one-fourth. Our study suggests that the technique has the potential to assist radiologists in the detection of additional actionable nodules on thoracic CT.

AB Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) is a population-based and facility-based survey program conducted in 11 countries to track contraceptive use dynamics and the supply environment. Annual data collection provides trend data unavailable from any other source. Two-stage cluster sampling was used to select 58 enumeration areas in Kinshasa; data were collected in 2014, 2015 and 2016 from three to six service delivery points (SDPs) per EA. Of the 228-248 SDPs surveyed each year, only two-thirds reported to offer family planning (FP) services. Of those reporting to offer FP, one-fifth or more did not do so on the day of the survey. As of 2016, only one-half of SDPs offering FP had at least three methods available, a proxy for contraceptive choice; only one in five had at least five methods. Long-acting reversible contraceptives, including implants and IUDs, were less widely offered and more often stocked out than resupply methods, including condoms, pills and injectables. Contraceptive stockouts were rampant: in 2016, over a quarter of the SDPs experienced stockouts of all methods (except condoms) in the previous 3months, and two of the three most widely used methods-implants and injectables-were also the most likely to be stocked out. The findings documented the inconsistency in pricing of methods across facilities; moreover, less than one quarter of SDPs posted prices. Patterns in the contraceptive supply environment remained relatively unchanged between 2014 and 2016. The PMA2020 SDP module provides timely, actionable information to the DRC government, FP implementing organizations and donors involved in FP service delivery in Kinshasa, DRC. Yet the value of this information will be determined by the ability of the local FP stakeholders to use it in bringing the needed improvements identified by this survey to the contraceptive supply environment. © The Authors 2017.

AB Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which provide a direct measure of a patient's health status or treatment preferences, represent a key component of the shift toward patient-centered health care. PROs can measure the state of a patient's disease-specific and overall health throughout the care continuum, enabling them to have a variety of uses for key health care stakeholders. Currently, PROs are used in drug development, aligning patient and clinician goals in care, quality-of-care measures, and coverage and reimbursement decisions. While there have been significant strides by key health care stakeholders to further the development and use of PROs, there are a number of challenges limiting more widespread use. In light of these current challenges and the potential for PROs to improve health care quality and value, on October 19, 2017, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy convened a forum of key stakeholders representing patients, payers, providers, government, and pharmaceutical companies to discuss and identify solutions to the current challenges and barriers to further use of PROs. These discussions informed the development of participants' ideal future state in which PROs maximize the goals of all health care stakeholders and the actionable steps required to make the future state a reality. While stakeholders shared unique perspectives throughout the forum, they had consensus on 2 overarching issues: the importance of PROs in defining value, improving patient care, and implementing value-based payment models and the need for strong organizational and operational systems to achieve optimal adoption and use. Participants identified several key challenges in PRO use and adoption: achieving a representative patient population, inclusion of PRO data in medication labels, the necessity for both standardized and customizable PROs, and operational and organizational barriers to collecting and analyzing PROs. To overcome these challenges, participants recommended that manufacturers should engage key stakeholders early and throughout the drug development process to ensure the most valid and representative PROs and patient populations will be included. To streamline the PRO collection process, participants suggested engaging pharmacists and other providers who may have more frequent interaction with patients. Participants also recommended that PRO collection and analysis should use common technology platforms, streamline components of clinician care to reduce workflow, and be integrated with claims data to provider payers a better understanding of patient health in real time. Finally, additional work should be done to develop patient-reported outcome measures that contain relevant measures for all healthcare stakeholders. While significant challenges remain in PRO development and adoption, participants agreed that greater use can only be achieved through collaboration and patient-centered care.; DISCLOSURES: The AMCP Partnership Forum titled "Improving Quality, Value, and Outcomes with Patient-Reported Outcomes" and the development of this proceedings report were supported by Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, Precision for Value, Premier, Sanofi, Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA, and Xcenda.

AB Food, energy, and water (FEW) systems are inexorably linked. Earth's changing climate and increasing competition for finite land resources are creating and amplifying challenges at the FEW nexus. Managing FEW systems to mitigate these negative impacts and stresses is a pressing policy issue. The FEW interface is often managed as three independent systems, missing disruptive opportunities for streamlined integrated management. We contend that existing technologies can be reframed and emerging technologies can be harnessed for integrated FEW management, changing the way that each resource system operates within the broader system. We discuss solutions to three main challenges to integrating FEW system management: resolving spatiotemporal disconnections over multiple scales; closing resource loops; and creating actionable information. Sustainable resource management is critical for humanity, as well as for functioning trade systems and ecological health. Embracing integrated management in FEW systems would enable policy makers and managers to more efficiently and effectively secure critical resource systems in the face of global change.

AB Distinguishing the vegetation dynamics induced by anthropogenic factors and identifying the major drivers can provide crucial information for designing actionable and practical countermeasures to restore degraded grassland ecosystems. Based on the residual trend (RESTREND) method, this study distinguished the vegetation dynamics induced by anthropogenic factors from the effects of climate variability on the Mongolian Plateau during 1993-2012 using vegetation optical depth (VOD) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which measure vegetation water content in aboveground biomass and chlorophyll abundance in canopy cover respectively; afterwards, the major drivers within different agricultural zones and socio-institutional periods were identified by integrating agricultural statistics with statistical analysis techniques. The results showed that grasslands in Mongolia and the grazing zone of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR), China underwent a significant human-induced decrease in aboveground biomass during 1993-2012 and 1993-2000 respectively, which was attributable to the rapid growth of livestock densities stimulated by livestock privatization and market factors; by contrast, grasslands in these two regions did not experience a concurrent human-induced reduction in canopy greenness. Besides, the results indicated that grasslands in the grazing zone of IMAR underwent a significant human-induced increase in aboveground biomass since 2000, which was attributable to the reduced grazing pressure induced by China's ecological restoration programs; concurrently, grasslands in this region also experienced a remarkable increase in canopy greenness, however, this increase was found not directly caused by the decreased stocking densities. Furthermore, the results revealed that the farming and semi-grazing/farming zone of IMAR underwent a significant human-induced increase in both aboveground biomass and canopy greenness since 2000, which was attributable to the intensified grain production stimulated by market factors, open grazing regulation and confined feeding popularization. These findings suggest that China's grassland restoration practice has important implications for Mongolia to reverse the severe and continuous grassland degradation in the future.

AB The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) in the U.S. has been rising, from an estimated annual incidence of 49,560 in 2013 to 61,380 in 2017. Meanwhile, the SEER-based relative survival of women with EC in the U.S. has remained flat [82.3% from 1987 to 1989, 82.8% from 2007 to 2013] and our recent increased understanding of EC biology and subtypes has not been translated into therapeutic advances. The U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) therefore convened a Uterine Clinical Trials Planning Meeting in January 2016 to initiate and accelerate design of molecularly-targeted EC trials. Prior to the meeting a group of experts in this field summarized available data, emphasizing data on human samples, to identify potentially actionable alterations in EC, and the results of their work has been separately published. The Clinical Trials Meeting planners focused on discussion of (1) novel trial designs, including window-of opportunity trials and appropriate control groups for randomized trials, (2) targets specific to serous carcinoma and promises and pitfalls of separate trials for women with tumors of this histology (3) specific recommendations for future randomized trials.

AB BACKGROUND: Our health care system fails to deliver necessary results, and incremental system improvements will not deliver needed change. Learning health systems (LHSs) are seen as a means to accelerate outcomes, improve care delivery, and further clinical research; yet, few such systems exist. We describe the process of codesigning, with all relevant stakeholders, an approach for creating a collaborative chronic care network (C3N), a peer-produced networked LHS.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report the methods used, with a diverse group of stakeholders, to translate the idea of a C3N to a set of actionable next steps.; METHODS: The setting was ImproveCareNow, an improvement network for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. In collaboration with patients and families, clinicians, researchers, social scientists, technologists, and designers, C3N leaders used a modified idealized design process to develop a design for a C3N.; RESULTS: Over 100 people participated in the design process that resulted in (1) an overall concept design for the ImproveCareNow C3N, (2) a logic model for bringing about this system, and (3) 13 potential innovations likely to increase awareness and agency, make it easier to collect and share information, and to enhance collaboration that could be tested collectively to bring about the C3N.; CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate methods that resulted in a design that has the potential to transform the chronic care system into an LHS. ©Michael Seid, George Dellal, Laura E Peterson, Lloyd Provost, Peter A Gloor, David Livingstone Fore, Peter A Margolis.

AB Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC) is a unique clinical and histologic category of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most of patients with SqCLC tend to be older, typically at advanced stage, associated with smoking and have more complications. With progress of targeted therapy of lung cancer, we identified several potential actionable genetic abnormalities such as FGFR. Several FGFR inhibitors have been approved for clinical use in different cancers. And some of these agents are currently under investigation in clinical trials for SqCLC. This article summarizes the current knowledge about FGFR aberrations, the relative inhibitors in development and clinical data in SqCLC.

AB The energy sector is closely interconnected with the building sector and integrated Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions for effective energy management supporting decision-making at building, district and city level are key fundamental elements for making a city Smart. The available systems are designed and intended exclusively for a predefined number of cases and systems without allowing for expansion and interoperability with other applications that is partially due to the lack of semantics. This paper presents an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) based system for intelligent energy management in buildings. A semantic framework is introduced aiming at the unified and standardised modelling of the entities that constitute the building environment. Suitable rules are formed, aiming at the intelligent energy management and the general modus operandi of Smart Building. In this context, an IoT-based system was implemented, which enhances the interactivity of the buildings' energy management systems. The results from its pilot application are presented and discussed. The proposed system extends existing approaches and integrates cross-domain data, such as the building's data (e.g., energy management systems), energy production, energy prices, weather data and end-users' behaviour, in order to produce daily and weekly action plans for the energy end-users with actionable personalised information.

AB OBJECTIVE: Major gaps remain in our understanding of primary care patient safety. We describe a toolkit for measuring patient safety in family practices.; METHODS: Six tools were used in 46 practices. These tools were as follows: National Health Service Education for Scotland Trigger Tool, National Health Service Education for Scotland Medicines Reconciliation Tool, Primary Care Safequest, Prescribing Safety Indicators, Patient Reported Experiences and Outcomes of Safety in Primary Care, and Concise Safe Systems Checklist.; RESULTS: Primary Care Safequest showed that most practices had a well-developed safety climate. However, the trigger tool revealed that a quarter of events identified were associated with moderate or substantial harm, with a third originating in primary care and avoidable. Although medicines reconciliation was undertaken within 2 days in more than 70% of cases, necessary discussions with a patient/carer did not always occur. The prescribing safety indicators identified 1435 instances of potentially hazardous prescribing or lack of recommended monitoring (from 92,649 patients). The Concise Safe Systems Checklist found that 25% of staff thought that their practice provided inadequate follow-up for vulnerable patients discharged from hospital and inadequate monitoring of noncollection of prescriptions. Most patients had a positive perception of the safety of their practice although 45% identified at least one safety problem in the past year.; CONCLUSIONS: Patient safety is complex and multidimensional. The Patient Safety Toolkit is easy to use and hosted on a single platform with a collection of tools generating practical and actionable information. It enables family practices to identify safety deficits that they can review and change procedures to improve their patient safety across a key sets of patient safety issues.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite being disproportionately burdened by preventable diseases than more advanced countries, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) continue to trail behind other parts of the world in the number, quality and impact of scholarly activities by their health researchers. Our strategy at the Nigerian Implementation Science Alliance (NISA) is to utilise innovative platforms that catalyse collaboration, enhance communication between different stakeholders, and promote the uptake of evidence-based interventions in improving healthcare delivery. This article reports on findings from a structured group exercise conducted at the 2016 NISA Conference to identify (1) gaps in developing research capacity and (2) potential strategies to address these gaps.; METHODS: A 1-hour structured group exercise was conducted with 15 groups of 2-9 individuals (n = 94) to brainstorm gaps for implementation, strategies to address gaps and to rank their top 3 in each category. Qualitative thematic analysis was used. First, duplicate responses were merged and analyses identified emerging themes. Each of the gaps and strategies identified were categorised as falling into the purview of policy-makers, researchers, implementing partners or multiple groups.; RESULTS: Participating stakeholders identified 98 gaps and 91 strategies related to increasing research capacity in Nigeria. A total of 45 gaps and an equal number of strategies were ranked; 39 gaps and 43 strategies were then analysed, from which 8 recurring themes emerged for gaps (lack of sufficient funding, poor research focus in education, inadequate mentorship and training, inadequate research infrastructure, lack of collaboration between researchers, research-policy dissonance, lack of motivation for research, lack of leadership buy-in for research) and 7 themes emerged for strategies (increased funding for research, improved research education, improved mentorship and training, improved infrastructure for research, increased collaboration between academic/research institutions, greater engagement between researchers and policy-makers, greater leadership buy-in for research).; CONCLUSIONS: The gaps and strategies identified in this study represent pathways judged to be important in increasing research and implementation science capacity in Nigeria. The inclusion of perspectives and involvement of stakeholders who play different roles in policy, research and implementation activities makes these findings comprehensive, relevant and actionable, not only in Nigeria but in other similar LMICs.

AB BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the cessation of electric or mechanical activity of the heart, confirmed by absence of circulation. Survival to hospital dismissal rates have remained low nationwide despite considerable effort to improve treatment. Current initiatives seek systems approaches that optimize care at each point along the "chain of survival." Systems approaches rely on the availability of robust data sets to understand and control variables that can be highly interdependent. The current report seeks to provide a source of reliable data of OHCA for South Dakota.; METHODS: Using the "Utstein" guidelines for reviewing and reporting OHCA resuscitations issued by the American Heart Association in 2014, we analyzed the EMS data that were captured by ePCR between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were 911 calls in 2013-2015, where first impression of the call was cardiac arrest. Exclusion criteria were inconsistent and missing data.; RESULTS: There were 1,781 OHCA in the ePCR, and 1,280 cases had survival information, with 378 victims surviving to ED. Overall, SD OHCA rates were lower than those reported nationally. Survival was the highest in patients with a shockable rhythm and when victim received bystander CPR. The odds for survival were greater if the arrest took place in an urban setting compared to a rural setting and if the victim received care from an EMS unit that did not have a "hardship" designation.; DISCUSSION: Recommendations for future efforts include: (1) Develop and employ quality improvement methodologies for data collection and utilization to minimize the impact of poor or missing data, (2) Assess the educational and training needs of the EMS staff to properly collect, analyze, and develop actionable outputs, (3) Provide public training to include hands-only CPR and PulsePoint.

AB PURPOSE: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has identified recurrent genomic alterations in metastatic breast cancer (MBC); however, the clinical utility of incorporating routine sequencing to guide treatment decisions in this setting is unclear. We examine the frequency of genomic alterations in MBC patients from academic and community hospitals and correlate with clinical outcomes.; METHODS: MBC patients with good performance status were prospectively recruited at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) in Canada. Molecular profiling on DNA extracted from FFPE archival tissues was performed on the Sequenom MassArray platform or the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (TSACP) on the MiSeq platform. Clinical trial outcomes by RECIST 1.1 and time on treatment were reviewed retrospectively.; RESULTS: From January 2012 to November 2015, 483 MBC patients were enrolled and 440 were genotyped. At least one somatic mutation was identified in 46% of patients, most commonly in PIK3CA (28%) or TP53 (13%). Of 203 patients with≥1 mutation(s), 15% were treated on genotype-matched and 9% on non-matched trials. There was no significant difference for median time on treatment for patients treated on matched vs. non-matched therapies (3.6 vs. 3.8months; p=0.89).; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world outcomes on hotspot genotyping and small targeted panel sequencing of MBC patients from academic and community settings. Few patients were matched to clinical trials with targeted therapies. More comprehensive profiling and improved access to clinical trials may increase therapeutic options for patients with actionable mutations. Further studies are needed to evaluate if this approach leads to improved clinical outcomes.

AB Despite it being abhorrent and illegal, torture is sometimes employed for information gathering. However, the extreme stressors employed during torture force the brain away from the relatively narrow, adaptive range of function it operates within. Torture degrades signal-to-noise ratios of information yield and increases false positive discovery rates. As a discovery methodology, torture fails basic tests of veridical, reliable and replicable information discovery. Torture fails during interrogation because it is an assault on our core integrated, social, psychological and neural functioning. There is a need for a profound cultural shift regarding torture, recognizing that torture impairs, rather than facilitates, investigations and truth-finding. Rising to this challenge will increase operational effectiveness, eliminate prisoner abuse and torment, and aid veridical and actionable information gathering. Policy regarding prisoner and detainee interrogation need to be refocused as a behavioural and brain sciences problem, and not simply treated as a legal, ethical or philosophical problem. Getting the science, ethics and practice in line is a challenge, but it can and should be done.

AB Importance: Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare, aggressive tumor arising from the peritoneal lining, induced by asbestos, therapeutic radiation, or germline mutations. Nevertheless, the molecular features remain largely unknown.; Objective: To investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in a large series of peritoneal mesothelioma and characterize the mutational landscape of these tumors.; Design, Setting, and Participants: We studied 88 consecutive patients (39 men, 49 women; median age 61, range 17-84 years) with peritoneal mesotheliomas diagnosed at a single institution between 2005 and 2015. We identified ALK-positive mesotheliomas by immunohistochemistry and confirmed ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In ALK-rearranged cases, we characterized the fusion partners using targeted next-generation sequencing of both tumor DNA and RNA. In select cases, we quantified asbestos fibers by combined scanning electron microscopy and x-ray spectroscopy. We also explored ALK rearrangement in a separate series of 205 patients with pleural mesothelioma.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Identification and characterization of novel ALK rearrangements and correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics.; Results: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase was positive by immunohistochemistry in 11 (13%) peritoneal mesotheliomas (focal weak in 8, diffuse strong in 3). In focal weak ALK-positive cases, no ALK rearrangement was detected by FISH or next-generation sequencing. In strong diffuse ALK-positive cases, FISH confirmed ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing identified novel fusion partners ATG16L1, STRN, and TPM1. Patients with ALK-rearranged peritoneal mesotheliomas were women and younger than patients without ALK rearrangement (median age 36 vs 62; Mann-Whitney test, P=.02), but all other clinicopathologic characteristics (size of tumor nodules, histology, treatment, and survival) were not different. No asbestos fibers were detected in ALK-rearranged cases. Furthermore, loss of chromosomal region 9p or 22q or genetic alterations in BAP1, SETD2, or NF2 typically present in peritoneal mesothelioma were absent in the ALK-rearranged cases. All pleural mesotheliomas were ALK-negative by immunohistochemistry.; Conclusions and Relevance: We identified unique ALK rearrangements in a subset of patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, each lacking asbestos fibers, therapeutic radiation, and cytogenetic and molecular alterations typically found in these tumors. Identification of clinically actionable ALK rearrangements may represent a novel pathogenetic mechanism of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma with promise for targeted therapy.

AB CONTEXT: - Thyroid nodules have a prevalence of approximately 70% in adults. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a minimally invasive, cost-effective, standard method to collect tissue from thyroid nodules for cytologic examination. However, approximately 15% of thyroid FNA specimens cannot be unambiguously diagnosed as benign or malignant.; OBJECTIVE: - To investigate whether clinically actionable data can be obtained using next-generation sequencing of residual needle rinse material.; DESIGN: - A total of 24 residual needle rinse specimens with malignant (n = 6), indeterminate (n = 9), or benign (n = 9) thyroid FNA diagnoses were analyzed in our clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory using next-generation sequencing assays designed to detect gene mutations and translocations that commonly occur in thyroid cancer. Results were correlated with surgical diagnoses and clinical outcomes.; RESULTS: - Interpretable data were generated from 23 of 24 residual needle rinse specimens. Consistent with its well-known role in thyroid malignancy, BRAF V600E mutations were detected in 4 malignant cases. An NRAS mutation was detected in 1 benign case. No mutations were detected from specimens with indeterminate diagnoses.; CONCLUSIONS: - Our data demonstrate that residual thyroid FNA needle rinses are an adequate source of material for molecular diagnostic testing. Importantly, detection of a mutation implicated in thyroid malignancy was predictive of the final surgical diagnosis and clinical outcome. Our strategy to triage thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology with molecular testing eliminates the need to perform additional FNA passes into dedicated media or to schedule additional invasive procedures. Further investigation with a larger sample size to confirm the clinical utility of our proposed strategy is underway.

AB Clarifying allele frequencies of disease-related genetic variants in a population is important in genomic medicine; however, such data is not yet available for the Japanese population. To estimate frequencies of actionable pathogenic variants in the Japanese population, we examined the reported pathological variants in genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) in our reference panel of genomic variations, 2KJPN, which was created by whole-genome sequencing of 2049 individuals of the resident cohort of the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project. We searched for pathogenic variants in 2KJPN for 57 autosomal ACMG-recommended genes responsible for 26 diseases and then examined their frequencies. By referring to public databases of pathogenic variations, we identified 143 reported pathogenic variants in 2KJPN for the 57 ACMG recommended genes based on a classification system. At the individual level, 21% of the individuals were found to have at least one reported pathogenic allele. We then conducted a literature survey to review the variants and to check for evidence of pathogenicity. Our results suggest that a substantial number of people have reported pathogenic alleles for the ACMG genes, and reviewing variants is indispensable for constructing the information infrastructure of genomic medicine for the Japanese population.

AB AIM: Precision oncology involves molecularly matching patients to targeted agents usually in early drug development (EDD) programs. Molecular profiling (MP) identifies actionable targets. Comprehensive commercial MP platforms are costly and in resource limited environments, a more practical approach to MP is necessary to support EDD and precision oncology. We adopted a clinician-directed, tailored approach to MP to enrol patients onto molecularly targeted trials. We report the feasibility of this approach.; METHODS: All patients referred to the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) EDD between September 2013 and September 2015 were identified in a prospective database. Key captured data included clinicopathological data, MP platform ordered (if any), molecular targets identified and subsequent enrolment onto clinical trials. EDD-clinician decisions to order MP and the platform utilized was guided by patient consultation, tumor type, trial availability and requirement for molecular information.; RESULTS: We identified 377 patients referred to RMH EDD. A total of 216 (57%) had MP ordered. The remainder had known actionable targets (19%), or were inappropriate for clinical trials (24%). In those undergoing MP, 187 genetic aberrations were found in 113 patients with 98 considered actionable targets in 86 patients. Ninety-eight (25%) patients were enrolled onto a clinical trial, including 40 (11%) receiving molecularly matched treatments. Median progression-free survival was improved in patients enrolled onto molecularly matched trials compared to those on unmatched trials (3.6 months vs 1.9 months, HR 0.58 [0.38-0.89], P = 0.013).; CONCLUSION: A clinician-directed, tailored approach to the use of MP is feasible, resulting in 11% of patients enrolled onto molecularly matched trials. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB Developments in breast cancer biology over the last years have permitted deconstructing the molecular profile of the most relevant breast cancer subtypes. This has led to an increase in therapeutic options, including more effective personalized therapy for breast cancer and substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Although currently there are only a few targeted therapies approved for metastatic breast cancer, the discovery of druggable kinase gene alterations has radically changed cancer treatment by providing novel and successfully actionable drug targets. Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors (FGFRs) participate in different physiologic processes and also play an essential role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. This article summarizes the main molecular alterations of FGFRs, as well as the available preclinical and clinical data with FGFR inhibitors in breast cancer, and discusses new opportunities for the clinical development of these agents in patients with breast cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Maternal sepsis is the underlying cause of 11% of all maternal deaths and a significant contributor to many deaths attributed to other underlying conditions. The effective prevention, early identification and adequate management of maternal and neonatal infections and sepsis can contribute to reducing the burden of infection as an underlying and contributing cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of the Global Maternal Sepsis Study (GLOSS) include: the development and validation of identification criteria for possible severe maternal infection and maternal sepsis; assessment of the frequency of use of a core set of practices recommended for prevention, early identification and management of maternal sepsis; further understanding of mother-to-child transmission of bacterial infection; assessment of the level of awareness about maternal and neonatal sepsis among health care providers; and establishment of a network of health care facilities to implement quality improvement strategies for better identification and management of maternal and early neonatal sepsis.; METHODS: This is a facility-based, prospective, one-week inception cohort study. This study will be implemented in health care facilities located in pre-specified geographical areas of participating countries across the WHO regions of Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South East Asia, and Western Pacific. During a seven-day period, all women admitted to or already hospitalised in participating facilities with suspected or confirmed infection during any stage of pregnancy through the 42nd day after abortion or childbirth will be included in the study. Included women will be followed during their stay in the facilities until hospital discharge, death or transfer to another health facility. The maximum intra-hospital follow-up period will be 42days.; DISCUSSION: GLOSS will provide a set of actionable criteria for identification of women with possible severe maternal infection and maternal sepsis. This study will provide data on the frequency of maternal sepsis and uptake of effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in obstetrics in different hospitals and countries. We will also be able to explore links between interventions and maternal and perinatal outcomes and identify priority areas for action.

AB Cancer treatment for elderly patients is often complicated by poor physical condition, impaired functioning and comorbidities. Patient reported health related quality of life (HRQOL) can contribute to decisions about treatment goals and supportive therapy. Knowledge about factors influencing HRQOL is therefore needed for the development of supportive measures and care pathways. An exploratory secondary data analysis on 518 assessments of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the elderly module (EORTC QLQ-ELD14) was performed to identify factors predictive for global HRQOL. Preliminary simple and multivariable regression analyses were conducted resulting in a final model comprising sociodemographic and disease specific variables and scales of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-ELD14. Age, sex and disease related variables explained only part of the variance of global HRQOL (adjusted R2 = 0.203). In the final model (adjusted R2 = 0.504) fatigue, social function, burden of illness and joint stiffness showed possible influence on global HRQOL. Fatigue, social function and burden of illness seem to have the largest impact on global HRQOL of elderly cancer patients. Further prospective studies should examine these domains. Actionable symptoms should be given special attention to initiate targeted supportive measures aiming to maximize HRQOL of older cancer patients.

AB There has been little improvement in the prognosis for adolescent and young adult (AYA) tumor patients. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the etiology of tumor development and identify actionable gene aberrations to improve prevention and therapy. Here, 76 sporadic tumors (48 breast, 22 ovarian, and six uterine) from 76 AYA females (age range, 25-39 years) were subjected to whole exome and RNA sequencing to determine their mutational signatures and actionable gene profiles. Two individuals with breast cancer (4.2% of cases) and one with ovarian cancer (5.3% of cases) carried germline BRCA2 mutations. The two cases with breast tumors also each carried an additional deleterious germline mutation: one in TP53 and the other in CHEK2. Mutational signature analysis of the 76 tumors indicated that spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine and activity of the APOBEC cytidine deaminase protein family are major causes of mutagenesis. In addition, 18 breast or ovarian tumors (18/70, 26%), including the three cases with germline BRCA2 mutations, exhibited a predominant "BRCAness" mutational signature, an indicator of functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. Actionable aberrations and high tumor mutation burdens were detected in 24 breast (50%), 17 ovarian (77%), and five uterine (83%) tumor cases. Thus, mutational processes and aberrant genes in AYA tumors are largely shared with those identified in non-AYA tumors. The efficacy of molecular targeting and immune checkpoint inhibitory therapies should be explored for both AYA and non-AYA patients.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring the safety of structures. A shift of SHM research away from traditional wired methods toward the use of wireless smart sensors (WSS) has been motivated by the attractive features of wireless smart sensor networks (WSSN). The progress achieved in Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technologies and wireless data transmission, has extended the effectiveness and range of applicability of WSSNs. One of the most common sensors employed in SHM strategies is the accelerometer; however, most accelerometers in WSS nodes have inadequate resolution for measurement of the typical accelerations found in many SHM applications. In this study, a high-resolution and low-noise tri-axial digital MEMS accelerometer is incorporated in a next-generation WSS platform, the Xnode. In addition to meeting the acceleration sensing demands of large-scale civil infrastructure applications, this new WSS node provides powerful hardware and a robust software framework to enable edge computing that can deliver actionable information. Hardware and software integration challenges are presented, and the associate resolutions are discussed. The performance of the wireless accelerometer is demonstrated experimentally through comparison with high-sensitivity wired accelerometers. This new high-sensitivity wireless accelerometer will extend the use of WSSN to a broader class of SHM applications.

AB Machine learning uses experimental data to optimize clustering or classification of samples or features, or to develop, augment or verify models that can be used to predict behavior or properties of systems. It is expected that machine learning will help provide actionable knowledge from a variety of big data including metabolomics data, as well as results of metabolism models. A variety of machine learning methods has been applied in bioinformatics and metabolism analyses including self-organizing maps, support vector machines, the kernel machine, Bayesian networks or fuzzy logic. To a lesser extent, machine learning has also been utilized to take advantage of the increasing availability of genomics and metabolomics data for the optimization of metabolic network models and their analysis. In this context, machine learning has aided the development of metabolic networks, the calculation of parameters for stoichiometric and kinetic models, as well as the analysis of major features in the model for the optimal application of bioreactors. Examples of this very interesting, albeit highly complex, application of machine learning for metabolism modeling will be the primary focus of this review presenting several different types of applications for model optimization, parameter determination or system analysis using models, as well as the utilization of several different types of machine learning technologies.

AB Importance: Among patients who undergo the 21-gene assay (21-GA), 39% to 67% receive an intermediate risk result and may receive ambiguous treatment guidance. The 70-gene signature assay (70-GS) may be associated with physicians' treatment decisions in this population with early breast cancer.; Objective: To determine whether 70-GS findings are associated with physicians' decisions about adjuvant treatment and confidence in their recommendations and to evaluate the dichotomous (high- vs low-risk) and continuous distribution of 70-GS indices among this group of patients with intermediate risk.; Design, Setting, and Participants: The Prospective Study of MammaPrint in Breast Cancer Patients With an Intermediate Recurrence Score (PROMIS trial) was an impact study conducted from May 20, 2012, through December 31, 2015, that enrolled 840 patients with early-stage breast cancer and a 21-gene assay recurrence score of 18 to 30. Patients were treated in 58 US institutions.; Interventions: The 70-GS result was given to physicians before adjuvant treatment.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physician treatment decision before vs after receiving the 70-GS result. With a treatment change of greater than 20%, the odds ratio (OR) was applied.; Results: Among the 840 patients who underwent 70-GS classification (mean age, 59 years; range, 27-93 years), 374 (44.5%) had a low-risk and 466 (55.5%) had a high-risk result. The distribution of 70-GS indices did not correlate with recurrence score within the 21-GA intermediate range, with 70-GS low- and high-risk patients observed at every recurrence score. A significant change in adjuvant treatment was associated with receiving the 70-GS classifications with an OR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.82; McNemar test, P<.001) for all patients. Among the low-risk patients, 108 of 374 (28.9%) had chemotherapy removed from their treatment recommendation; among the high-risk patients, 171 of 466 (36.7%) had chemotherapy added. Results of the 70-GS were associated with the physician's adjuvant treatment recommendation; 409 high-risk patients (87.8%) were recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, and 339 low-risk patients (90.6%) were recommended no chemotherapy. Physicians reported having greater confidence in their treatment recommendation in 660 cases (78.6%) based on 70-GS results.; Conclusions and Relevance: The 70-GS provides clinically actionable information regarding patients classified as intermediate risk by the 21-GA and was associated with a change in treatment decision in 282 of these patients (33.6%). Chemotherapy was added or withheld by the treating physician based on the results of the 70-GS test. Physicians reported more confidence with their treatment recommendation after receiving 70-GS results.

AB Liver metastasis is the major cause of death following a diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we compared the copy number profiles of paired primary and liver metastatic CRC to better understand how the genomic structure of primary CRC differs from the metastasis. Paired primary and metastatic tumors from 16 patients and their adjacent normal tissue samples were analyzed using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Genome-wide chromosomal copy number alterations were assessed, with particular attention to 188 genes known to be somatically altered in CRC and 24 genes that are clinically actionable in CRC. These data were analyzed with respect to the timing of primary and metastatic tissue resection and with exposure to chemotherapy. The genomic differences between the tumor and paired metastases revealed an average copy number discordance of 22.0%. The pairs of tumor samples collected prior to treatment revealed significantly higher copy number differences compared to post-therapy liver metastases (P = 0.014). Loss of heterozygosity acquired in liver metastases was significantly higher in previously treated liver metastasis samples compared to treatment naive liver metastasis samples (P = 0.003). Amplification of the clinically actionable genes ERBB2, FGFR1, PIK3CA or CDK8 was observed in the metastatic tissue of 4 patients but not in the paired primary CRC. These examples highlight the intra-patient genomic discrepancies that can occur between metastases and the primary tumors from which they arose. We propose that precision medicine strategies may therefore identify different actionable targets in metastatic tissue, compared to primary tumors, due to substantial genomic differences.

AB Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has high mortality rates, perhaps reflecting a lack of understanding of the molecular diversity in various subtypes and a lack of known actionable targets. There are currently 12 open clinical trials for AML using combination therapeutic modalities including all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Mutant nucleophosmin-1, proposed as a possible marker for RA response, is the criterion for recruiting patients in three active RA phase 3 clinical trials. We tested the ability of RA alone or in combination with either bosutinib (B) or 6-formylindolo(3,2-b) carbazole (F) to induce conversion of 12 de novo AML samples toward a more differentiated phenotype. We assessed levels of expression of cell surface markers associated with differentiation, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and glucose uptake activity. Colony formation capacity was reduced with the combined treatment of RA and B or F, and correlated with modulation of a c-Cbl/Lyn/c-Raf-centered signalsome. Combination treatment was in most cases more effective than RA alone. Based on their responses to the treatments, some primary leukemic samples cluster closer to HL-60 cells than to other primary samples, suggesting that they may represent a hitherto undefined AML subtype that is potentially responsive to RA in a combination differentiation therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks pose major challenges to public health around the world, leading to thousands of deaths a year in the United States alone. Accurate systems that track influenza activity at the city level are necessary to provide actionable information that can be used for clinical, hospital, and community outbreak preparation.; OBJECTIVE: Although Internet-based real-time data sources such as Google searches and tweets have been successfully used to produce influenza activity estimates ahead of traditional health care-based systems at national and state levels, influenza tracking and forecasting at finer spatial resolutions, such as the city level, remain an open question. Our study aimed to present a precise, near real-time methodology capable of producing influenza estimates ahead of those collected and published by the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) for the Boston metropolitan area. This approach has great potential to be extended to other cities with access to similar data sources.; METHODS: We first tested the ability of Google searches, Twitter posts, electronic health records, and a crowd-sourced influenza reporting system to detect influenza activity in the Boston metropolis separately. We then adapted a multivariate dynamic regression method named ARGO (autoregression with general online information), designed for tracking influenza at the national level, and showed that it effectively uses the above data sources to monitor and forecast influenza at the city level 1 week ahead of the current date. Finally, we presented an ensemble-based approach capable of combining information from models based on multiple data sources to more robustly nowcast as well as forecast influenza activity in the Boston metropolitan area. The performances of our models were evaluated in an out-of-sample fashion over 4 influenza seasons within 2012-2016, as well as a holdout validation period from 2016 to 2017.; RESULTS: Our ensemble-based methods incorporating information from diverse models based on multiple data sources, including ARGO, produced the most robust and accurate results. The observed Pearson correlations between our out-of-sample flu activity estimates and those historically reported by the BPHC were 0.98 in nowcasting influenza and 0.94 in forecasting influenza 1 week ahead of the current date.; CONCLUSIONS: We show that information from Internet-based data sources, when combined using an informed, robust methodology, can be effectively used as early indicators of influenza activity at fine geographic resolutions. ©Fred Sun Lu, Suqin Hou, Kristin Baltrusaitis, Manan Shah, Jure Leskovec, Rok Sosic, Jared Hawkins, John Brownstein, Giuseppe Conidi, Julia Gunn, Josh Gray, Anna Zink, Mauricio Santillana.

We investigated the gene alterations and the immunoexpression of crucial oncogenic molecules in 151 SDCs. The mutation rates that were identified, in order of frequency, were as follows: TP53, 68%; PIK3CA, 18%; H-RAS, 16%; BRAF, 4%; and AKT1, 1.5%. PIK3CA/H-RAS/BRAF mutations were more common in de novo SDC than in SDC ex-pleomorphic adenoma. Furthermore, these mutations were mutually exclusive for HER2 overexpression/amplification. TP53 mutations were frequently detected in cases with the aberrant p53 expression, and TP53 missense and truncating mutations were associated with p53-extreme positivity and negativity, respectively. DISH analysis revealed no cases of EGFR amplification. The rates of PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR positivity were 34%, 22%, and 66%, respectively; PTEN loss was observed in 47% of the cases. These expressions were correlated according to the signaling axis. Cases with PI3K negativity and PTEN loss appeared to show a lower expression of androgen receptor. In the multivariate analysis, patients with SDC harboring TP53 truncating mutations showed shorter progression-free survival. Conversely, p-Akt positivity was associated with a favorable outcome. This study might provide information that leads to advances in personized therapy for SDC.

AB We examined the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process at 9 academic institutions in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, for proposed electronic health record-based genomic medicine studies, to identify common questions and concerns. Sequencing of 109 disease related genes and genotyping of 14 actionable variants is being performed in ~28,100 participants from the 9 sites. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in actionable genes are being returned to study participants. We examined each site's research protocols, informed-consent materials, and interactions with IRB staff. Research staff at each site completed questionnaires regarding their IRB interactions. The time to prepare protocols for IRB submission, number of revisions and time to approval ranged from 10-261 days, 0-11, and 11-90 days, respectively. IRB recommendations related to the readability of informed consent materials, specifying the full range of potential risks, providing options for receiving limited results or withdrawal, sharing of information with family members, and establishing the mechanisms to answer participant questions. IRBs reviewing studies that involve the return of results from genomic sequencing have a diverse array of concerns, and anticipating these concerns can help investigators to more effectively engage IRBs.

AB Primary aldosteronism affects 5% to 10% of hypertensive patients and has unilateral and bilateral forms. Most unilateral primary aldosteronism is caused by computed tomography-detectable aldosterone-producing adenomas, which express CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) and frequently harbor somatic mutations in aldosterone-regulating genes. The cause of the most common bilateral form of primary aldosteronism, idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA), is believed to be diffuse hyperplasia of aldosterone-producing cells within the adrenal cortex. Herein, a multi-institution cohort of 15 IHA adrenals was examined with CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. CYP11B2 immunoreactivity in adrenal glomerulosa harboring non-nodular hyperplasia was only observed in 4/15 IHA adrenals suggesting that hyperplasia of CYP11B2-expressing cells may not be the major cause of IHA. However, the adrenal cortex of all IHA adrenals harbored at least 1 CYP11B2-positive aldosterone-producing cell cluster (APCC) or micro-aldosterone-producing adenomas. The number of APCCs per case (and individual APCC area) in IHA adrenals was significantly larger than in normotensive controls. Next-generation sequencing of DNA from 99 IHA APCCs demonstrated somatic mutations in genes encoding the L-type calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha 1-D ( CACNA1D, n=57; 58%) and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J-5 ( KCNJ5, n=1; 1%). These data suggest that IHA may result from not only hyperplasia but also the accumulation or enlargement of computed tomography-undetectable APCC harboring somatic aldosterone-driver gene mutations. The high prevalence of mutations in the CACNA1D L-type calcium channel provides a potential actionable therapeutic target that could complement mineralocorticoid blockade and inhibit aldosterone overproduction in some IHA patients.

AB Innovation is needed to improve care of the seriously ill, and there are important opportunities as we transition from a volume- to value-based payment system. Not all seriously ill are dying; some recover, while others are persistently functionally impaired. While we innovate in service delivery and payment models for the seriously ill, it is important that we concurrently develop accountability that ensures a focus on high-quality care rather than narrowly focusing on cost containment. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation convened a meeting of 45 experts to arrive at guiding principles for measurement, create a starter measurement set, specify a proposed definition of the denominator and its refinement, and identify research priorities for future implementation of the accountability system. A series of articles written by experts provided the basis for debate and guidance in formulating a path forward to develop an accountability system for community-based programs for the seriously ill, outlined in this article. As we innovate in existing population-based payment programs such as Medicare Advantage and develop new alternative payment models, it is important and urgent that we develop the foundation for accountability along with actionable measures so that the healthcare system ensures high-quality person- and family-centered care for persons who are seriously ill.

AB PURPOSE: In an effort to counteract the differences in improvement in survival rates of adolescents and young adults (AYA), compared to other age groups with cancer, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics established an AYA cancer program. This study was conducted to gather feedback from AYAs in an effort to generate actionable data for program development.; METHODS: The target population included patients aged 13-31 treated for malignancy in one of the following disease sites: central nervous system, leukemia, lymphoma, neuroendocrine, sarcoma, and thyroid. A series of four focus groups was held to identify and describe gaps in care and provide suggestions for program development. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Qualitative data were derived from focus group discussion and free-response survey questions, while quantitative data were derived from objective survey questions and electronic medical record data.; RESULTS: Across the four focus groups, 24 different AYAs participated, ranging from 8 to 19 individuals per session. Topics discussed included the following: communication, treatment experience, and overall AYA program; finances, work and school, and late effects; relationships, emotions, and spirituality; and body image, infertility, sexuality, risky behavior, and suicide. The results of the analyses corroborated what makes AYAs different from other age groups. The primary theme identified was the unique relationships of AYAs, which can be thought of along a continuum.; CONCLUSIONS: Information obtained from these analyses has been used to inform specific projects within the development of the AYA program to address patient-identified gaps. For AYAs, the importance of relationships along a continuum should be considered when developing an AYA program, in addition to potential policy or health service research utilization in the future.

AB Safe performance limits of soldiers and athletes have typically relied on predictive work-rest models of ambient conditions, average work intensity, and characteristics of the population. Bioengineering advances in noninvasive sensor technologies, including miniaturization, reduced cost, power requirements, and comfort, now make it possible to produce individual predictions of safe thermal-work limits. These precision medicine assessments depend on the development of thoughtful algorithms based on physics and physiology. Both physiological telemetry and thermal-strain indexes have been available for >50 years, but greater computing power and better wearable sensors now make it possible to provide actionable information at the individual level. Core temperature can be practically estimated from time series heart rate data and, using an adaptive physiological strain index, provides meaningful predictions of safe work limits that cannot be predicted from only core temperature or heart rate measurements. Early adopters of this technology include specialized occupations where individuals operate in complete encapsulation such as chemical protective suits. Emerging technologies that focus on heat flux measurements at the skin show even greater potential for estimating thermal-work strain using a parsimonious sensor set. Applications of these wearable technologies include many sports and military training venues where inexperienced individuals can learn effective work pacing strategies and train to safe personal limits. The same strategies can also provide a technologically based performance edge for experienced workers and athletes faced with novel and nonintuitive physiological challenges, such as health care providers in full protective clothing treating Ebola patients in West Africa in 2014. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This mini-review details how the application of computational techniques borrowed from signal processing and control theory can provide meaningful advances for the applied physiological problem of real-time thermal-work strain monitoring. The work examines the development of practical core body temperature estimation techniques and how these can be used in combination with current and updated thermal-work strain indexes to provide objective state assessments and to optimize work rest schedules for a given task.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic testing is increasingly performed in oncology, but concerns remain regarding the clinician's ability to interpret results. In the current study, the authors sought to determine the agreement between physicians and genomic annotators from the Precision Oncology Decision Support (PODS) team at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston regarding actionability and the clinical use of test results.; METHODS: On a prospective protocol, patients underwent clinical genomic testing for hotspot mutations in 46 or 50 genes. Six months after sequencing, physicians received questionnaires for patients who demonstrated a variant in an actionable gene, investigating their perceptions regarding the actionability of alterations and clinical use of these findings. Genomic annotators independently classified these variants as actionable, potentially actionable, unknown, or not actionable.; RESULTS: Physicians completed 250 of 288 questionnaires (87% response rate). Physicians considered 168 of 250 patients (67%) as having an actionable alteration; of these, 165 patients (98%) were considered to have an actionable alteration by the PODS team and 3 were of unknown significance. Physicians were aware of genotype-matched therapy available for 119 patients (71%) and 48 of these 119 patients (40%) received matched therapy. Approximately 46% of patients in whom physicians regarded alterations as not actionable (36 of 79 patients) were classified as having an actionable/potentially actionable mutation by the PODS team. However, many of these were only theoretically actionable due to limited trials and/or therapies (eg, KRAS).; CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are aware of recurrent mutations in actionable genes on "hotspot" panels. As larger genomic panels are used, there may be a growing need for annotation of actionability.

AB BACKGROUND: Metastatic biopsies are increasingly being performed in patients with advanced prostate cancer to search for actionable targets and/or to identify emerging resistance mechanisms. Due to a predominance of bone metastases and their sclerotic nature, obtaining sufficient tissue for clinical and genomic studies is challenging.; METHODS: Patients with prostate cancer bone metastases were enrolled between February 2013 and March 2017 on an institutional review board-approved protocol for prospective image-guided bone biopsy. Bone biopsies and blood clots were collected fresh. Compact bone was subjected to formalin with a decalcifying agent for diagnosis; bone marrow and blood clots were frozen in optimum cutting temperature formulation for next-generation sequencing. Frozen slides were cut from optimum cutting temperature cryomolds and evaluated for tumor histology and purity. Tissue was macrodissected for DNA and RNA extraction, and whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing were performed.; RESULTS: Seventy bone biopsies from 64 patients were performed. Diagnostic material confirming prostate cancer was successful in 60 of 70 cases (85.7%). The median DNA/RNA yield was 25.5ng/muL and 16.2ng/muL, respectively. Whole-exome sequencing was performed successfully in 49 of 60 cases (81.7%), with additional RNA sequencing performed in 20 of 60 cases (33.3%). Recurrent alterations were as expected, including those involving the AR, PTEN, TP53, BRCA2, and SPOP genes.; CONCLUSIONS: This prostate cancer bone biopsy protocol ensures a valuable source for high-quality DNA and RNA for tumor sequencing and may be used to detect actionable alterations and resistance mechanisms in patients with bone metastases.

AB Deregulated HER2 is a target of many approved cancer drugs. We analyzed 111,176 patient tumors and identified recurrent mutations in HER2 transmembrane domain (TMD) and juxtamembrane domain (JMD) that include G660D, R678Q, E693K, and Q709L. Using a saturation mutagenesis screen and testing of patient-derived mutations we found several activating TMD and JMD mutations. Structural modeling and analysis showed that the TMD/JMD mutations function by improving the active dimer interface or stabilizing an activating conformation. Further, we found that HER2 G660D employed asymmetric kinase dimerization for activation and signaling. Importantly, anti-HER2 antibodies and small-molecule kinase inhibitors blocked the activity of TMD/JMD mutants. Consistent with this, a G660D germline mutant lung cancer patient showed remarkable clinical response to HER2 blockade. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal mortality. Genetic heart diseases (GHDs) underlie some cases of SIDS.; OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the spectrum and prevalence of GHD-associated mutations as a potential monogenic basis for SIDS.; METHODS: A cohort of 419 unrelated SIDS cases (257 male; average age 2.7 ± 1.9months) underwent whole exome sequencing and a targeted analysis of 90 GHD-susceptibility genes. The yield of "potentially informative," ultra-rare variants (minor allele frequency<0.00005) in GHD-associated genes was assessed.; RESULTS: Overall, 53 of 419 (12.6%) SIDS cases had≥1 "potentially informative," GHD-associated variant. The yield was 14.9% (21 of 141) for mixed-European ancestry cases and 11.5% (32 of 278) for European ancestry SIDS cases. Infantsolder than 4months were more likely to host a "potentially informative" GHD-associated variant. There was significant overrepresentation of ultra-rare nonsynonymous variants in European SIDS cases (18 of 278 [6.5%]) versus European control subjects (30 of 973 [3.1%]; p=0.013) when combining all 4 major cardiac channelopathy genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, and RYR2). According to the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines, only 18 of 419(4.3%) SIDS cases hosted a "pathogenic" or "likely pathogenic" variant.; CONCLUSIONS: Less than 15% of more than 400 SIDS cases had a "potentially informative" variant in a GHD-susceptibility gene, predominantly in the 4- to 12-month age group. Only 4.3% of cases possessed immediately clinically actionablevariants. Consistent with previous studies, ultra-rare, nonsynonymous variants within the major cardiac channelopathy-associated genes were overrepresented in SIDS cases in infants of European ethnicity. These findings havemajor implications for the investigation of SIDS cases and families. Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Historically, health literacy has been viewed as the patient's problem; however, it is now accepted that the responsibility for improving health literacy lies with the health care professionals and systems. An Institute of Medicine report outlines the health literacy attributes, such as printed patient education and technology, which both play a role in patient decision-making and engaging them in their health care. Research suggests that patients who are engaged in their health care have improved health outcomes. For health care organizations to accommodate the needs of all patients, it is imperative that they determine the current organizational state and discover opportunities for improvement.; Methods: The Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers (HLEHHC) Print Communication Rating and Technology Rating Tool were used to measure the internal aspects of organizational health literacy at The University of Tennessee Medical Center (UTMC). Included in the print assessment were the 150 most distributed patient education handouts. Researchers also used the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool to assess print material. Technology was assessed using UTMC's website as the authoritative source.; Key Results: The HLEHHC was useful for assessing print material and technology. Reviewing and reporting the data question-by-question revealed more granular, actionable information on where there are opportunities to improve the health care environment for all patients. This analysis resulted in proposing actions based on best practices that UTMC could implement in the coming year. The process is replicable in other settings.; Implications: Responsibility for improving informed medical decision-making lies with health care organizations. Low health literacy influences the effectiveness of print patient education and technology in informing patients about their health. Assessing these aspects of the health care organization as part of quality improvement provides necessary data for improvements. The Health Literacy Environment of Hospital and Health Centers was a useful tool to measure characteristics of print and technology. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2018;2(1):e26-e34.].; Plain Language Summary: A task force at an academic medical center assessed the health literacy attributes of their organization. Researchers assessed print patient education and patient-related technology. The researchers found areas for improvements to make health information easier to understand.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the concordance of self-reported responses to oral health questions versus clinically evaluated recommended need for oral healthcare by calibrated dentists to determine usefulness of the questions for epidemiological studies. We additionally examined other factors associated with concordant self-reports versus clinical evaluations.; Materials and Methods: We used a cross-sectional study design with 4,205 participants, ages 30 years and above, who had complete oral health self-perception data and dental referral data in the NHANES 2013-14. Calibrated dentists completed clinical oral healthcare assessments. The assessments were dichotomized to (1) recommendation for immediate care and (2) routine oral health care. Self-reported oral health needs were measured with 6 items (an overall oral health self-perception question, oral pain within the previous year, impact on job/school, suspected periodontal disease, tooth appearance, and tooth mobility). The key item of interest was the overall oral health self-perception question.; Results: Concordance with clinically evaluated recommended need for oral healthcare varied from 52.0% (oral pain) to 65.4% (overall oral health self-perception). Many subgroup differences were observed.; Conclusions: The overall self-perception of oral health and the clinical evaluation of oral healthcare need were substantially concordant; other self-reported measures were moderately concordant. This is useful information and points to the need for a minimum set of measures that can provide actionable information and capture the need for clinical dental care.

AB As climate change research becomes increasingly applied, the need for actionable information is growing rapidly. A key aspect of this requirement is the representation of uncertainties. The conventional approach to representing uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change is probabilistic, based on ensembles of climate model simulations. In the face of deep uncertainties, the known limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent. An alternative is thus emerging which may be called a 'storyline' approach. We define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. No a priori probability of the storyline is assessed; emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved, and the plausibility of those factors. We introduce a typology of four reasons for using storylines to represent uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change: (i) improving risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner, which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk; (ii) strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests; (iii) providing a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner and (iv) exploring the boundaries of plausibility, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise. Storylines also offer a powerful way of linking physical with human aspects of climate change.

AB Purpose: Patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) have a significantly increased risk of developing upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Here, we sought to identify differences in the patterns of mutational changes in LS-associated versus sporadic UTUCs.; Patients and Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of 17 UTUCs from patients with documented LS-associated germline mutations (LS-UTUCs) using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Molecular Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets targeted exon capture assay and compared the results with those from a recently characterized cohort of 82 patients with sporadic UTUC.; Results: Patients with LS-UTUC were significantly younger, had had less exposure to tobacco, and more often presented with a ureteral primary site compared with patients with sporadic UTUC. The median number of mutations per tumor was significantly greater in LS-UTUC tumors than in tumors from the sporadic cohort (58; interquartile range [IQR], 47-101 v 6; IQR, 4-10; P < .001), as was the MSIsensor score (median, 25.1; IQR, 17.9-31.2 v 0.03; IQR, 0-0.44; P < .001). Differences in the genetic landscape were observed between sporadic and LS-associated tumors. Alterations in KMT2D, CREBBP, or ARID1A or in DNA damage response and repair genes were present at a significantly higher frequency in LS-UTUC. CIC, NOTCH1, NOTCH3, RB1, and CDKN1B alterations were almost exclusive to LS-UTUC. Although FGFR3 mutations were identified in both cohorts, the R248C hotspot mutation was highly enriched in LS-UTUC.; Conclusion: LSand sporadic UTUCs have overlapping but distinct genetic signatures. LS-UTUC is associated with hypermutation and a significantly higher prevalence of FGFR3 R248C mutation. Prospective molecular characterization of patients to identify those with LS-UTUC may help guide treatment.

AB After ambulatory surgeries, patients who recover at home have multiple questions about wound healing, symptoms and medication side effects, and recovery expectations. We conducted user testing and rapid application development of a newly developed symptom reporting system that supports home-based recovery by inviting patients to self-report symptoms in the days after surgery and then receive an immediate feedback report giving context for their reported symptoms. Findings showed that some participants primarily valued reassurance, whereas others prioritized receiving alerts about potential problems. Results also showed that most patients wanted feedback framed as comparing their progress to their expected progress, not to that of other patients. The final feedback report provided patients with actionable recommendations, small graphs showing their progress, and with short "gist" text interpretations. The system has been implemented, and recruitment is ongoing for a large clinical trial of its effectiveness for reducing adverse events and unnecessary emergency or urgent care visits.

AB We designed five novel collaborative health reminders using data-driven low-fidelity prototyping methods. Each collaborative reminder-Symbolic Reminder Band, Social Reminder App, Reminder Invitation, Conversation Reminder, and Actionable Notification-was designed for patients to engage, discuss, and share their health information for collaboration on health tasks. We conducted evaluations with 11 patients and caregivers: six patients with type 2 diabetes, and five mothers of children with asthma. We found that participants valued these reminders for enhancing the patient-provider relationship, supporting shared action on health tasks, and promoting social support. We contribute design implications for collaborative health reminders that enhance patient-centered care.

AB Background: Liquid biopsy (LB) captures dynamic genomic alterations (alts) across metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) therapy and may complement tissue biopsy (TB). We sought to describe the utility of LB and better understand mCRC biology during therapy. Methods: Thirty-three patients (pts) with mCRC underwent LB. We used permutation-based t-tests to assess associations between alts, and clinical variables and used Kendall's tau to measure correlations. Results: Of 33 pts, 15 were women; 22 had colon, and the rest rectal cancer. Pts received a median of two lines of therapy before LB. Nineteen pts had limited testing on TB (RAS/RAF/TP53/APC), 11 extended NGS, and 3 no TB. Maxpct and alts correlated with CEA (p < 0.001, respectively). In 3/5 pts with serial LB, CEA correlated with maxpct trend, and CT tumor burden. In 6 pts, mutant RAS was seen in LB and not TB; 5/6 had received anti-EGFR therapy prior to LB, suggesting RAS alts developed post-therapy. In two pts RAS-mutated by TB, no RAS alts were detected on LB; these pts had low disease burden on CT at time of LB that also did not reveal APC or TP53 alts. In six patients who were KRAS wt based on TB, post anti-EGFR LB revealed subclonal KRAS mutations, likely a treatment effect. The median number of alts was higher post anti-EGFR LB (n = 12) vs. anti-EGFR naive LB (n = 22) (9.5 vs. 5.5, p = 0.059) but not statistically significant. More alts were also noted in post anti-EGFR therapy LB vs. KRAS wt anti-EGFR-naive LB (n = 6) (9.5 vs. 5) among patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.182). Conclusions: LB across mCRC therapy detects driver mutations, monitors disease burden, and identifies sub-clonal alts that reflect drug resistance, tumor evolution, and heterogeneity. Interpretation of LB results is impacted by clinical context.

AB This article studies how six key aid effectiveness principles for "Hitting the bull's eye" can bring about the scale up of maternal and newborn health (MNH) interventions. These key principles are based on accepted international agreements such as the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The results indicate that the six principles should be a guide for recipient countries to take ownership of the development process and work with donors to plan effective coordination structures. Countries that take ownership will be able to work with donors and implementers to not only test new interventions that address pressing challenges to deliver quality MNH care but also include the successful knowledge transfer and handover of these interventions, the effective integration of the new intervention as part of the country's health system and a costed scale-up plan. The article could have been strengthened with clear and actionable recommendations for the three countries to improve their ownership of donor-funded assistance, but it showed that there is need to change how aid is delivered and that embracing and applying these principles will help countries take ownership of MNH programs and lead the dialog and effective scale up with those involved. The authors should be commended on taking the lead in the field of aid effectiveness, and encouraged to conduct quantitative and further qualitative measurements of the application of their findings in the three counties included in the study. © 2018 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

AB Creativity is critical to organizational success. Understanding the antecedents of creativity is important. Although there is a growing body of research on how (mixed) emotions affect creativity, most of the work has focused on intrapersonal processes. We do not know whether contrasting emotions between interacting partners (i.e., interpersonal mixed emotions) have creative consequences. Building on information processing theories of emotion, our research proposes a theoretical account for why interpersonal mixed emotions matter. It hypothesized that mixed- (vs. same-) emotion interactions would predict higher collective creative performance. We tested the hypothesis in two-party integrative negotiations (105 dyads). We manipulated negotiators' emotional expressions (angry-angry, happy-happy, angry-happy dyads) and measured the extent to which they generated creative solutions that tapped into hidden integrative potential in the negotiation for a better joint gain. The results overall supported the hypothesis: (i) there was some evidence that mixed-emotion dyads (i.e., angry-happy) performed better than same-emotion dyads; (ii) mixed-emotion dyads, on average, achieved a high level of joint gain that exceeded the (non-creative) zero-sum threshold, whereas same-emotion dyads did not. The findings add theoretical and actionable insights into our understanding of creativity, emotion, and organization behavior.

AB Purpose: We assessed the usefulness of real-time molecular profiling through next-generation sequencing (NGS) in predicting the tumor biology of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) and in characterizing genomic evolution.; Methods: Patients with metastatic panNETs were recruited in the routine clinical practice setting (between May 2014 and March 2017) for prospective NGS of their tumors as well as for germline analysis using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) sequencing platform. When possible, NGS was performed at multiple time points.; Results: NGS was performed in 96 tumor samples from 80 patients. Somatic alterations were identified in 76 of 80 patients (95%). The most commonly altered genes were MEN1 (56%), DAXX (40%), ATRX (25%), and TSC2 (25%). Alterations could be defined in pathways that included chromatin remodeling factors, histone methyltransferases, and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway genes. Somatic loss of heterozygosity was particularly prevalent (50 of 96 samples [52%]), and the presence of loss of heterozygosity resulted in inferior overall survival (P < .01). Sequencing of pre- and post-treatment samples revealed tumor-grade progression; clonal evolution patterns were also seen (molecular resistance mechanisms and chemotherapy-associated mutagenesis). Germline genetic analysis identified clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 14 of 88 patients (16%), including mutations in high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes (MEN1, TSC2, and VHL).; Conclusion: A clinical NGS platform reveals pertubations of biologic pathways in metastatic panNETs that may inform prognosis and direct therapies. Repeat sequencing at disease progression reveals increasing tumor grade and genetic evolution, demonstrating that panNETs adopt a more aggressive behavior through time and therapies. In addition to frequent somatic mutations in MEN1 and TSC2, germline mutations in these same genes underlie susceptibility to panNETs and highlight the need to re-evaluate whether germline genetic analysis should be performed for all patients with panNETs.

AB PURPOSE: With rapidly evolving treatment options in cancer, the complexity in the clinical decision-making process for oncologists represents a growing challenge magnified by oncologists' disposition of intuition-based assessment of treatment risks and overall mortality. Given the unmet need for accurate prognostication with meaningful clinical rationale, we developed a highly interpretable prediction tool to identify patients with high mortality risk before the start of treatment regimens.; METHODS: We obtained electronic health record data between 2004 and 2014 from a large national cancer center and extracted 401 predictors, including demographics, diagnosis, gene mutations, treatment history, comorbidities, resource utilization, vital signs, and laboratory test results. We built an actionable tool using novel developments in modern machine learning to predict 60-, 90- and 180-day mortality from the start of an anticancer regimen. The model was validated in unseen data against benchmark models.; RESULTS: We identified 23,983 patients who initiated 46,646 anticancer treatment lines, with a median survival of 514 days. Our proposed prediction models achieved significantly higher estimation quality in unseen data (area under the curve, 0.83 to 0.86) compared with benchmark models. We identified key predictors of mortality, such as change in weight and albumin levels. The results are presented in an interactive and interpretable tool ( www.oncomortality.com ).; CONCLUSION: Our fully transparent prediction model was able to distinguish with high precision between highest- and lowest-risk patients. Given the rich data available in electronic health records and advances in machine learning methods, this tool can have significant implications for value-based shared decision making at the point of care and personalized goals-of-care management to catalyze practice reforms.

AB Importance: Detection of disease-associated variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes allows for cancer prevention and early diagnosis in high-risk individuals.; Objectives: To identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) BRCA1/2 variants in an unselected research cohort, and to characterize the features associated with P/LP variants.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cross-sectional study of adult volunteers (n=50 726) who underwent exome sequencing at a single health care system (Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania) from January 1, 2014, to March 1, 2016. Participants are part of the DiscovEHR cohort and were identified through the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative. They consented to a research protocol that included sequencing and return of actionable test results. Clinical data from electronic health records and clinical visits were correlated with variants. Comparisons were made between those with (cases) and those without (controls) P/LP variants in BRCA1/2.; Main Outcomes: Prevalence of P/LP BRCA1/2 variants in cohort, proportion of variant carriers not previously ascertained through clinical testing, and personal and family history of relevant cancers among BRCA1/2 variant carriers and noncarriers.; Results: Of the 50 726 health system patients who underwent exome sequencing, 50 459 (99.5%) had no expected pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants and 267 (0.5%) were BRCA1/2 carriers. Of the 267 cases (148 [55.4%] were women and 119 [44.6%] were men with a mean [range] age of 58.9 [23-90] years), 183 (68.5%) received clinically confirmed results in their electronic health record. Among the 267 participants with P/LP BRCA1/2 variants, 219 (82.0%) had no prior clinical testing, 95 (35.6%) had BRCA1 variants, and 172 (64.4%) had BRCA2 variants. Syndromic cancer diagnoses were present in 11 (47.8%) of the 23 deceased BRCA1/2 carriers and in 56 (20.9%) of all 267 BRCA1/2 carriers. Among women, 31 (20.9%) of 148 variant carriers had a personal history of breast cancer, compared with 1554 (5.2%) of 29 880 noncarriers (odds ratio [OR], 5.95; 95% CI, 3.88-9.13; P<.001). Ovarian cancer history was present in 15 (10.1%) of 148 variant carriers and in 195 (0.6%) of 29 880 variant noncarriers (OR, 18.30; 95% CI, 10.48-31.4; P<.001). Among 89 BRCA1/2 carriers without prior testing but with comprehensive personal and family history data, 44 (49.4%) did not meet published guidelines for clinical testing.; Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that compared with previous clinical care, exome sequencing-based screening identified 5 times as many individuals with P/LP BRCA1/2 variants. These findings suggest that genomic screening may identify BRCA1/2-associated cancer risk that might otherwise remain undetected within health care systems and may provide opportunities to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients.

AB PURPOSE: High-quality symptom management and supportive care are essential components of comprehensive cancer care. We aimed to describe the development of an evidence-based automated decisional algorithm for patients with cancer that had specific, actionable, clinical, evidence-based recommendations to improve patient care, communication, and management.; METHODS: We reviewed existing literature and clinical practice guidelines to identify priority domains of patient care and potential clinical recommendations. Two multidisciplinary clinical advisory groups used a two-stage consensus decision-making approach to determine domains of care and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures and subsequently developed automated algorithms with clear clinical recommendations amendable to intervention in clinical settings.; RESULTS: Algorithms were developed to inform management of patient symptoms, distress, and unmet needs. Three PRO measures were chosen: Distress Thermometer and problem checklist, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Screening Tool 9. PRO items were mapped to five domains of patient well-being: physical, emotional, practical, social and family, and maintenance of well-being. A total of 15 actionable clinical recommendations tailored to specific issues of concern were established.; CONCLUSION: Using automated algorithms and clinical recommendations provides a platform for streamlining and systematizing the use of PROs to inform risk-stratified guideline-informed care. The series of algorithms, which set out systematized care pathways for the clinical care of patients with cancer, can be used to potentially inform patient-centered care.

AB The US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration identifies recommendations within the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) General Duty Clause for establishing a safe and healthful workplace for all workers covered by the act. Employers that do not take reasonable steps to prevent or abate a recognised violence hazard in the workplace can be cited. While failure to implement various recommendations and guidelines provided by OSHA is not in itself a violation of the General Duty Clause, organisations that implement a workplace violence programme are providing defensible risk mitigation operations while enhancing the overall safety of their employees. Successful implementation of a workplace violence programme requires finesse and enhanced partnerships with multiple functional groups within the organisation. This paper provides proven steps to establish and operate a value-added corporate workplace violence programme that promotes identification and reporting of potential internal and external threats, ongoing evaluation and monitoring of threats, swift action to mitigate threats to the workplace, and actionable awareness, training and exercising components to provide employees with the necessary skills to detect, deter, respond to and recover from an actual workplace violence incident.

AB Background: The association between body mass index (BMI) and colorectal cancer is unique. There are several patient- and tumor-related factors that affect this and associations are not entirely clear. The primary aim of this study is to examine the association between BMI and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis. Methods: Among 26,908 Mayo Clinic patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1972 and 2017, 3,799 patients had information on BMI within 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the differences in overall survival between BMI groups in each cancer stage, controlling for age, gender, year of diagnosis, and cancer location. The impact of change of BMI at 30, 60, and 90 days on survival afterwards were also analyzed. Results: Among 3,799 patients included in the study, there were 29% normal weight, 2% underweight, 36% overweight, and 33% obese patients. With all stages combined together, the overall 5-years survival rates for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients were 33, 56, 60, and 65%, respectively (p < 0.001). The results show that, the difference in overall survival was not statistically significant when underweight, overweight, and obese patients were compared to normal weight patients in stage 1 and stage 2, although there was a trend that overweight patients had better survival than normal weight group in stage 2 cancer patients (HR = 0.8, p = 0.086). In stage 3 and 4 patients combined, underweight group demonstrated a significant disadvantage (HR = 1.96, p = 0.007) for overall survival compared to the normal weight group. Additionally, post-diagnosis BMI drop more than 10% from either a previous time (HR = 1.88, p = 0.002) or pre-diagnosis time (HR = 1.61, p < 0.001) was associated with worse overall survival after adjusting for baseline variables. Conclusions: BMI is an important consideration in patients with colorectal cancer. Outcomes are stage-dependent where in some situations obesity maybe an advantage. More importantly, being underweight is a significant negative predictor of outcome. The impact of drop in BMI or weight, on survival of CRC patients, needs to be studied further since this is potentially an actionable variable and a dynamic biomarker that may help improve outcome in these patients.

AB OBJECTIVES: Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is often considered a low-hanging fruit for genomics-electronic health record (EHR) integrations, and many have expressed the notion that drug-gene interaction checking might one day become as much a commodity in EHRs as drug-drug and drug-allergy checking. In addition, the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator has recognized the trend toward storing complete sequencing data outside the EHR in a Genomic Archiving and Communication System (GACS) and has emphasized the need for "pilots that test Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics for GACS integration with EHRs." We sought to develop a PGx clinical decision support (CDS) service, leveraging the emerging FHIR and CDS Hooks standards, and based on an assumption that pharmacogene sequencing data would be stored alongside the EHR in a GACS.; METHODS: We developed a PGx CDS service as a functional prototype. The service is triggered by a medication order in the EHR. When evoked, the service looks for relevant genetic data in a GACS and returns corresponding recommendations back to the ordering clinician. Where the patient has no genetic data on file, the service can recommend pretreatment genetic testing where applicable.; RESULTS: Overall, we were able to meet our objectives and deploy a functional prototype, interfaced with a commercial EHR. We identified several areas where FHIR or CDS Hooks lacked necessary semantics or have implementation ambiguity. Primary FHIR challenges included multiple ways to say the same thing, which exacerbated the complexity of variant to allele conversion and lack of representation of deoxyribonucleic acid region(s) studied. Primary CDS Hooks challenges included the complexity of executing an authenticated query against one system (GACS) upon being triggered by a different system (the EHR), and limitations in the types of actionable recommendations that can be returned to the EHR.; CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have found that PGx CDS based on FHIR and CDS Hooks appears to represent a promising means of genomics-EHR integration. More real-world testing along with a set of use-case driven GACS interface requirements will push us closer to the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute vision of a plug-in PGx app. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB Metastatic chromophobe renal cell cancer (chRCC) is a rare subtype of RCC with no standard treatment. We performed molecular profiling of 12 chRCC cases to identify alterations predictive of response to therapy. Tests included immunohistochemistry assays, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and next-generation sequencing. Analysis identified c-KIT overexpression in 6/9 (67%) samples analyzed, and loss of protein expression of RRM1 and MGMT in 11/12 (92%) and of PTEN in 7/12 samples (58%). Mutations of TP53, PTEN, APC, and VHL genes were identified. In summary, molecular profiling of chRCC identified alterations in genes and protein expression that might provide a mechanistic rationale for off-label use of approved therapies in advanced chRCC, and could guide the design of molecularly targeted clinical trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we evaluated samples of a rare type of kidney cancer (chromophobe type) and identified potential genetic markers that could be used to individualize treatment and possibly improve treatment outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Nowadays, trendy research in biomedical sciences juxtaposes the term 'precision' to medicine and public health with companion words like big data, data science, and deep learning. Technological advancements permit the collection and merging of large heterogeneous datasets from different sources, from genome sequences to social media posts or from electronic health records to wearables. Additionally, complex algorithms supported by high-performance computing allow one to transform these large datasets into knowledge. Despite such progress, many barriers still exist against achieving precision medicine and precision public health interventions for the benefit of the individual and the population.; MAIN BODY: The present work focuses on analyzing both the technical and societal hurdles related to the development of prediction models of health risks, diagnoses and outcomes from integrated biomedical databases. Methodological challenges that need to be addressed include improving semantics of study designs: medical record data are inherently biased, and even the most advanced deep learning's denoising autoencoders cannot overcome the bias if not handled a priori by design. Societal challenges to face include evaluation of ethically actionable risk factors at the individual and population level; for instance, usage of gender, race, or ethnicity as risk modifiers, not as biological variables, could be replaced by modifiable environmental proxies such as lifestyle and dietary habits, household income, or access to educational resources.; CONCLUSIONS: Data science for precision medicine and public health warrants an informatics-oriented formalization of the study design and interoperability throughout all levels of the knowledge inference process, from the research semantics, to model development, and ultimately to implementation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Describe research methods used in priority-setting exercises for musculoskeletal conditions and synthesise the priorities identified.; DESIGN: Scoping review.; SETTING AND POPULATION: Studies that elicited the research priorities of patients/consumers, clinicians, researchers, policy-makers and/or funders for any musculoskeletal condition were included.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to November 2017 and the James Lind Alliance top 10 priorities, Cochrane Priority Setting Methods Group, and Cochrane Musculoskeletal and Back Groups review priority lists. The reported methods and research topics/questions identified were extracted, and a descriptive synthesis conducted.; RESULTS: Forty-nine articles fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Methodologies and stakeholders varied widely (26 included a mix of clinicians, consumers and others, 16 included only clinicians, 6 included only consumers or patients and in 1 participants were unclear). Only two (4%) reported any explicit inclusion criteria for priorities. We identified 294 broad research priorities from 37 articles and 246 specific research questions from 17 articles, although only four (24%) of the latter listed questions in an actionable format. Research priorities for osteoarthritis were identified most often (n=7), followed by rheumatoid arthritis (n=4), osteoporosis (n=4) and back pain (n=4). Nearly half of both broad and specific research priorities were focused on treatment interventions (n=116and 111, respectively), while few were economic (n=8, 2.7% broad and n=1, 0.4% specific), implementation (n=6, 2% broad and n=4, 1.6% specific) or health services and systems research (n=15, 5.1% broad and n=9, 3.7% specific) priorities.; CONCLUSIONS: While many research priority-setting studies in the musculoskeletal field have been performed, methodological limitations and lack of actionable research questions limit their usefulness. Future studies should ensure they conform to good priority-setting practice to ensure that the generated priorities are of maximum value.; PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017059250. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

AB Recent genetic studies and whole-genome sequencing projects have greatly improved our understanding of human variation and clinically actionable genetic information. Smaller ethnic populations, however, remain underrepresented in both individual and large-scale sequencing efforts and hence present an opportunity to discover new variants of biomedical and demographic significance. This report describes the sequencing and analysis of a genome obtained from an individual of Serbian origin, introducing tens of thousands of previously unknown variants to the currently available pool. Ancestry analysis places this individual in close proximity to Central and Eastern European populations; i.e., closest to Croatian, Bulgarian and Hungarian individuals and, in terms of other Europeans, furthest from Ashkenazi Jewish, Spanish, Sicilian and Baltic individuals. Our analysis confirmed gene flow between Neanderthal and ancestral pan-European populations, with similar contributions to the Serbian genome as those observed in other European groups. Finally, to assess the burden of potentially disease-causing/clinically relevant variation in the sequenced genome, we utilized manually curated genotype-phenotype association databases and variant-effect predictors. We identified several variants that have previously been associated with severe early-onset disease that is not evident in the proband, as well as putatively impactful variants that could yet prove to be clinically relevant to the proband over the next decades. The presence of numerous private and low-frequency variants, along with the observed and predicted disease-causing mutations in this genome, exemplify some of the global challenges of genome interpretation, especially in the context of under-studied ethnic groups.

AB AIM: To develop a process for returning medically actionable genomic variants to Latino patients receiving care in a Federally Qualified Health Center.; METHODS: Prior to recruitment, researchers met with primary care providers to (1) orient clinicians to the project, (2) establish a process for returning actionable and nonactionable results to participants and providers through the electronic health record, and (3) develop a process for offering clinical decision support for follow-up education and care. A Community Advisory Board was engaged to provide input on recruitment strategies and materials for conveying results to participants. Participants in the Sangre Por Salud (Blood for Health) Biobank with hyperlipidemia or colon polyps represented the pool of potentially eligible participants.; RESULTS: A total of 1,621 individuals were invited to participate and 710 agreed to an in- person consenting visit (194 no-showed and 16 declined). Over 12-months, 500 participants were enrolled. Participants were primarily Spanish-speaking (81.6%), female (74.2%), and enrolled because of hyperlipidemia (95.4%). All but 2 participants opted to receive primary (i.e., related to enrollment phenotypes) as well as secondary actionable results.; CONCLUSION: Efforts to bring precision medicine to community-based health centers serving minority patients may require multilevel engagement activities to include individuals, providers, health systems, and the community. © 2018 S.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the McMaster Family Health Team (MFHT) as part of a Continuous Quality Improvement initiative using a set of provincial performance metrics to demonstrate which measures of assessment are actually clinically meaningful in context and where system-level changes might be implemented to improve operational practice.; Methods: Measures were selected from the Primary Care Performance Measurement Framework based on data availability for the MFHT and provincial comparators. The measures explored in this paper are those that were deemed to have actionable properties. Data were extracted from billing reports, electronic medical records and information collated for the Association of Family Health Teams of Ontario Data to Decisions database. Metrics were then examined to demonstrate the importance of interpretation in clinical context.; Conclusions: Quantitative assessment of performance based on standardised measures is a suitable starting point when evaluating a practice, however it is not appropriate as a stand-alone report card of practice performance. Rather, quantitative measures must be of clinical relevance and applicable to the patient populations of interest in order to create conversation and impact change. Thus, the focus of quality improvement should not be to improve numbers relating to efficiency, patient satisfaction and continuity of care, but rather to determine what drives those numbers and how changes might be made at a system or practice level that will optimise clinician buy-in.

AB For 35 years options for treating advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) were limited to doxorubicin, dacarbazine and ifosfamide. In 2007, trabectedin was approved. Since then, several other agents have become available and many more are in development, ushering in a new era in disease management. Considerable scope exists for improving outcomes of advanced STS through better trial design and improved patient care in everyday practice. After anthracycline failure, there are a range of treatment options and, increasingly, the choice of therapy is histology driven. Introduction of newer agents and optimising use of established agents such as trabectedin has led to an increase in overall survival of advanced STS patients. Optimising treatment with trabectedin is being achieved through more extensive experience in drug management, mainly associated with use in earlier lines and uninterrupted use until disease progression. Identification by next-generation sequencing of a significant proportion of cases of actionable mutations among patients with advanced STS suggests a move towards matched therapy in future. As the armamentarium of active agents in advanced sarcoma increases, so too will the challenge of selecting the right drug for the right patient at the right time, in accordance with the patient's lifestyle and wishes. © 2018 S.

AB BACKGROUND: In the US, emergency room visits and overdoses related to prescription opioids have soared and the rates of illicit opioid use, including heroin and fentanyl, are increasing. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, higher HIV and HCV infection rates, and criminal behavior. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT; methadone and buprenorphine) is proven to be effective in treating OUD and decreasing its negative consequences. While the efficacy of OAT has been established, too few providers prescribe OAT to patients with OUD due to patient, provider, or system factors. While the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made great strides in OAT implementation, national treatment rates remain low (35% of patients with OUD) and several facilities continue to have much lower prescribing rates.; METHODS: Eight VA sites with low baseline prescribing rates (lowest quartile,<21%) were randomly selected from the 35 low prescribing sites to receive an intensive external facilitation implementation intervention to increase OAT prescribing rates. The intervention includes a site-specific developmental evaluation, a kick-off site visit, and 12months of ongoing facilitation. The developmental evaluation includes qualitative interviews with patients, substance use disorders clinic staff, and primary care and general mental health leadership to assess site-level barriers. The site visit includes: (1) a review of site-specific barriers and potential implementation strategies; (2) instruction on using available dashboards to track prescribing rates and identify actionable patients; and (3) education on OAT, including, if requested, buprenorphine certification training for prescribers. On-going facilitation consists of monthly conference calls with individual site teams and expert clinical consultation. The primary outcomes is the proportion of Veterans with OUD initiating and sustaining OAT, with intervention sites expected to have larger increases in prescribing compared to control sites. Final qualitative interviews and a cost assessment will inform future implementation efforts.; DISCUSSION: This project will examine and respond to barriers encountered in low prescribing VHA clinics allowing refinement of an intervention to enhance access to medication treatment for OUD in additional facilities.

AB BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies have long become prominent components of health systems. Rapid advances in digital technologies and data science over the last few years are predicted to have a vast impact on health care services, configuring a paradigm shift into what is now commonly referred to as digital health. Forecasted to curb rising health costs as well as to improve health system efficiency and safety, digital health success heavily relies on trust from professional end users, administrators, and patients. Yet, what counts as the building blocks of trust in digital health systems has so far remained underexplored.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze what relevant stakeholders consider as enablers and impediments of trust in digital health.; METHODS: We performed a scoping review to map out trust in digital health. To identify relevant digital health studies, we searched 5 electronic databases. Using keywords and Medical Subject Headings, we targeted all relevant studies and set no boundaries for publication year to allow a broad range of studies to be identified. The studies were screened by 2 reviewers after which a predefined data extraction strategy was employed and relevant themes documented.; RESULTS: Overall, 278 qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, and intervention studies in English, published between 1998 and 2017 and conducted in 40 countries were included in this review. Patients and health care professionals were the two most prominent stakeholders of trust in digital health; a third-health administrators-was substantially less prominent. Our analysis identified cross-cutting personal, institutional, and technological elements of trust that broadly cluster into 16 enablers (altruism, fair data access, ease of use, self-efficacy, sociodemographic factors, recommendation by other users, usefulness, customizable design features, interoperability, privacy, initial face-to-face contact, guidelines for standardized use, stakeholder engagement, improved communication, decreased workloads, and service provider reputation) and 10 impediments (excessive costs, limited accessibility, sociodemographic factors, fear of data exploitation, insufficient training, defective technology, poor information quality, inadequate publicity, time-consuming, and service provider reputation) to trust in digital health.; CONCLUSIONS: Trust in digital health technologies and services depends on the interplay of a complex set of enablers and impediments. This study is a contribution to ongoing efforts to understand what determines trust in digital health according to different stakeholders. Therefore, it offers valuable points of reference for the implementation of innovative digital health services. Building on insights from this study, actionable metrics can be developed to assess the trustworthiness of digital technologies in health care. ©Afua Adjekum, Alessandro Blasimme, Effy Vayena.

AB BACKGROUND: In order to establish the workflows required to implement a real-time process involving multi-omic analysis of patient samples to support precision-guided therapeutic intervention, a tissue acquisition and analysis trial was implemented. This report describes our findings to date, including the frequency with which mutational testing led to precision-guided therapy and outcome for those patients.; METHODS: Eligible patients presenting to Oregon Health and Science University Knight Cancer Institute were enrolled on the study. Patients with biopsy proven metastatic or locally advanced unresectable prostate cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia receiving standard of care therapy were eligible. Metastatic site biopsies were collected and analyzed using the Knight Diagnostic Lab GeneTrails comprehensive solid tumor panel (124 genes). CLIA certified genomic information was made available to the treating physician.; RESULTS: Between 1/26/2017 and 5/30/2018, 38 patients were enrolled, with 28 successfully undergoing biopsy. Of these, 25 samples yielded sufficient tumor for analysis. The median biopsy cellularity and number of cores collected were 70% (15-90%) and 5 (2-20), respectively. No procedure-related complications occurred. GeneTrails analysis revealed that 22 of 25 (88%) tumor samples harbored at least one potentially actionable mutation, and 18 (72%) samples harbored 2 or more potentially actionable mutations. The most common genetic alterations identified involved: DNA damage repair genes, cell cycle regulating genes, PIK3CA/Akt/mTOR pathway, and FGF gene family. To date, CLIA certified genomic results were used by treating physicians for precision-guided therapy in 5 (23%) patients.; CONCLUSION: We report the feasibility of real-time tissue acquisition and analysis to support a successful translational oncology platform. The workflow will provide the foundation to improve access and accrual to biomarker driven precision oncology trials.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Soft-tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of diseases accounting for up to 1% of cancer in adults and 15% of cancer in children. Introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has allowed to gain additional insight into the genetic diversity and complexity of sarcomas, including the potential therapeutic implications of some genetic alterations.Two large studies have investigated the role of targeted NGS to identify actionable mutations in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. In these two studies, actionable alterations were identified in up to 50% of patients. Retrospective data suggest that genomically guided treatments may be associated with substantial clinical benefit in sarcoma patients with advanced disease. However, prospective data are lacking. The MULTISARC is a randomized phase 3 investigating the potential of NGS implementation to improve outcome of metastatic sarcoma patients.Overall, a significant proportion of soft-tissue sarcoma bears potential targetable genomic alteration that can be identified through NGS. There is still a lack of evidence to support routine implementation of NGS for the management of sarcoma patient. The MULTISARC randomized trial which randomized patients to tumor genetic profiling or not might confirm the role of NGS to improve outcome of metastatic sarcoma patients through the identification of additional genomically guided lines of treatment.

AB Therapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is currently determined by histologic subtype and the presence or absence of actionable mutations. Accurate subclassification is therefore essential for appropriate selection of cases for molecular studies and guiding treatment. The gold standard for subclassification of NSCLC is identification of differentiating morphologic features in correlation with diagnostic immunohistochemistry (IHC) in cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma. Whereas Napsin A, TTF1, and p40 antibodies have been used individually for the subtyping of NSCLC, few studies have examined the 3 in cocktail form. Using a novel triple IHC antibody cocktail (TNP) composed of TTF1 (brown nuclear), Napsin A (red granular cytoplasmic), and p40 (red nuclear), a randomized, double-blinded subclassification was performed on a representative histologic section of 32 previously resected primary NSCLCs. TNP results were then compared with the gold-standard diagnosis. TNP accurately identified all (100%, 10/10) squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (p40+/TTF1-/Napsin A-) and 89% (16/18) of adenocarcinomas (ADCs) (p40-/TTF1+/Napsin A+). TNP was negative in 7 (20%) tumors (p40-/TTF1-/Napsin A-), including 2 mucinous ADCs. TNP showed no overlapping or discordant immunostaining. Using traditional IHC with p63, CK5/6, and TTF1, all TNP (-) cases remained unclassifiable. With the exception of mucinous ADC, which was TNP negative, all TNP cases correlated with gold-standard diagnosis; 78% of tumors were also definitively classified as either ADC or SCC and required only a single slide for classification.

AB An outsized proportion of asthma-related morbidity and mortality is borne by the 5%to 15%of affected patients who have severe forms of the disease. These patients experience poorly controlled symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite daily treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and other long-acting controller medications. Ongoing research has elucidated key pathophysiologic processes and other clinical parameters related to asthma severity and persistence. In many cases, the patient's medical history, clinical presentation, and results from biomarker testing can help classify severe asthma phenotypically. Increasingly, this approach can allow health-care providers to personalize maintenance regimens using targeted therapies for the identified endotypes; that is, asthma phenotypes linked to specific underlying disease mechanisms and proinflammatory signaling cascades. Several biologic medications are now available to treat certain cohorts with severe asthma, and a number of other targeted agents are in late-stage development. Pulmonologists and asthma specialists who manage patients with severe asthma need to stay current on the latest published trial data for newer targeted therapies, approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration, and actionable best-practice recommendations on evaluating and treating patients with severe asthma. During this web-based Clinical Issues program (available online at https://courses.elseviercme.com/asthma18/761e), a panel of expert faculty discuss a series of topics related to the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of severe asthma, including the following: characterizing severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes; identification of patients with severe asthma; and the role of biomarkers in asthma phenotyping. The faculty also highlight the identification and management of comorbid conditions commonly associated with asthma. An overview of new and emerging biologic therapies for severe asthma is provided, followed by a detailed discussion on personalizing treatment for patients with severe asthma. Copyright © 2018.

AB BACKGROUND: Prior work to integrate early palliative care in oncology has focused on patients with advanced cancer and primarily on palliative care consultation. We developed this outpatient clinic initiative for newly diagnosed patients at any stage, emphasizing primary (nonspecialist) palliative care by oncology teams, with enhanced access to palliative care specialists.; METHODS: We piloted the project in two medical oncology specialty clinics (for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and GI cancer, respectively) to establish feasibility. On a visit-based schedule, patients systematically reported symptoms, information/decision-making preferences, and illness understanding. They also participated in discussions of their core values with their oncology nurse. Oncology teams were first responders to palliative care needs, whereas specialists were available for clinician support and direct patient consultation.; RESULTS: All 58 eligible patients were enrolled. In both clinics, patient self-reports documented a heavy symptom burden. Information/decision-making preferences and illness understanding levels varied across patients. Patients prepared new advance directives. Oncology nurses documented discussions of core values. Requests for palliative care consultation decreased over time as oncology teams embraced their primary palliative care role with coaching from the specialists. Clinic workflow and patient volume were maintained.; CONCLUSION: Our pilot experience suggests that in outpatient oncology clinics, a structured, scheduled, and systematic approach is feasible to deliver palliative care to newly diagnosed patients with cancer at any stage and throughout their illness trajectory. This novel approach identified important, actionable palliative care needs, relying primarily on oncology teams to respond to these needs, while enhancing access to palliative care specialist input. Expansion to additional clinics will allow evaluation of scalability and generalizability, along with measurement of a broader range of important outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Mobile phone applications (apps) offer motivation and support for self-management of diabetes mellitus (DM), but their use is limited by high attrition due to insufficient consideration of end-users perspectives and usability requirements. This study aimed to examine app usage and feature preferences among people with DM, and explore their recommendations for future inclusions to foster engagement with diabetes apps.; METHODS: The study was conducted internationally on adults with type 1 or type 2 DM using online questionnaire (quantitative) to investigate usage and preferences for app features that support diabetes self-management and semi structured telephone interview (qualitative) to explore suggestions on fostering engagement and specific educational information for inclusion into diabetes apps. Survey and interview data were analysed using descriptive/ inferential statistics and inductive thematic analysis respectively.; RESULTS: A total of 217 respondents with type 1 DM (38.25%) or type 2 DM (61.8%), from 4 continents (Australia, Europe, Asia and America) participated in the survey. About half of the respondents (48%) use apps, mainly with features for tracking blood glucose (56.6%), blood pressure (51.9%) and food calories (48.1%). Preferred features in future apps include nutrient values of foods (56.7%), blood glucose (54.8%), physical exercise tracker (47%), health data analytics (42.9%) and education on diabetes self-management (40.6%). Irrespective of the type of DM, participants proposed future apps that are user friendly, support healthy eating, provide actionable reminders and consolidate data across peripheral health devices. Participants with type 1 DM recommended customised features with news update on developments in the field of diabetes. Nominated specific educational topics included tips on problem solving, use of insulin pump therapy, signs of diabetes complication and transitioning from paediatric into adult care.; CONCLUSIONS: The study has highlighted patients' perspectives on essential components for inclusion in diabetes apps to promote engagement and foster better health outcomes.

AB Purpose: To address the high unmet need for postpartum family planning (PPFP) in resource-limited settings, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, this study aimed to identify PPFP-related barriers and catalysts to inform policies and programs to increase access to postpartum contraception.; Methods: Using qualitative methodology, we explored the perspectives of women, adolescent girls, men, religious and community leaders, service providers, and decision makers from three rural communities in Burkina Faso and three rural-urban communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Both countries have high unmet need for PPFP and are priority countries of the French Muskoka Fund for Maternal and Child Health.; Results: Perceived catalysts included negative traditional views on the consequences borne by closely spaced children and their mothers; a 6-week postpartum visit dedicated to PPFP (albeit poorly attended); political will and enabling policies for FP; and support from certain religious leaders and men. Main reported barriers were the lack of male engagement; out-of-pocket copayment for contraceptives; reliance on amenorrhea for pregnancy prevention without knowing its limits; misconceptions about modern contraceptives, including prerequisites for the lactational amenorrhea method; sexual abstinence supported by religious and traditional norms for up to 3-6 months, although women reported earlier resumption of sexual activity; low prioritization of scheduled postpartum visits by women; and limited availability of readily accessible methods, PPFP counseling materials, and clinic days and scheduled visits dedicated to contraceptive services.; Conclusion: Based on results found to be most actionable, the following interventions have the potential to optimize access to PPFP services: counseling women on postpartum-pregnancy risks and options at different points in time before and after childbirth through the use of appropriate information, education, and counseling materials; integrating PPFP services into existing maternal and child health visits; making contraceptives readily available and affordable; and meaningfully engaging male partners.

AB Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) represent ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy, but few have been identified thus far. We therefore developed a proteogenomic approach to enable the high-throughput discovery of TSAs coded by potentially all genomic regions. In two murine cancer cell lines and seven human primary tumors, we identified a total of 40 TSAs, about 90% of which derived from allegedly noncoding regions and would have been missed by standard exome-based approaches. Moreover, most of these TSAs derived from nonmutated yet aberrantly expressed transcripts (such as endogenous retroelements) that could be shared by multiple tumor types. Last, we demonstrated that, in mice, the strength of antitumor responses after TSA vaccination was influenced by two parameters that can be estimated in humans and could serve for TSA prioritization in clinical studies: TSA expression and the frequency of TSA-responsive T cells in the preimmune repertoire. In conclusion, the strategy reported herein could considerably facilitate the identification and prioritization of actionable human TSAs.

AB BACKGROUND: A major challenge for effective pharmacotherapy in pain management is to provide the drug best suited to the patient's innate characteristics.; OBJECTIVE: The article illustrates pharmacogenetic principles to optimize treatments for patients and increase the likelihood of pain relief without dependence. Genetic variances are particularly relevant to opioid drugs used in pain control, and can now be harvested for predictive clinical decision support.; STUDY DESIGN: Clinically actionable polymorphisms in CYP2D6 (cytochrome p450 2D6) and OPRM1 (mu 1 opioid receptor), the most important gene coding, respectively, for a metabolizing enzyme and receptor for opioids are reviewed, and functional effects described.; METHODS: Risk of dysfunction is calculated from the frequency of the alleles with null function for CYP2D6, and from the low function polymorphism for OPRM1. Integration of genetic variability was performed for 9 combinatorial scenarios for CYP2D6 and OPRM1. Each combination was quantified in frequency and classified for clinical impact. A rational and pharmacological basis for personalized pain management based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling is extracted from the frequency of the combinations.; RESULTS: Patients can be classified in 3 broad risk categories for opioid side effects and dependence. Patients at high-risk with dysfunctional CYP2D6 or OPRM1 account for ~14% of the population and are best managed with non-opioids. Patients at medium risk with subnormal CYP2D6 or OPRM1 account for ~48% of the population and can be managed with dose monitoring. Patients at low risk with functional CYP2D6 and OPRM1 account for ~38% of the population and should be availed to opioid therapy.; LIMITATIONS: Heuristic clinical decision support considerations are not validated yet by deployment in large clinical practices. Environmental modifiers such as other drugs and dietary supplements interact with innate characteristics to modify the genetic predictions.; CONCLUSION: Through clinical decision support interpreting the genotyping data, drug choices and doses can then be tailored to provide safe and effective therapy for individual patients. This precision affords personalized medicine to be practiced in pain treatment. Genetic factors could help determine why some patients seem more vulnerable than others to opioid side effects and dependence.; KEY WORDS: Pain management, opioids, CYP2D6, OPRM1, clinical decision support, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenetics, combinatorial genotypes.

AB INTRODUCTION: Extensive antibiotic use makes the intensive care unit (ICU) an important focus for antibiotic stewardship programs. The aim of this study was to develop a set of actionable quality indicators for appropriate antibiotic use at ICUs and an implementation toolbox, which can be used to assess and improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use in the treatment of adult patients at an ICU.; METHODS: A four round modified-RAND Delphi procedure was used. Potential indicators were identified by a multidisciplinary panel of 15 Dutch experts, from international literature and guidelines. Using an online survey, the identified indicators were rated on three criteria: relevance, actionability and feasibility. Experts discussed and rated the indicators for the second time during a face-to-face consensus meeting. During a final consensus meeting the toolbox was developed, containing potential barriers and improvement strategies which were identified using a validated checklist by Flottorp et al., and if available also containing supporting material.; RESULTS: The first round resulted in 24 potential indicators. After the final meeting a set of three process indicators, one structure indicator and one quantity metric remained: 1) perform at least two sets of blood cultures before start of empirical systemic therapy; 2) perform therapeutic drug monitoring in patients treated with vancomycin or aminoglycosides; 3) perform surveillance cultures if selective digestive or oropharyngeal decontamination is applied at the ICU; 4) biannual face-to-face meetings between ICU and microbiology staff in which local resistance rates are discussed; and 5) quantitative antibiotic use at the ICU expressed in days of therapy (DOT). The toolbox contains 24 unique barriers and 37 improvement strategies.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a set of four actionable quality indicators and one quantity metric, together with an implementation toolbox, to improve appropriate antibiotic use at ICUs.

AB Exome sequencing is increasingly utilized in both clinical and nonclinical settings, but little is known about its utility in healthy individuals. Most previous studies on this topic have examined a small subset of genes known to be implicated in human disease and/or have used automated pipelines to assess pathogenicity of known variants. To determine the frequency of both medically actionable and nonactionable but medically relevant exome findings in the general population we assessed the exomes of 70 participants who have been extensively characterized over the past several years as part of a longitudinal integrated multiomics profiling study. We analyzed exomes by identifying rare likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants in genes associated with Mendelian disease in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. We then used American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines for the classification of rare sequence variants. Additionally, we assessed pharmacogenetic variants. Twelve out of 70 (17%) participants had medically actionable findings in Mendelian disease genes. Five had phenotypes or family histories associated with their genetic variants. The frequency of actionable variants is higher than that reported in most previous studies and suggests added benefit from utilizing expanded gene lists and manual curation to assess actionable findings. A total of 63 participants (90%) had additional nonactionable findings, including 60 who were found to be carriers for recessive diseases and 21 who have increased Alzheimer's disease risk because of heterozygous or homozygous APOE e4 alleles (18 participants had both). Our results suggest that exome sequencing may have considerably more utility for health management in the general population than previously thought. © 2018 Rego et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB BACKGROUND: In melanoma, like in other cancers, both genetic alterations and epigenetic underlie the metastatic process. These effects are usually measured by changes in both methylome and transcriptome profiles, whose cross-correlation remains uncertain. We aimed to assess at systems scale the significance of epigenetic treatment in melanoma cells with different metastatic potential.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: Treatment by DAC demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine of two melanoma cell lines endowed with different metastatic potential, SKMEL-2 and HS294T, was performed and high-throughput coupled RNA-Seq and RRBS-Seq experiments delivered differential profiles (DiP) of both transcriptomes and methylomes. Methylation levels measured at both TSS and gene body were studied to inspect correlated patterns with wide-spectrum transcript abundance levels quantified in both protein coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regions. The DiP were then mapped onto standard bio-annotation sources (pathways, biological processes) and network configurations were obtained. The prioritized associations for target identification purposes were expected to elucidate the reprogramming dynamics induced by the epigenetic therapy. The interactomic connectivity maps of each cell line were formed to support the analysis of epigenetically re-activated genes. i.e. those supposedly silenced by melanoma. In particular, modular protein interaction networks (PIN) were used, evidencing a limited number of shared annotations, with an example being MAPK13 (cascade of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli). This gene is also a target associated to the PANDAR ncRNA, therapeutically relevant because of its aberrant expression observed in various cancers. Overall, the non-metastatic SKMEL-2 map reveals post-treatment re-activation of a richer pathway landscape, involving cadherins and integrins as signatures of cell adhesion and proliferation. Relatively more lncRNAs were also annotated, indicating more complex regulation patterns in view of target identification. Finally, the antigen maps matched to DiP display other differential signatures with respect to the metastatic potential of the cell lines. In particular, as demethylated melanomas show connected targets that grow with the increased metastatic potential, also the potential target actionability seems to depend to some degree on the metastatic state. However, caution is required when assessing the direct influence of re-activated genes over the identified targets. In light of the stronger treatment effects observed in non-metastatic conditions, some limitations likely refer to in silico data integration tools and resources available for the analysis of tumor antigens.; CONCLUSION: Demethylation treatment strongly affects early melanoma progression by re-activating many genes. This evidence suggests that the efficacy of this type of therapeutic intervention is potentially high at the pre-metastatic stages. The biomarkers that can be assessed through antigens seem informative depending on the metastatic conditions, and networks help to elucidate the assessment of possible targets actionability.

AB BACKGROUND: The objective of the review was to synthesize evidence of barriers and facilitators to the integration of mental health services into PHC from existing literature. The structure of the review was guided by the SPIDER framework which involves the following: Sample or population of interest-primary care providers (PCPs); Phenomenon of Interest-integration of mental health services into primary health care (PHC); Design-influenced robustness and analysis of the study; Evaluation-outcomes included subjective outcomes (views and attitudes); and Research type-qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies.; METHODS: Studies that described mental health integration in PHC settings, involved primary care providers, and presented barriers/facilitators of mental health integration into PHC were included in the review. The sources of information included PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, the WHO website, and OpenGrey. Assessment of bias and quality was done using two separate tools: the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) qualitative checklist and the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.; RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria out of the 3353 search results. The most frequently reported barriers to integration of mental health services into PHC were (i) attitudes regarding program acceptability, appropriateness, and credibility; (ii) knowledge and skills; (iii) motivation to change; (iv) management and/or leadership; and (v) financial resources. In order to come up with an actionable approach to addressing the barriers, these factors were further analyzed along a behavior change theory.; DISCUSSION: We have shown that the integration of mental health services into PHC has been carried out by various countries. The analysis from this review provides evidence to inform policy on the existing barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the mental health integration policy option.

AB There is a critical need to develop supports for older adults who have a wide range of abilities, including those aging with long-term impairments. Without appropriate support, many individuals will be functioning below optimal levels and will face participation barriers. Technology holds great promise to provide individualized support for a wide range of abilities and for a variety of domains. To ensure technology interventions are designed well and meet research-documented user requirements, we need more specific, actionable models to provide guidance for those developing and designing interventions. In this paper, we present the TechSAge Aging and Disability Model to bridge models from the aging and disability literatures and to disambiguate the population of individuals aging into disability from those aging with disability (i.e., pre-existing impairments). We also present the TechSAge Technology Intervention Model to support aging with pre-existing impairments, which provides direction and touch points for technology interventions. These models reflect the complex and dynamic interaction between age-related changes and an individual's prior capabilities and limitations. We describe the need for these models with respect to filling a gap in the disability and aging literature by highlighting the importance of differentiating between age-related changes and long-term impairments when designing interventions. We also show the need for quantitative and qualitative data to refine the models given complexities of the current state of the literature and survey data. The TechSAge Technology Intervention Model can be used to drive and inform technology redesign and development.

AB BACKGROUND: Pythia is an automated, clinically curated surgical data pipeline and repository housing all surgical patient electronic health record (EHR) data from a large, quaternary, multisite health institute for data science initiatives. In an effort to better identify high-risk surgical patients from complex data, a machine learning project trained on Pythia was built to predict postoperative complication risk.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: A curated data repository of surgical outcomes was created using automated SQL and R code that extracted and processed patient clinical and surgical data across 37 million clinical encounters from the EHRs. A total of 194 clinical features including patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, race), smoking status, medications, comorbidities, procedure information, and proxies for surgical complexity were constructed and aggregated. A cohort of 66,370 patients that had undergone 99,755 invasive procedural encounters between January 1, 2014, and January 31, 2017, was studied further for the purpose of predicting postoperative complications. The average complication and 30-day postoperative mortality rates of this cohort were 16.0% and 0.51%, respectively. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) penalized logistic regression, random forest models, and extreme gradient boosted decision trees were trained on this surgical cohort with cross-validation on 14 specific postoperative outcome groupings. Resulting models had area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values ranging between 0.747 and 0.924, calculated on an out-of-sample test set from the last 5 months of data. Lasso penalized regression was identified as a high-performing model, providing clinically interpretable actionable insights. Highest and lowest performing lasso models predicted postoperative shock and genitourinary outcomes with AUCs of 0.924 (95% CI: 0.901, 0.946) and 0.780 (95% CI: 0.752, 0.810), respectively. A calculator requiring input of 9 data fields was created to produce a risk assessment for the 14 groupings of postoperative outcomes. A high-risk threshold (15% risk of any complication) was determined to identify high-risk surgical patients. The model sensitivity was 76%, with a specificity of 76%. Compared to heuristics that identify high-risk patients developed by clinical experts and the ACS NSQIP calculator, this tool performed superiorly, providing an improved approach for clinicians to estimate postoperative risk for patients. Limitations of this study include the missingness of data that were removed for analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: Extracting and curating a large, local institution's EHR data for machine learning purposes resulted in models with strong predictive performance. These models can be used in clinical settings as decision support tools for identification of high-risk patients as well as patient evaluation and care management. Further work is necessary to evaluate the impact of the Pythia risk calculator within the clinical workflow on postoperative outcomes and to optimize this data flow for future machine learning efforts.

AB OA is a multifactorial and progressive disease with no cure yet. Substantial efforts have been made and several biochemical and genetic markers have been reported, but neither alone nor in combination is adequate to identify early OA changes or determine disease progression with sufficient predictive values. Recent advances in metabolomics and its application to the study of OA have led to elucidation of involvement of several metabolic pathways and new specific metabolic markers for OA. Some of these metabolic pathways affect amino acid metabolism, including branched chain amino acids and arginine, and phospholipid metabolism involving conversion of phosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidylcholine. These metabolic markers appear to be clinically actionable and may potentially improve the clinical management of OA patients. In this article, we review the recent studies of metabolomics of OA, discuss those novel metabolic markers and their potential clinical utility, and indicate future research directions in the field.

AB Aging biomarkers are the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the aging processes of the human body. Estimation of biological age is important for assessing the physiological state of an organism. The advent of machine learning lead to the development of the many age predictors commonly referred to as the "aging clocks" varying in biological relevance, ease of use, cost, actionability, interpretability, and applications. Here we present and investigate a novel non-invasive class of visual photographic biomarkers of aging. We developed a simple and accurate predictor of chronological age using just the anonymized images of eye corners called the PhotoAgeClock. Deep neural networks were trained on 8414 anonymized high-resolution images of eye corners labeled with the correct chronological age. For people within the age range of 20 to 80 in a specific population, the model was able to achieve a mean absolute error of 2.3 years and 95% Pearson and Spearman correlation.

AB Background: KRAS genotyping in tumor samples is a decisive clinical test for the anti-EGFR therapy management. However, the complexity of KRAS mutation landscape across different cancer types and the mosaic effect caused by cancer cellularity and heterogeneity make the choice of KRAS genotyping method a challenging topic in the clinical practice.; Methods: We depicted the landscape of somatic KRAS mutation in 7,844 primary tumors and 10,336 metastatic tumors across over 30 types of cancer using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSKCC-IMPACT) databases, respectively. A snapback primer assay based on melting curve analysis was developed to detect the most common somatic mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13. The sensitivity and accuracy of the method was validated by genotyping 100 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, in comparison with Sanger sequencing and T-A cloning sequencing.; Results: Pancreas adenocarcinoma (somatic mutation frequency 90.6%), colorectal adenocarcinoma (42.5%), and lung adenocarcinoma (32.6%) are the top three most KRAS mutant primary cancer types. The metastatic tumors showed a higher prevalence (90.99% versus 66.31%) and diversity of KRAS mutation compared with the primary tumors. Mutations in codons 12 and 13 are the predominant genetic alteration in KRAS (84.15% for TCGA and 86.13% for MSK-IMPACT). Moreover, KRAS mutation is highly correlated with the overall survival of patients with metastatic cancer. The snapback primer assay showed a more favorable performance in enriching and detecting the KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutation (1% mutation load) compared with Sanger sequencing (20% mutation load and 7% false-negative rate).; Conclusions: KRAS mutation pattern is highly diverse among different cancer types and is associated with the survival of patients with metastatic cancers. The snapback primer assay is a reliable, sensitive method to detect the major mutant KRAS alleles, which might facilitate the effective cancer treatment decisions.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular precision oncology is an emerging practice to improve cancer therapy by decreasing the risk of choosing treatments that lack efficacy or cause adverse events. However, the challenges of integrating molecular profiling into routine clinical care are manifold. From a computational perspective these include the importance of a short analysis turnaround time, the interpretation of complex drug-gene and gene-gene interactions, and the necessity of standardized high-quality workflows. In addition, difficulties faced when integrating molecular diagnostics into clinical practice are ethical concerns, legal requirements, and limited availability of treatment options beyond standard of care as well as the overall lack of awareness of their existence.; METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group in Switzerland that established a workflow for personalized diagnostics based on comprehensive high-throughput sequencing of tumors at the clinic. Our workflow, named SwissMTB (Swiss Molecular Tumor Board), links genetic tumor alterations and gene expression to therapeutic options and clinical trial opportunities. The resulting treatment recommendations are summarized in a clinical report and discussed in a molecular tumor board at the clinic to support therapy decisions.; RESULTS: Here we present results from an observational pilot study including 22 late-stage cancer patients. In this study we were able to identify actionable variants and corresponding therapies for 19 patients. Half of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. In two patients we identified resistance-associated variants explaining lack of therapy response. For five out of eleven patients analyzed before treatment the SwissMTB diagnostic influenced treatment decision.; CONCLUSIONS: SwissMTB enables the analysis and clinical interpretation of large numbers of potentially actionable molecular targets. Thus, our workflow paves the way towards a more frequent use of comprehensive molecular diagnostics in Swiss hospitals.

AB BACKGROUND: Data-driven population segmentation analysis utilizes data analytics to divide a heterogeneous population into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare characteristics. It is a promising patient-centric analysis that enables effective integrated healthcare interventions specific for each segment. Although widely applied, there is no systematic review on the clinical application of data-driven population segmentation analysis.; METHODS: We carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science following PRISMA criteria. We included English peer-reviewed articles that applied data-driven population segmentation analysis on empirical health data. We summarized the clinical settings in which segmentation analysis was applied, compared and contrasted strengths, limitations, and practical considerations of different segmentation methods, and assessed the segmentation outcome of all included studies. The studies were assessed by two independent reviewers.; RESULTS: We retrieved 14,514 articles and included 216 articles. Data-driven population segmentation analysis was widely used in different clinical contexts. 163 studies examined the general population while 53 focused on specific population with certain diseases or conditions, including psychological, oncological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions. Variables used for segmentation in the studies are heterogeneous. Most studies (n=170) utilized secondary data in community settings (n=185). The most common segmentation method was latent class/profile/transition/growth analysis (n=96) followed by K-means cluster analysis (n=60) and hierarchical analysis (n=50), each having its advantages, disadvantages, and practical considerations. We also identified key criteria to evaluate a segmentation framework: internal validity, external validity, identifiability/interpretability, substantiality, stability, actionability/accessibility, and parsimony.; CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven population segmentation has been widely applied and holds great potential in managing population health. The evaluations of segmentation outcome require the interplay of data analytics and subject matter expertise. The optimal framework for segmentation requires further research.

AB Background Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are clinical tools that measure patients' goals of care and assess patient-reported physical, mental, and social well-being. Despite their value in advancing patient-centered care, routine use of PROs in stroke management has lagged. As part of the pragmatic COMPASS (Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services) trial, we developed COMPASS-Care Plan (CP), a clinician-facing application that captures and analyzes PROs for stroke and transient ischemic attack patients discharged home and immediately generates individualized electronic CP. In this report, we (1) present our methods for developing and implementing COMPASS-CP PROs, (2) provide examples of CP generated from COMPASS-CP, (3) describe key functional, social, and behavioral determinants of health captured by COMPASS-CP, and (4) report on clinician experience with using COMPASS-CP in routine clinical practice for care planning and engagement of stroke and transient ischemic attack patients discharged home. Methods and Results We report on the first 871 patients enrolled in 20 North Carolina hospitals randomized to the intervention arm of COMPASS between July 2016 and February 2018; these patients completed a COMPASS follow-up visit within 14 days of hospital discharge. We also report user satisfaction results from 56 clinicians who used COMPASS-CP during these visits. COMPASS-CP identified more cognitive and depression deficits than physical deficits. Within 14-day posthospitalization, less than half of patients could list the major risk factors for stroke, 36% did not recognize blood pressure as a stroke risk factor, and 19% of patients were nonadherent with prescribed medications. Three-fourths of clinicians reported that COMPASS-CP identifies important factors impacting patients' recovery that they otherwise may have missed, and two-thirds were highly satisfied with COMPASS-CP. Conclusions The COMPASS-CP application meets an immediate need to incorporate PROs into the clinical workflow to develop patient-centered CP for stroke patients and has high user satisfaction.

AB BACKGROUND: The MyCode Community Health Initiative (MyCode) is returning actionable results from whole exome sequencing. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition characterized by premature cardiovascular disease.; METHODS: We used multiple methods to assess care in 28 MyCode participants who received FH results. Chart reviews were conducted on 23 individuals in the sample and 7 individuals participated semistructured interviews.; RESULTS: Chart reviews for 23 individuals with a Geisinger primary care provider found that 4 individuals (17% of 23) were at LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) goal (of either LDL-C <100 mg/dL for primary prevention and LDL-C <70 mg/dL for secondary prevention) and 17 individuals (74% of 23) were prescribed lipid-lowering therapy before genetic result disclosure. After disclosure of the genetic test result, 5 individuals (22% of 23) met their LDL-C goal and 18 individuals (78% of 23) were prescribed lipid-lowering therapy. Follow-up care about this result was not documented for 4 individuals (17% of 23). Changes to intensity of medication management were made for 8 individuals (47% of 17 individuals previously prescribed lipid-lowering therapy). Interviewed individuals (n=7) were not surprised by their result as all knew they had high cholesterol; however, individuals did not seem to discern FH as a separate condition from their high cholesterol.; CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals receiving genetic diagnosis of FH, >25% had no changes to lipid-lowering therapy, despite not being at LDL-C goal and learning their high cholesterol is related to a genetic condition requiring more aggressive treatment. Individuals and clinicians may have an inadequate understanding of FH as a distinct condition requiring enhanced medical management.

AB Large volumes of physiological data can now be routinely collected using wearable devices, though a key challenge that remains is the conversion of raw data into clinically relevant and actionable information. While power constraints prevent continuous wireless streaming of large amounts of raw data for offline processing, on-board microprocessors have become sufficiently powerful for data reduction to be performed in real time on the wearable device itself, so that only aggregate, clinically interpretable measures need to be transmitted wirelessly. Here, we use the curve-length transform to extract key beat-by-beat information from the raw ECG waveform, and to identify clinically relevant timing and amplitude information. Each beat is parameterized by 12 morphological features that serve as fiducial markers, sufficient to directly reconstruct a scaffold representation of the ECG waveform. At a nominal heart rate of 70 beats/min and a sampling rate of 250 Hz, typical for wearable monitors, this represents approximately an 18-fold compression. Using difference encoding, the compression ratio improves to 21. Our algorithm computes a running exponentially-weighted average of each identified morphological feature. When any feature deviates significantly from its running average, the algorithm retains the raw waveform for five beats preceding and following the anomaly, enabling future review of the raw data. The algorithm automatically located 93.8% of the 3,615 expert-annotated QRS onsets and offsets in the PhysioNet QT-Database to within 20 ms. Similarly, it located 83.5% of all 3,194 P-wave onset and offset annotations to within 32 ms, and 89.0% of all 3,542 T-wave offset annotations within 72 ms.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Meningiomas, the most common primary brain tumor, have historically been managed with surgery and radiation. Traditional chemotherapy has not been effective. Fortunately, recent advances in genetic sequencing have led to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers in meningioma. This article aims to discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of recently discovered genetic alterations in meningiomas.; RECENT FINDINGS: Many of the recently discovered genetic alterations correlate with distinct clinical phenotypes. SMO, AKT and PIK3CA mutations are enriched in the anterior skull base. KLF4 mutations are specific for secretory histology, and BAP1 alterations are common in progressive rhabdoid meningiomas. Alterations in TERT, DMD and BAP1 correlate with poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, the discovery of clinically actionable alterations in a number of genes, including SMO, AKT1 and PIK3CA, has opened up novel potential avenues for therapeutic management of meningiomas. Overexpression of PD-L1 in higher grade meningiomas also provides preclinical support for the investigation of checkpoint blockade.; SUMMARY: The discovery of genetic alterations has improved our understanding of the natural history and classification of meningiomas. Clinical trials with several novel agents targeting driver mutations are currently accruing patients and they can lead to better treatment strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Comprehensive mutational profiling data now available on all major cancers have led to proposals of novel molecular tumor classifications that modify or replace the established organ- and tissue-based tumor typing. The rationale behind such molecular reclassifications is that genetic alterations underlying cancer pathology predict response to therapy and may therefore offer a more precise view on cancer than histology. The use of individual actionable mutations to select cancers for treatment across histotypes is already being tested in the so-called basket trials with variable success rates. Here, we present a computational approach that facilitates the systematic analysis of the histological context dependency of mutational effects by integrating genomic and proteomic tumor profiles across cancers.; METHODS: To determine effects of oncogenic mutations onprotein profiles, we usedtheenergy distance, which comparesthe Euclidean distancesof protein profiles in tumors with an oncogenic mutation (inner distance) to that in tumors without the mutation (outer distance) and performed Monte Carlo simulations for the significance analysis. Finally, the proteins were ranked by their contribution to profile differences to identify proteins characteristic of oncogenic mutation effects across cancers.; RESULTS: We apply our approach to four current proposals of molecular tumor classifications and major therapeutically relevant actionable genes. All 12 actionable genes evaluated show effects on the protein level in the corresponding tumor type and showed additional mutation-related protein profiles in 21 tumor types. Moreover, our analysis identifies consistent cross-cancer effects for 4 genes (FGFR1, ERRB2, IDH1, KRAS/NRAS) in 14 tumor types. We further use cell line drug response data to validate our findings.; CONCLUSIONS: This computational approach can be used to identify mutational signatures that have protein-level effects and can therefore contribute to preclinical in silico tests of the efficacy of molecular classifications as well as the druggability of individual mutations. It thus supports the identification of novel targeted therapies effective across cancers and guides efficient basket trial designs.

AB Twenty years after publication of the report To Err Is Human, studies demonstrate persisting high levels of patient harm. Most patient safety measurement remains highly retrospective, relying on voluntary reporting and post discharge administrative coding. Progress has been limited by the lack of advances in measurement accuracy, detection sensitivity, and timely actionability. The broad adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a significant opportunity to leverage digital information to improve safety measurement and management using real-time data. We developed a novel method to extract safety indicators from EHRs to identify harm and its precursors by implementing a patient safety active management system (PSAM) in hospitals within a national Patient Safety Organization (PSO). The PSAM generated validated adverse event outcomes and leveraged EHR data to develop a real-time safety predictive model. This study describes the PSAM's pilot at two large community hospitals in 2014-17. We found that the PSAM could detect harm in real time, at higher rates than current levels are detected, and that such harm could be predicted. In addition to outlining future opportunities and challenges with this EHR-enabled PSAM approach, we discuss implications and next steps for policy and practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Audit and feedback interventions may be strengthened using social interaction. The Calgary office of the Alberta Physician Learning Program (CPLP) developed a process for audit and group feedback for physicians. This paper extends previous work in which we developed a conceptual model of physician responses to audit and group feedback based on a qualitative analysis of six audit and group feedback sessions. The present study explored the mediating factors for successfully engaging physician groups in change planning through audit and group feedback.; METHODS: To understand why some groups were more interactive than others, we completed a comparative case analysis of the six audit and group feedback projects from the prior study. We used framework analysis to build the case studies, triangulated our observations across data sources to validate findings, compared the case studies for similarities and differences that influenced social interaction (mediating factors), and thematically categorized mediating factors into an organizing framework.; RESULTS: Mediating factors for socially interactive AGFS were a pre-existing relationship between the program team and the physician group, projects addressing important, actionable questions, easily interpretable data visualization in the reports, and facilitation of the groups that included reflective questioning. When these factors were in place (cases 1, 2A, 3), the audit and group feedback sessions were dynamic, with physicians sharing and comparing practices, and raising change cues (such as declaring commitments to de-prescribing, planning educational interventions, and improving documentation). In cases 2C-D, the mediating factors were less well established and in these cases, the sessions showed little physician reflection or change planning. We organized the mediating factors into a framework linking the factors for successful sessions to the conceptual model of physician behaviors which these mediating factors drive.; CONCLUSIONS: We propose the Calgary Audit and Feedback Framework as a practical tool to help foster socially constructed learning in audit and group feedback sessions. Ensuring that the four factors, relationship, question choice, data visualization, and facilitation, are considered for design and implementation of audit and group feedback will help physicians move from reactions to their data towards planning for change.

AB Food purchasing and consumption behaviors have implications for nutrition and obesity. Food retail environments, in particular, shape customer food choices and energy intake. The marketing literature offers insights about how public health practitioners can work within food retail environments to encourage healthy food choices. We reviewed experimental studies in the marketing literature to examine factors influencing customer purchase intentions and choice for food products in retail stores. Database searches were conducted in February 2016 for original, empirical articles published in English from 2000⁻2015 in marketing journals. Each research article included at least one experimental design study conducted in a real or simulated retail environment with purchase intentions or choice of food products as an outcome variable. Backward and forward reference searches were conducted for articles meeting inclusion criteria. Narrative synthesis methods were used to thematically group and summarize the findings of forty-one articles that met inclusion criteria into three categories: shelf display and product factors, pricing and price promotion factors, and in-store and customer decision-making factors. This research contributes to the literature by providing specific and actionable approaches that can increase/decrease customer purchase intentions and choice for food products in retail environments. Translating marketing strategies into public health applications can provide recommendations for future intervention research and policy related to customer food purchasing behavior.

AB Importance: Three-dimensional (3-D) printing of temporal bones is becoming more prevalent. However, there has been no measure of the safety of drilling these models to date. It is unknown whether the heat and sheer from the drill may create harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs).; Objective: To determine the level of exposure to airborne contaminants when conducting high-speed drilling on 3-D-printed models and to explore whether there is a need for exposure control measures.; Design, Setting, and Participants: In this occupational safety assessment carried out in a temporal bone laboratory, 3 individual 3-D-printed temporal bones were made using 3 different materials commonly cited in the literature: polylactic acid (PLA), photoreactive acrylic resin (PAR), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Each model was drilled for 40 minutes while the surgeon wore a sampling badge. Sampling was conducted for airborne concentrations of VOCs and total particulate (TP). Monitoring for VOCs was conducted using Assay Technology 521-25 organic vapor badge worn at the surgeon's neckline. Monitoring for TP was conducted using a polyvinyl chloride filter housed inside a cassette and coupled with an SKC AirChek 52 personal air-sampling pump. Samples were collected and analyzed in accordance with NIOSH Method 500.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of VOCs and TP count exposures at Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) actionable levels.; Results: Results of the VOC sample were less than detection limits except for isopropyl alcohol at 0.24 ppm for PAR. The TP samples were less than the detection limit of 1.4 mg/m3. The results are below all applicable OSHA Action Levels and Permissible Exposure Limits for all contaminants sampled for.; Conclusions and Relevance: Drilling 3-D-printed models made from PLA, ABS, and PAR was safe by OSHA standards. Continued monitoring and safety testing are needed as 3-D-printed technologies are introduced to our specialty.

AB Purpose: Targeted therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of advanced EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Next-generation sequencing (NGS), the preferred method for genotyping, typically requires several weeks. Here, we assessed workflows designed to rapidly identify patients with actionable EGFR mutations and reduce time to initiation (TTI) of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy.; Patients and Methods: We performed rapid testing for EGFR L858R mutations and exon 19 deletions on paraffin-embedded or frozen section biopsy specimens from newly diagnosed patients with metastatic NSCLC by using an EGFR-specific assay (rapid test). To determine clinical utility, we assessed concordance with NGS results, turnaround time, and TTI of EGFR therapy, and we evaluated reimbursement data.; Results: Between January 2015 and September 2017, we performed 243 rapid EGFR tests and identified EGFR mutations in 43 patients (18%). With NGS results as a reference, sensitivity and specificity of the rapid EGFR polymerase chain reaction assay were 98% and 100%, respectively. The median turnaround time for NGS was 14 days, compared with 7 days for rapid testing (P < .001). In the rapid group, 95% of patients received an EGFR inhibitor in the first-line setting. The median TTI of EGFR therapy was significantly shorter in the rapid cohort when compared with 121 historical cases (22 v 37 days; P = .01). Escalation of the initiative into an interdisciplinary ultra-rapid next-day frozen-section workflow for highly symptomatic patients (n = 8) resulted in a reduction in the median (± standard deviation) turnaround time to 1 ± 0.4 days and allowed several patients to initiate therapy within 1 week of biopsy. An extended 9-month clinical evaluation phase confirmed operational sustainability (turnaround times: ultra-rapid, 0.81 ± 0.4 days; rapid, 3 ± 1.5 days), and a 63% reimbursement rate indicated financial sustainability.; Conclusion: Rapid genotyping facilitates earlier initiation of EGFR-directed therapies without compromising NGS workflows.

AB The importance of incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in clinical informatics research has been increasingly recognized over the past years, and has led to transformative advances. Typically, clinical NLP systems are developed and evaluated on word, sentence, or document level annotations that model specific attributes and features, such as document content (e.g., patient status, or report type), document section types (e.g., current medications, past medical history, or discharge summary), named entities and concepts (e.g., diagnoses, symptoms, or treatments) or semantic attributes (e.g., negation, severity, or temporality). From a clinical perspective, on the other hand, research studies are typically modelled and evaluated on a patient- or population-level, such as predicting how a patient group might respond to specific treatments or patient monitoring over time. While some NLP tasks consider predictions at the individual or group user level, these tasks still constitute a minority. Owing to the discrepancy between scientific objectives of each field, and because of differences in methodological evaluation priorities, there is no clear alignment between these evaluation approaches. Here we provide a broad summary and outline of the challenging issues involved in defining appropriate intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods for NLP research that is to be used for clinical outcomes research, and vice versa. A particular focus is placed on mental health research, an area still relatively understudied by the clinical NLP research community, but where NLP methods are of notable relevance. Recent advances in clinical NLP method development have been significant, but we propose more emphasis needs to be placed on rigorous evaluation for the field to advance further. To enable this, we provide actionable suggestions, including a minimal protocol that could be used when reporting clinical NLP method development and its evaluation. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a liquid biopsy marker that can carry signatures (i.e., mutations) associated with certain pathological conditions. Therefore, the extraction of cfDNA from a variety of clinical samples can be an effective and minimally invasive source of markers for disease detection and subsequent management. In the oncological diseases, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a cfDNA sub-class, can carry clinically actionable mutations and coupled with next generation sequencing or other mutation detection methods provide a venue for effective in vitro diagnostics. However, cfDNA mutational analyses require high quality inputs. This necessitates extraction platforms that provide high recovery over the entire ctDNA size range (50  150 bp) with minimal interferences (i.e., co-extraction of genomic DNA), and high reproducibility with a simple workflow. Herein, we present a novel microfluidic solid-phase extraction device (muSPE) consisting of a plastic chip that is activated with UV/O3 to generate surface-confined carboxylic acid functionalities for the muSPE of cfDNA. The muSPE uses an immobilization buffer (IB) consisting of polyethylene glycol and salts that induce cfDNA condensation onto the activated plastic microfluidic surface. The muSPE consists of an array of micropillars to increase extraction bed load (scalable to loads >700 ng of cfDNA) and can be produced at low-cost using replication-based techniques. The entire muSPE can be fabricated in a single molding step negating the need for adding additional extraction supports to the device simplifying production and keeping device and assay cost low. The muSPE allowed for recoveries >90% of model cfDNA fragments across a range of sizes (100-700 bp) and even the ability to extract efficiently short cfDNA fragments (50 bp, >70%). In addition, the composition of the IB allowed for reducing the interference of co-extracted genomic DNA. We demonstrated the clinical utility of the muSPE by quantifying the levels of cfDNA in healthy donors and patients with non-small-cell lung and colorectal cancers. muSPE extracted cfDNA from plasma samples was also subjected to a ligase detection reaction (LDR) for determining the presence of mutations in the KRAS gene for colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer patients.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify clinically actionable genetic variants from targeted sequencing of 68 disease-related genes, estimate their penetrance, and assess the impact of disclosing results to participants and providers.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study investigates outcomes following the return of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in 68 disease-related genes. The study was initiated in December 2016 and is ongoing. Targeted sequencing was performed in 2533 individuals with hyperlipidemia or colon polyps. The electronic health records (EHRs) of participants carrying P/LP variants in 36 cardiovascular disease (CVD) genes were manually reviewed to ascertain the presence of relevant traits. Clinical outcomes, health care utilization, family communication, and ethical and psychosocial implications of disclosure of genomic results are being assessed by surveys, telephone interviews, and EHR review.; RESULTS: Of 29,208 variants in the 68 genes, 1915 were rare (frequency <1%) and putatively functional, and 102 of these (60 in 36 CVD genes) were labeled P/LP based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics framework. Manual review of the EHRs of participants (n=73 with P/LP variants in CVD genes) revealed that 33 had the expected trait(s); however, only 6 of 45 participants with non-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) P/LP variants had the expected traits.; CONCLUSION: Expected traits were present in 13% of participants with P/LP variants in non-FH CVD genes, suggesting low penetrance; this estimate may change with additional testing performed as part of the clinical evaluation. Ongoing analyses of the RAVE Study will inform best practices for genomic medicine. Copyright © 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. All rights reserved.

AB Over a century ago, Abraham Flexner's landmark report on medical education resulted in the most extensive reforms of medical training in history. They led to major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and the relief of suffering. His prediction that "the physician's function is fast becoming social and preventive, rather than individual and curative," however, was never realized.Instead, with the rise of biomedical science, the scientific method and the American Medical Association, the health care system became increasingly distanced from a holistic approach to life that recognizes the critical role social determinants play in people's health. These developments created the beginning of the regulatory controls that have come to define and shape American health care - and our unhealthy obsession with illness, disease and curative medicine that has resulted in a system that has little to do with health.To realize Flexner's prediction, and to transform health care into a holistic system whose primary goals are focused on health outcomes, six disruptive interventions are proposed. First, health needs to be placed in the context of community. Second, the model of primary care needs to be revised. Third, big data need to be harnessed to provide personalized, consumable, and actionable health knowledge. Fourth, there needs to greater patient engagement, but with fewer face-to-face encounters.Fifth, we need revitalized, collaborative medical training for physicians. And finally, true transformation will require market-driven, not regulatory-constrained, innovation. The evolution from health care to health demands consumer-driven choices that only a deregulated, free market can provide.

AB Incomplete understanding of the metastatic process hinders personalized therapy. Here we report the most comprehensive whole-genome study of colorectal metastases vs. matched primary tumors. 65% of somatic mutations originate from a common progenitor, with 15% being tumor- and 19% metastasis-specific, implicating a higher mutation rate in metastases. Tumor- and metastasis-specific mutations harbor elevated levels of BRCAness. We confirm multistage progression with new components ARHGEF7/ARHGEF33. Recurrently mutated non-coding elements include ncRNAs RP11-594N15.3, AC010091, SNHG14, 3' UTRs of FOXP2, DACH2, TRPM3, XKR4, ANO5, CBL, CBLB, the latter four potentially dual protagonists in metastasis and efferocytosis-/PD-L1 mediated immunosuppression. Actionable metastasis-specific lesions include FAT1, FGF1, BRCA2, KDR, and AKT2-, AKT3-, and PDGFRA-3' UTRs. Metastasis specific mutations are enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling, cell adhesion, ECM and hepatic stellate activation genes, suggesting genetic programs for site-specific colonization. Our results put forward hypotheses on tumor and metastasis evolution, and evidence for metastasis-specific events relevant for personalized therapy.

AB Fusions involving the oncogenic gene RET have been observed in thyroid and lung cancers. Here we report RET gene alterations, including amplification, missense mutations, known fusions, novel fusions, and rearrangements in breast cancer. Their frequency, oncogenic potential, and actionability in breast cancer are described. Two out of eight RET fusions (NCOA4-RET and a novel RASGEF1A-RET fusion) and RET amplification were functionally characterized and shown to activate RET kinase and drive signaling through MAPK and PI3K pathways. These fusions and RET amplification can induce transformation of non-tumorigenic cells, support xenograft tumor formation, and render sensitivity to RET inhibition. An index case of metastatic breast cancer progressing on HER2-targeted therapy was found to have the NCOA4-RET fusion. Subsequent treatment with the RET inhibitor cabozantinib led to a rapid clinical and radiographic response. RET alterations, identified by genomic profiling, are promising therapeutic targets and are present in a subset of breast cancers.

AB The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is a critical regulator of proliferation, apoptosis, and cell fate. The main downstream effector of this pathway, YAP, has been shown to be misregulated in human cancer and has emerged as an attractive target for therapeutics. A significant insufficiency in our understanding of the pathway is the identity of transcriptional targets of YAP that drive its potent growth phenotypes. Here, using liver cancer as a model, we identify NUAK2 as an essential mediator of YAP-driven hepatomegaly and tumorigenesis in vivo. By evaluating several human cancer cell lines we determine that NUAK2 is selectively required for YAP-driven growth. Mechanistically, we found that NUAK2 participates in a feedback loop to maximize YAP activity via promotion of actin polymerization and myosin activity. Additionally, pharmacological inactivation of NUAK2 suppresses YAP-dependent cancer cell proliferation and liver overgrowth. Importantly, our work here identifies a specific, potent, and actionable target for YAP-driven malignancies.

AB Objective: Medication non-adherence is a substantial problem among patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA). Our aim was to explore IA patients' perspectives on strategies to support medication adherence.; Methods: We collaborated with a leading arthritis patient group and conducted a qualitative study on individuals with IA who were taking at least one medication for their IA. An experienced facilitator led participants through a focus group exercise where participants were asked to design, and then discuss, strategies and/or tools supporting medication use. We applied thematic analysis using an iterative, constant comparative approach.; Results: We studied six focus groups with 27 participants diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and comparatively under-represented conditions in this research area such as Sjogren's syndrome. Five themes emerged throughout the analysis. Two themes - 1) adapting to life with IA and 2) the complexities and dynamic nature of taking medications - describe learning to live with a chronic condition and the challenges encountered when using long-term medications. Three themes - 3) developing lifestyle strategies for medication use (eg, having physical reminders and prompts), 4) becoming informed about medications (eg, information at time of diagnosis, means of receiving information) and 5) receiving support (eg, from health care team members, from family) - offer perspectives on facilitators to medication use. From the relationship between the latter themes, a framework was developed that encompasses means of receiving information and support as actionable targets for patient-oriented adherence interventions for IA.; Conclusion: This patient-oriented study highlights the importance of developing timely adherence interventions for IA. Our findings also led to a framework describing means of receiving information, such as through digital media and support, including from health care team members and family, as actionable targets for patient-oriented adherence interventions for IA.

AB BACKGROUND: A primary variant of social media, online support groups (OSG) extend beyond the standard definition to incorporate a dimension of advice, support and guidance for patients. OSG are complementary, yet significant adjunct to patient journeys. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques can be applied to these large volumes of unstructured text discussions accumulated in OSG for intelligent extraction of patient-reported demographics, behaviours, decisions, treatment, side effects and expressions of emotions. New insights from the fusion and synthesis of such diverse patient-reported information, as expressed throughout the patient journey from diagnosis to treatment and recovery, can contribute towards informed decision-making on personalized healthcare delivery and the development of healthcare policy guidelines.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have designed and developed an artificial intelligence based analytics framework using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for intelligent analysis and automated aggregation of patient information and interaction trajectories in online support groups. Alongside the social interactions aspect, patient behaviours, decisions, demographics, clinical factors, emotions, as subsequently expressed over time, are extracted and analysed. More specifically, we utilised this platform to investigate the impact of online social influences on the intimate decision scenario of selecting a treatment type, recovery after treatment, side effects and emotions expressed over time, using prostate cancer as a model. Results manifest the three major decision-making behaviours among patients, Paternalistic group, Autonomous group and Shared group. Furthermore, each group demonstrated diverse behaviours in post-decision discussions on clinical outcomes, advice and expressions of emotion during the twelve months following treatment. Over time, the transition of patients from information and emotional support seeking behaviours to providers of information and emotional support to other patients was also observed.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study are a rigorous indication of the expectations of social media empowered patients, their potential for individualised decision-making, clinical and emotional needs. The increasing popularity of OSG further confirms that it is timely for clinicians to consider patient voices as expressed in OSG. We have successfully demonstrated that the proposed platform can be utilised to investigate, analyse and derive actionable insights from patient-reported information on prostate cancer, in support of patient focused healthcare delivery. The platform can be extended and applied just as effectively to any other medical condition.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of Teach-Back on communication quality in a national telephone-based telehealth service, for callers varying in health literacy.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomised trial with continuous recruitment, short (fixed) exposure and blinded outcome assessors. Nurses were stratified by hours worked and randomised into training groups using a computer generated sequence.; SETTING: An Australian national pregnancy and parenting telephone helpline.; INTERVENTION: Complex intervention involving a single 2-hour group Teach-Back training session, combined with ongoing nurse self-reflection on their communication following each call and each shift.; PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 637 callers to the telephone helpline aged 18-75 (87% female), of whom 127 (13%) had inadequate health literacy (measured with the Single Item Literacy Screener); and 15 maternal and child health nurses with 15 years' experience on average.; MEASURES: Primary outcome was a modified subscale of the Health Literacy Questionnaire, 'having sufficient information to manage health'. Secondary caller outcomes included caller confidence, perceived actionability of information and nurse effort to listen and understand. Nurse outcomes were perceptions of their communication effectiveness.; RESULTS: Over a 7 week period, 376 surveyed callers received usual care and 261 Teach-Back. Ratings on the primary outcome increased over time (OR 1.17, CI 1.01 to 1.32, p = 0.03) but no independent Teach-Back effect was observed. A consistent pattern suggests that, compared with usual care, Teach-Back helps callers with inadequate health literacy feel listened to (OR 2.3, CI 0.98 to 5.42, p = 0.06), confident to act (OR 2.44, CI 1.00 to 5.98, p = 0.06), and know what steps to take (OR 2.68, CI 1.00 to 7.17, p = 0.06). Nurse perceptions of both their own communication effectiveness (OR = 2.31; CI 1.38 to 3.86, p<0.0001), and caller understanding (OR = 2.56; CI 1.52 to 4.30, p<0.001) both increased with Teach-Back. No harms were reported.; CONCLUSIONS: Teach-Back appears to benefit telephone health service users with inadequate health literacy, but the extent of this is unclear due to smaller numbers of lower literacy participants. Improving caller ratings over time are likely due to increasing nurse communication competence.

AB BACKGROUND: High quality primary care is fundamental to achieving health for all. Research priority setting is a key facilitator of improving how research activity responds to concrete needs. There has never before been an attempt to identify international primary care research priorities, in order to guide resource allocation and to enhance global primary care. This study aimed to identify a list of top 10 primary care research priorities, as identified by members of the public, health professionals working in primary care, researchers, and policymakers.; METHODS: We adapted the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership process, to conduct multiple rounds of stakeholder recruitment and prioritization. The study included an online survey conducted in three languages, followed by an in-person priority setting exercise involving primary care stakeholders from 13 countries.; FINDINGS: Participants identified a list of top 10 international primary care research priorities. These were focused on diverse topics such as enhancing use of information and communication technology, and improving integration of indigenous communities' knowledge in the design of primary care services. The main limitations of the study related to challenges in engaging an adequate diversity and number of appropriate stakeholders, particularly members of the public, in aggregating the diverse set of responses into coherent categories representative of the participants' perspectives and in adequately representing the diversity of submitted responses while ensuring research priorities on the final list are sufficiently actionable to guide resource allocation.; CONCLUSIONS: The top 10 identified research priorities have the potential to guide research resource allocation, supporting funding agencies and initiatives to promote global primary care research and practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinicians in intensive care units experience alarm fatigue related to frequent false and non-actionable alarms produced by physiologic monitors. To reduce non-actionable alarms, alarm settings may need to be customized for individual patients; however, nurses may not customize alarms because of competing demands and alarm fatigue.; OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness and acceptance of physiologic monitor software to support customization of alarms.; METHODS: This pre/post intervention study was conducted in a 56-bed medical intensive care unit. IntelliVue Alarm Advisor customization support software for alarm limit violations was installed on all monitors and education on its use provided. For 2 months before and after implementation of the software, data were collected on patient characteristics from the electronic health record, alarm counts and duration from the monitoring system, and nurses' experience of alarms from a survey.; RESULTS: Medium-priority heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial pressure alarms were significantly reduced after software implementation (9.3%, 11.8%, and 15.9% reduction respectively; p<0.001 for all). The duration of these alarms was also significantly shorter (7.8%, 13.3%, and 9.3% reduction respectively; p<0.05 for all). The number and duration of SpO2 alarms did not decrease (p>0.05 for both). Patients post-intervention had worse Glasgow Coma Scale scores (p = 0.014), but otherwise were comparable to those pre-intervention. Nurses reported less time spent on non-actionable alarms post-intervention than pre-intervention (p = 0.026). Also lower post-intervention were the proportions of nurses who reported that alarms disturbed their workflow (p = 0.027) and who encountered a situation where an important alarm was ignored (p = 0.043). The majority (>50%) agreed that the software supported setting appropriate alarm limits and was easy to use.; CONCLUSION: Alarm customization software was associated with a reduction in alarms. Use of software to support nurses' recognition of trends in patients' alarms and facilitate changes to alarm settings may add value to alarm reduction initiatives.

AB The abortion and mental health controversy is driven by two different perspectives regarding how best to interpret accepted facts. When interpreting the data, abortion and mental health proponents are inclined to emphasize risks associated with abortion, whereas abortion and mental health minimalists emphasize pre-existing risk factors as the primary explanation for the correlations with more negative outcomes. Still, both sides agree that (a) abortion is consistently associated with elevated rates of mental illness compared to women without a history of abortion; (b) the abortion experience directly contributes to mental health problems for at least some women; (c) there are risk factors, such as pre-existing mental illness, that identify women at greatest risk of mental health problems after an abortion; and (d) it is impossible to conduct research in this field in a manner that can definitively identify the extent to which any mental illnesses following abortion can be reliably attributed to abortion in and of itself. The areas of disagreement, which are more nuanced, are addressed at length. Obstacles in the way of research and further consensus include (a) multiple pathways for abortion and mental health risks, (b) concurrent positive and negative reactions, (c) indeterminate time frames and degrees of reactions, (d) poorly defined terms, (e) multiple factors of causation, and (f) inherent preconceptions based on ideology and disproportionate exposure to different types of women. Recommendations for collaboration include (a) mixed research teams, (b) co-design of national longitudinal prospective studies accessible to any researcher, (c) better adherence to data sharing and re-analysis standards, and (d) attention to a broader list of research questions.

AB Existing methods to improve detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have focused on genomic alterations but have rarely considered the biological properties of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). We hypothesized that differences in fragment lengths of circulating DNA could be exploited to enhance sensitivity for detecting the presence of ctDNA and for noninvasive genomic analysis of cancer. We surveyed ctDNA fragment sizes in 344 plasma samples from 200 patients with cancer using low-pass whole-genome sequencing (0.4*). To establish the size distribution of mutant ctDNA, tumor-guided personalized deep sequencing was performed in 19 patients. We detected enrichment of ctDNA in fragment sizes between 90 and 150 bp and developed methods for in vitro and in silico size selection of these fragments. Selecting fragments between 90 and 150 bp improved detection of tumor DNA, with more than twofold median enrichment in >95% of cases and more than fourfold enrichment in >10% of cases. Analysis of size-selected cfDNA identified clinically actionable mutations and copy number alterations that were otherwise not detected. Identification of plasma samples from patients with advanced cancer was improved by predictive models integrating fragment length and copy number analysis of cfDNA, with area under the curve (AUC) >0.99 compared to AUC <0.80 without fragmentation features. Increased identification of cfDNA from patients with glioma, renal, and pancreatic cancer was achieved with AUC > 0.91 compared to AUC < 0.5 without fragmentation features. Fragment size analysis and selective sequencing of specific fragment sizes can boost ctDNA detection and could complement or provide an alternative to deeper sequencing of cfDNA.

AB Diversity in drug response is attributed to both genetic and non-genetic factors. However, there is paucity of pharmacogenetics information across ethnically and genetically diverse populations of India. Here, we have analyzed 21 SNPs from 12 pharmacogenomics genes in Punjabi Sikhs of Indian origin (N=1,616), as part of the Sikh Diabetes Study (SDS). We compared the allele frequency of poor metabolism (PM) phenotype among Sikhs across other major global populations from the Exome Aggregation Consortium and 1000 Genomes. The PM phenotype of CYP1A2*1F for slow metabolism of caffeine and carcinogens was significantly higher in Indians (SDS 42%, GIH [Gujarati] 51%, SAS [Pakistani] 45%) compared to Europeans 29% (pgenotype=5.3E-05). Similarly, South Asians had a significantly higher frequency of CYP2C9*3 (12% SDS, 13% GIH, 11% SAS) vs. 7% in Europeans (pgenotype=<1.0E-05) and 'T' allele of CYP4F2 (36%) SDS, (43%) GIH, 40% (SAS) vs. (29%) in Europeans (pgenotype=<1.0E-05); both associated with a higher risk of bleeding with warfarin. All South Asians -the Sikhs (0.36), GIH (0.34), and SAS (0.36) had a higher frequency of the NAT2*6 allele (linked with slow acetylation of isoniazid) compared to Europeans (0.29). Additionally, the prevalence of the low activity 'C' allele of MTHFR (rs1801131) was highest in Sikhs compared to all other ethnic groups [SDS (44%), GIH (39%), SAS (42%) and European (32%) (pgenotype=<1.0E-05)]. SNPs in MTHFR affect metabolism of statins, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate-based cancer drugs. These findings underscore the need for evaluation of other endogamous ethnic groups of India and beyond for establishing a global benchmark for pre-emptive genotyping in drug metabolizing genes before beginning therapeutic intervention.

AB The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytoplasmic receptor and transcription factor activated through cognate ligand binding. It is an important factor in immunity and tissue homeostasis, and structurally diverse compounds from the environment, diet, microbiome, and host metabolism can induce AhR activity. Emerging evidence suggests that AhR is a key sensor allowing immune cells to adapt to environmental conditions and changes in AhR activity have been associated with autoimmune disorders and cancer. Furthermore, AhR agonists or antagonists can impact immune disease outcomes identifying AhR as a potentially actionable target for immunotherapy. In this review, we describe known ligands stimulating AhR activity, downstream proinflammatory and suppressive mechanisms potentiated by AhR, and how this understanding is being applied to immunopathology to help control disease outcomes.

AB Meningiomas are among the most common tumors of the adult central nervous system (CNS). They are classified by the World Health Organization into three pathologic grades with increasing severity: grade I are benign with favorable treatment outcomes and low recurrence rates while grade III display malignant behavior and poor progression-free survival. Previous studies have shown that inactivation of NF-2 is the most common genetic event in high-grade meningioma; however, there is dearth of molecular data to distinguish grade II (AM-II) from the even more aggressive grade III (AM-III). As part of a routine diagnostic workup, 19 AM-II and 5 AM-III were submitted for targeted sequencing on a panel of twenty-four genes relevant to CNS tumors. The data generated during the course of clinical care was collected and re-analyzed with the aim of identifying molecular features to distinguish AM-II and AM-III. Our cases contained several well-characterized, potentially actionable mutations, but we did not find any novel, recurrent sequence variants. Copy number variations were common in both AM-II and AM-III; chr22q loss was the most prevalent followed in decreasing frequency by losses of chr1p, chr14q, and chr10. In particular, chr10 loss was noted in 4 of 5 AM-III cases but none of the AM-II cases. This suggests that chr10 loss may serve as a diagnostic and perhaps a prognostic marker to differentiate AM-II from AM-III. If confirmed in larger studies, our finding could further aid the classification of meningioma. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Natural history studies of tuberculosis (TB) have revealed a spectrum of clinical outcomes after exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of TB. Not all individuals exposed to the bacterium will become diseased and depending on the infection pressure, many will remain infection-free. Intriguingly, complete resistance to infection is observed in some individuals (termed resisters) after intense, continuing M. tuberculosis exposure. After successful infection, the majority of individuals will develop latent TB infection (LTBI). This infection state is currently (and perhaps imperfectly) defined by the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and/or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), but no detectable clinical disease symptoms. The majority of healthy individuals with LTBI are resistant to clinical TB, indicating that infection is remarkably well-contained in these non-progressors. The remaining 5-15% of LTBI positive individuals will progress to active TB. Epidemiological investigations have indicated that the host genetic component contributes to these infection and disease phenotypes, influencing both susceptibility and resistance. Elucidating these genetic correlates is therefore a priority as it may translate to new interventions to prevent, diagnose or treat TB. The most successful approaches in resistance/susceptibility investigation have focused on specific infection and disease phenotypes and the resister phenotype may hold the key to the discovery of actionable genetic variants in TB infection and disease. This review will not only discuss lessons from epidemiological studies, but will also focus on the contribution of epidemiology and functional genetics to human genetic resistance to M. tuberculosis infection and disease.

AB The arterial switch operation (ASO) in complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA) has increased long-term survival. Annual follow-up echocardiograms are recommended, but evidence-based guidelines do not exist. We sought to assess how often a patient with TGA after ASO who had no symptoms or change in physical exam underwent an intervention based solely on echocardiographic changes. We retrospectively reviewed all records from patients with TGA and a history of ASO followed at our institution between November 1983 and January 2015. Changes in echocardiograms resulting in hospital admission, significant medication change, interventional catheterization, or surgical procedure were identified through the surgical and cardiac catheterization laboratory databases and patient charts. These changes were referred to as an actionable change (AC). Interventions were defined as being driven by either clinical (change in physical exam, patient and/or parental concerns) or echocardiographic findings. A total of 1,792 echocardiograms from 149 patients were reviewed. Median number of echocardiograms per patient was 12 (1 to 34). Of the 1,792 echocardiograms, 20 (1.12%) were associated with AC. The most common intervention for an AC was cardiac catheterization (13 of 20, 65%). Most AC (15 of 20, 75%) occurred in the first decade after ASO. AC occurred in 83% (5 of 6) of those with a history of both ASO and arch repair. Annual echocardiograms in patients with TGA after ASO are rarely useful and are unnecessary. In conclusion, decreasing surveillance of asymptomatic patients to biennial follow-up echocardiograms in asymptomatic patients without physical examination changes is safe and would decrease medical expenses.

AB In a multicellular organism, somatic mutations represent a permanent record of the past chemical and biochemical perturbations experienced by a cell in its local microenvironment. Akin to a perpetual recording device, with every replication, genomic DNA accumulates mutations in patterns that reflect: i) the sequence context-dependent formation of DNA damage, due to environmental or endogenous reactive species, including spontaneous processes; ii) the activity of DNA repair pathways, which, depending on the type of lesion, can erase, ignore or exacerbate the mutagenic consequences of that DNA damage; and iii) the choice of replication machinery that synthesizes the nascent genomic copy. These three factors result in a richly contoured sequence context-dependent mutational spectrum that, from appearances, is distinct for most individual forms of DNA damage. Such a mutagenic legacy, if appropriately decoded, can reveal the local history of genome-altering events such as chemical or pathogen exposures, metabolic stress, and inflammation, which in turn can provide an indication of the underlying causes and mechanisms of genetic disease. Modern tools have positioned us to develop a deep mechanistic understanding of the cellular factors and pathways that modulate a mutational process and, in turn, provide opportunities for better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, better exposure risk assessment and even actionable therapeutic targets. The goal of this Perspective is to present a bottom-up, lesion-centric framework of mutagenesis that integrates the contributions of lesion replication, lesion repair and lesion formation to explain the complex mutational spectra that emerge in the genome following exposure to mutagens. The mutational spectra of the well-studied hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 are showcased here as specific examples, but the implications are meant to be generalizable. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The variant curation guidelines published in 2015 by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) provided the genetics community with a framework to assess variant pathogenicity; however, these rules are not gene specific. Germline pathogenic variants in the CDH1 gene cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer, a clinically challenging cancer predisposition syndrome that often requires a multidisciplinary team of experts to be properly managed. Given this challenge, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Hereditary Cancer Domain prioritized the development of the CDH1 variant curation expert panel (VCEP) to develop and implement rules for CDH1 variant classifications. Here, we describe the CDH1 specifications of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, which were developed and validated after a systematic evaluation of variants obtained from a cohort of clinical laboratory data encompassing 827,000 CDH1 sequenced alleles. Comparing previously reported germline variants that were classified using the 2015 ACMG/AMP guidelines to the CDH1 VCEP recommendations resulted in reduced variants of uncertain significance and facilitated resolution of variants with conflicted assertions in ClinVar. The ClinGen CDH1 VCEP recommends the use of these CDH1-specific guidelines for the assessment and classification of variants identified in this clinically actionable gene. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The use of genome-scale sequencing allows for identification of genetic findings beyond the original indication for testing (secondary findings). The ClinGen Actionability Working Group's (AWG) protocol for evidence synthesis and semi-quantitative metric scoring evaluates four domains of clinical actionability for potential secondary findings: severity and likelihood of the outcome, and effectiveness and nature of the intervention. As of February 2018, the AWG has scored 127 genes associated with 78 disorders (up-to-date topics/scores are available at www.clinicalgenome.org). Scores across these disorders were assessed to compare genes/disorders recommended for return as secondary findings by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) with those not currently recommended. Disorders recommended by the ACMG scored higher on outcome-related domains (severity and likelihood), but not on intervention-related domains (effectiveness and nature of the intervention). Current practices indicate that return of secondary findings will expand beyond those currently recommended by the ACMG. The ClinGen AWG evidence reports and summary scores are not intended as classifications of actionability, rather they provide a resource to aid decision makers as they determine best practices regarding secondary findings. The ClinGen AWG is working with the ACMG Secondary Findings Committee to update future iterations of their secondary findings list. © Published 2018.

AB The incidence of sparganosis, a parasitic disease caused by plerocercoid larvae of the genus Spirometra, has gradually risen worldwide (especially in remote areas) in recent years. Pulmonary and pleural sparganosis, as well as other sites of infestation, including the subcutaneous tissues, the abdominal viscera, brain and eyes, has been reported. In clinical practice, due to the atypical signs and symptoms as well as limited laboratory approaches for the specific detection of sparganum, sparganosis is often misdiagnosed. In the present study, an 11-year-old girl visited the Department of Infectious Diseases in Shanghai Children's Medical Center for recurrent shoulder and chest pain and shortness of breath. Imaging tests demonstrated bilateral pleural and pericardial effusion, enlarged lymph nodes in front of the tracheal carina, and infection of the left lower lobe. Sparganum were not observed in the dissected soft tissue at the root of the right thigh with naked-eye and light microscopy examination. Histologic examination revealed granulomatous inflammation and tunnel-like necrosis with eosinophilic, neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration. Although the patient's serum was positive for sparganum antibodies, the diagnosis of sparganosis was not confirmed for more than three months. Ultimately, genomic DNA of Spirometra erinaceieuropaei was detected in the mass at the root of the right thigh using next-generation sequencing (NGS), confirming the diagnosis of sparganosis. The patient was treated with praziquantel (150 mg/kg/day) without recurrence after an eight-month follow-up. We present, for the first time, a study of human sparganosis diagnosed using NGS, which provided a clinically actionable diagnosis of a specific infectious disease from an uncommon pathogen.

AB BACKGROUND: Precision medicine aims to link molecular targets in tumours with corresponding therapies, particularly for patients with rare cancers. Innovative approaches are needed to translate molecular opportunities into clinical care. The Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) program employs a molecular screening platform to identify molecular changes of therapeutic relevance (actionable changes) and a master protocol for multiple, parallel signal-seeking clinical substudies, focused on therapies for patients with rare and neglected cancers. Methods and analysis: Archival pathology laboratory samples from patients with treatment-refractory advanced solid cancer of any histologic type undergo molecular tumour profiling. Following review by a Molecular Tumour Board, eligible patients are offered treatment in therapeutic substudies. This novel master protocol allows expedited addition of individual substudies; at least 12 open label, single arm, signal-seeking substudies during the initial 4 years of MoST are planned. The primary objectives are to identify signals of efficacy for developing biomarker-driven therapies and biomarkers that more accurately predict response to therapy, as well as to evaluate the MoST design. Ethics approval: The program has been approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (reference, HREC/16/SVH/23). Dissemination of results: A report summarising and interpreting collected study data will be published. Our findings will be presented at national and international conferences and scientific meetings, and published in peer-reviewed journals.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12616000908437 (8 July 2016).

AB The molecular landscape of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and the neck (SCCHN) has been characterized and actionable or targetable genomic alterations have been identified. However, targeted therapies have very limited activity in unselected SCCHN, and the current treatment strategy is still based on tumor location and disease stage and not on tumor biology. Trying to select upfront the patients who will benefit from a specific treatment might be a way to improve patients' outcome. With the objective of optimizing the activity of targeted therapies and immunotherapy, we have designed an umbrella biomarker-driven study dedicated to recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN patients (EORTC-1559-HNCG, NCT03088059). In this article, we review not only the different trial designs for biomarker-driven studies with their respective advantages and opportunities but also the potential pitfalls that led to the design of the EORTC-1559-HNCG protocol. We also discuss the scientific and logistic challenges of biomarker-driven trials.

AB Unplanned hospital readmissions are a burden to the healthcare system and to the patients. To lower the readmission rates, machine learning approaches can be used to create predictive models, with the intention to provide actionable information for caregivers. According to the German Diagnosis Related Groups (G-DRG) system, for every stay in a German hospital, data are collected for the subsequent reimbursement calculations. After statistical evaluation, these data are summarised in the yearly updated Case Fee Catalogue, which not only contains the weights for the reimbursement calculations, but also the expected length of stay values. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate potential enhancements of the prediction accuracy of our 30-day readmission prediction model by utilising additional information from the Case Fee Catalogue. A bagged ensemble of 25 regression trees was applied to 21 datasets from five independent German hospitals from 2013 to 2017, resulting in 422,597 cases. The overall model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.812. Three of the top five features ranked by out of bag feature importance emerged from the Case Fee Catalogue. We conclude, that additional information from the Case Fee Catalogue can enhance the accuracy of 30-day readmission prediction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Elite controllers, defined as persons maintaining undetectable levels of HIV-1 replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, represent living evidence that sustained, natural control of HIV-1 is possible, at least in relatively rare instances. Understanding the complex immunologic and virologic characteristics of these specific patients holds promise for inducing drug-free control of HIV-1 in broader populations of HIV-1 infected patients.; DESIGN: We used an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to characterize CD8+ T cells, the strongest correlate of HIV-1 immune control identified thus far, in a large cohort of elite controllers (n = 51); highly active antiretrovial therapy (HAART)-treated patients (n = 32) and HIV-1 negative (n = 10) served as reference cohorts.; METHODS: We isolated mRNA from total CD8+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of each individual followed by microarray analysis of the transcriptional signatures.; RESULTS: We observed profound transcriptional differences [590 transcripts, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.05] between elite controller and HAART-treated patients. Interestingly, metabolic and signalling pathways governed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and eIF2, known for their key roles in regulating cellular growth, proliferation and metabolism, were among the top functions enriched in the differentially expressed genes, suggesting a therapeutically actionable target as a distinguishing feature of spontaneous HIV-1 immune control. A subsequent bootstrapping approach distinguished five different subgroups of elite controller, each characterized by distinct transcriptional signatures. However, despite this marked heterogeneity, differential regulation of mTOR and eIF2 signalling remained the dominant functional pathway in three of these elite controller subgroups.; CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that mTOR and eIF2 signalling may play a remarkably universal role for regulating CD8 T-cell function from elite controllers.

AB Non-adherence with pharmacologic treatment is associated with increased rates of relapse and rehospitalisation among patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. To improve treatment response, remission, and recovery, research efforts are still needed to elucidate how to effectively map patient's response to medication treatment including both therapeutic and adverse effects, compliance, and satisfaction in the prodromal phase of illness (ie, the time period in between direct clinical consultation and relapse). The Actionable Intime Insights (AI2) application draws information from Australian Medicare administrative claims records in real time when compliance with treatment does not meet best practice guidelines for managing chronic severe mental illness. Subsequently, the AI2 application alerts clinicians and patients when patients do not adhere to guidelines for treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the AI2 application on the risk of hospitalisation among simulated patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Monte Carlo simulation methodology was used to estimate the impact of the AI2 intervention on the probability of hospitalisation over a 2-year period. Results indicated that when the AI2 algorithmic intervention had an efficacy level of (>0.6), over 80% of actioned alerts were contributing to reduced hospitalisation risk among the simulated patients. Such findings indicate the potential utility of the AI2 application should replication studies validate its methodologic and ecological rigour in real-world settings.

AB Pediatric high grade gliomas (HGG) are primary brain malignancies that result in significant morbidity and mortality. One of the challenges in their treatment is inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to enhance diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic information. In this case study we describe the molecular characterization of a pediatric HGG and the use of an integrated approach based on genomic, in vitro and in vivo testing to identify actionable targets and treatment options. Molecular analysis based on WGS performed on initial and recurrent tumor biopsies revealed mutations in TP53, TSC1 and CIC genes, focal amplification of MYCN, and copy number gains in SMO and c-MET. Transcriptomic analysis identified increased expression of MYCN, and genes involved in sonic hedgehog signaling proteins (SHH, SMO, GLI1, GLI2) and receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (PLK, AURKA, c-MET). HTS revealed no cytotoxic efficacy of SHH pathway inhibitors while sensitivity was observed to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, and the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536. Based on the integrated approach, temsirolimus, ceritinib, BI2536 and standard therapy temozolomide were selected for further in vivo evaluation. Using the PDX animal model (median survival 28days) we showed significant in vivo activity for mTOR inhibition by temsirolimus and BI2536 (median survival 109 and 115.5days respectively) while ceritinib and temozolomide had only a moderate effect (43 and 75.5days median survival respectively). This case study demonstrates that an integrated approach based on genomic, in vitro and in vivo drug efficacy testing in a PDX model may be useful to guide the management of high risk pediatric brain tumor in a clinically meaningful timeframe.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Guidelines developed by the WHO aim to provide recommendations to support best practice in health delivery, with a focus on low-income and middle-income countries. As part of the guideline development process, critical knowledge gaps are identified and one of the core functions of WHO guidelines is to set forth priorities for future research. A review of research priorities identified through the WHO guideline development has recently been promoted as one approach to building an overarching priority research agenda in a given area. This paper outlines priorities for HIV-associated TB research identified in WHO HIV and TB guidelines published since 2015.; RECENT FINDINGS: Nine guidelines were reviewed and 29 priority research questions were identified. Research priorities were identified for prevention of HIV-associated TB (11 questions), screening of latent and active TB in people living with HIV (six questions), treatment of drug sensitive (four questions), and drug-resistant (two questions) TB, and treatment of HIV in people coinfected with TB (three questions).; SUMMARY: Multiple approaches to defining priority research questions for health research exist. Research priorities that arise from the WHO guideline development process are limited to those areas for which guidelines are developed. One strength of this approach is that it takes as a starting point a desire to make actionable recommendations for policy makers. WHO is working to further refine the formulation of research questions within the guideline development process.

AB Advances in big data analytics have created an opportunity for a step change in unraveling mechanisms underlying the development of complex diseases such as asthma, providing valuable insights that drive better diagnostic decision-making in clinical practice, and opening up paths to individualized treatment plans. However, translating findings from data-driven analyses into meaningful insights and actionable solutions requires approaches and tools which move beyond mining and patterning longitudinal data. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in phenotyping of asthma, to discuss key hurdles currently hampering the translation of phenotypic variation into mechanistic insights and clinical setting, and to suggest potential solutions that may address these limitations and accelerate moving discoveries into practice. In order to advance the field of phenotypic discovery, greater focus should be placed on investigating the extent of within-phenotype variation. We advocate a more cautious modeling approach by "supervising" the findings to delineate more precisely the characteristics of the individual trajectories assigned to each phenotype. Furthermore, it is important to employ different methods within a study to compare the stability of derived phenotypes, and to assess the immutability of individual assignments to phenotypes. If we are to make a step change toward precision (stratified or personalized) medicine and capitalize on the available big data assets, we have to develop genuine cross-disciplinary collaborations, wherein data scientists who turn data into information using algorithms and machine learning, team up with medical professionals who provide deep insights on specific subjects from a clinical perspective.

AB Early prediction of complex disorders (e.g., autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders) is one of the fundamental goals of precision medicine and personalized genomics. An early prediction of complex disorders can improve the prognosis, increase the effectiveness of interventions and treatments, and enhance the life quality of affected patients. Considering the genetic heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders, we are proposing a novel framework for utilizing rare coding variation for early prediction of these disorders in subset of affected samples. We provide a combinatorial framework for addressing this problem, denoted as Odin (Oracle for DIsorder predictioN), to make a prediction for a small, yet significant, subset of affected cases while having very low false positive rate (FPR) prediction for unaffected samples. Odin also takes advantage of the available functional information (e.g., pairwise coexpression of genes during brain development) to increase the prediction power beyond genes with recurrent variants. Application of our method accurately recovers an additional 8% of autism cases without any severe variant in known recurrent mutated genes with a <1% FPR. Furthermore, Odin predicted a set of 391 genes that severe variants in these genes can cause autism or other developmental delay disorders. Approaches such as the one presented in this paper are needed to translate the biomedical discoveries into actionable items by clinicians.

AB Health in the United States is markedly heterogeneous, with large disparities in disease incidence, treatment choices and health spending. Drug prescription is one major component of health care-reflecting the accuracy of diagnosis, the adherence to evidence-based guidelines, susceptibility to drug marketing and regulatory factors. Using medical claims data covering nearly half of the USA population, we have developed and validated a framework to compare prescription rates of 600 popular drugs in 2334 counties. Our approach uncovers geographically separated sub-Americas, where patients receive treatment for different diseases, and where physicians choose different drugs for the same disease. The geographical variation suggests influences of racial composition, state-level health care laws and wealth. Some regions consistently prefer more expensive drugs, even when they have not been proven more efficacious than cheaper alternatives. Our study underlines the benefit of aggregating massive information on medical practice into a summarized and actionable form.

AB Biliary tracts cancers (BTCs) are a diverse group of aggressive malignancies with an overall poor prognosis. Genomic characterization has uncovered many putative clinically actionable aberrations that can also facilitate the prognostication of patients. As such, comprehensive genomic profiling is playing a growing role in the clinical management of BTCs. Currently however, there is only one precision medicine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of BTCs. Herein, we highlight the prevalence and prognostic, diagnostic, and predictive significance of recurrent mutations and other genomic aberrations with current clinical implications or emerging relevance to clinical practice. Some ongoing clinical trials, as well as future areas of exploration for precision oncology in BTCs are highlighted.

AB This paper uses care pathway and delay models to better understand the possible social reasons for maternal deaths in a city with good public and private health infrastructure. The findings can inform programmes to reduce maternal mortality. During 2007-15, 136 maternal deaths were reported in Chandigarh, India. Using World Health Organisation's verbal autopsy questionnaire, interviews were conducted with primary caregivers of 68 (50%) of the 136 deceased women, as majority of the families had returned to their native places. We used process-tracing techniques to construct the care pathways and identify delays, and explored open-ended responses using thematic analysis. The mean age of the deceased women was 27 years, 51% resided in slums, 32% were primigravida, 25% had their deliveries assisted by traditional birth attendants, and 23% had Caesarean section. Eight percent died at home, and 54% died in tertiary level facilities. Post-partum haemorrhage (26.5%), and complications of puerperium (25%) and labour/delivery (14.7%) were the reported medical causes. Male child preference and norms for home delivery were identified as the distal socio-cultural causes. Individual and family level factors included: shame on multiple pregnancies; fear of discrimination from providers; past successful deliveries at home leading to overconfidence and not seeking institutional care; and lack of awareness about family planning, antenatal care, and danger signs of pregnancy. Healthcare system factors were: non-availability of senior doctors at the time of consultation in the emergency that delayed initiation of immediate treatment, and lack of availability of life-saving equipment due to patient load. Empirical evidence was found on social causes of maternal deaths, which could have been prevented by appropriate actions at individual, family, societal, institutional and policy levels. This study identified potential preventable causes of primarily social origin, which could help in taking actionable steps at several levels to further reduce maternal deaths in India.

AB Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a complex and highly heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can arise all over the body, originating from neuroendocrine cells. NETs are characterized by a general lack of symptoms until they are in advanced phase, and early biomarkers are not as available and useful as required. Heterogeneity is an intrinsic, pivotal feature of NETs that derives from diverse causes and ultimately shapes tumor fate. The different layers that conform NET heterogeneity include a wide range of distinct characteristics, from the mere location of the tumor to its clinical and functional features, and from its cellular properties, to the core signaling and (epi)genetic components defining the molecular signature of the tumor. The importance of this heterogeneity resides in that it translates into a high variability among tumors and, hence, patients, which hinders a more precise diagnosis and prognosis and more efficacious treatment of these diseases. In this review, we highlight the significance of this heterogeneity as an intrinsic hallmark of NETs, its repercussion on clinical approaches and tumor management, and some of the possible factors associated to such heterogeneity, including epigenetic and genetic elements, post-transcriptional regulation, or splicing alterations. Notwithstanding, heterogeneity can also represent a valuable and actionable feature, towards improving medical approaches based on personalized medicine. We conclude that NETs can no longer be viewed as a single disease entity and that their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment must reflect and incorporate this heterogeneity.

AB CONTEXT: Assessment of social needs is expanding at Kaiser Permanente (KP), but little is known about how members and clinicians experience the incorporation of social needs into health care.; OBJECTIVE: To assess how KP members and clinicians experience social needs assessments incorporated into care.; DESIGN: Qualitative and descriptive analysis of data from member and clinician focus groups, interviews, and surveys among 68 members and family caregivers who had participated in social needs assessment programs and 90 clinicians and staff in the KP Colorado, Georgia, Northern California, Northwest, and Southern California Regions.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Members' and clinicians' perceptions and experiences of social needs assessment.; RESULTS: Members and clinicians understood the impact of social needs on health and why a health care system representative would ask about food, housing, transportation, and other social needs. Members and clinicians supported social needs assessment at KP and agreed that KP should help address identified social needs. However, both groups emphasized the importance of assessments yielding actionable information. Members were also concerned about how the information would be used and by whom.; CONCLUSION: Our findings support the continuing assessment of social needs at KP and identify issues that require attention as it expands. Assessment should not outpace organizational capacity to connect members with resources. Careful attention to communications is required because members may be uncertain or concerned about the purpose of the assessment and the dissemination of sensitive information. Messaging should assure members about data use and dissemination and what they can expect after screening.

AB Purpose: Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) from the clandestine intelligence sector are being increasingly employed in infectious disease outbreaks. The purpose of this article is to explore how such tools might be employed in the detection, reporting, and control of outbreaks designated as a 'threat' by the global community. It is also intended to analyse previous use of such tools during the Ebola and SARS epidemics and to discuss key questions regarding the ethics and legality of initiatives that further blur the military and humanitarian spaces.; Methods: We undertake qualitative analysis of current discussions on OSINT and SIGINT and their intersection with global health. We also review current literature and describe the debates. We built on quantitative and qualitative research done into current health collection capabilities.; Results: This article presents an argument for the use of OSINT in the detection of infectious disease outbreaks and how this might occur.; Conclusion: We conclude that there is a place for OSINT and SIGINT in the detection and reporting of outbreaks. However, such tools are not sufficient on their own and must be corroborated for the intelligence to be relevant and actionable. Finally, we conclude that further discussion on key ethical issues needs to take place before such research can continue. In particular, this involves questions of jurisdiction, data ownership, and ethical considerations.

AB BACKGROUND: Hereditary cancer screening (HCS) for germline variants in the 3' exons of PMS2, a mismatch repair gene implicated in Lynch syndrome, is technically challenging due to homology with its pseudogene PMS2CL. Sequences of PMS2 and PMS2CL are so similar that next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short fragments-common practice in multigene HCS panels-may identify the presence of a variant but fail to disambiguate whether its origin is the gene or the pseudogene. Molecular approaches utilizing longer DNA fragments, such as long-range PCR (LR-PCR), can definitively localize variants in PMS2, yet applying such testing to all samples can have logistical and economic drawbacks.; METHODS: To address these drawbacks, we propose and characterize a reflex workflow for variant discovery in the 3' exons of PMS2. We cataloged the natural variation in PMS2 and PMS2CL in 707 samples and designed hybrid-capture probes to enrich the gene and pseudogene with equal efficiency. For PMS2 exon 11, NGS reads were aligned, filtered using gene-specific variants, and subject to standard diploid variant calling. For PMS2 exons 12-15, the NGS reads were permissively aligned to PMS2, and variant calling was performed with the expectation of observing four alleles (i.e., tetraploid calling). In this reflex workflow, short-read NGS identifies potentially reportable variants that are then subject to disambiguation via LR-PCR-based testing.; RESULTS: Applying short-read NGS screening to 299 HCS samples and cell lines demonstrated >99% analytical sensitivity and>99% analytical specificity for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels), as well as >96% analytical sensitivity and >99% analytical specificity for copy-number variants. Importantly, 92% of samples had resolved genotypes from short-read NGS alone, with the remaining 8% requiring LR-PCR reflex.; CONCLUSION: Our reflex workflow mitigates the challenges of screening in PMS2 and serves as a guide for clinical laboratories performing multigene HCS. To facilitate future exploration and testing of PMS2 variants, we share the raw and processed LR-PCR data from commercially available cell lines, as well as variant frequencies from a diverse patient cohort.

AB INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence leads to a ratiocination that genetic heterogeneity of the lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations may impact clinical responses and outcomes to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments.; METHODS: We performed genetic profiling of pre-treatment samples of 69 lung adenocarcinoma patients, including tumor FFPE and cell-free DNA (cfDNA), targeting 416 cancer-related genes using next generation sequencing. We analyzed mutation concordance across sample types and investigated potential mechanisms that confer primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with short progression-free survival (PFS) versus those with long PFS.; RESULTS: We detected a total of 200 actionable genetic alterations (mean: 2.9 variants/patient, range: 1-7 variants) in tumor FFPE and 140 actionable genetic alterations (mean: 2.0 variants/patient, range: 0-5 variants) in matched cfDNA, respectively. All patients had EGFR TKI-sensitizing mutations, including EGFR Ex19del, L858R, G719S/C, and L861Q. Concurrent TP53 mutations were most commonly observed in 72.5% of patients, followed by EGFR amplification (20.3%), RB1 (10.1%), PIK3CA (7.2%), and MYC (5.8%). For EGFR activating mutations, the concordance rate was 88.2% between cfDNA and FFPE samples. Furthermore, we identified genes that potentially confer primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs including CDC73, SMAD4, RB1 and PIK3CA. We also report signaling pathways enriched in patients with TKI primary resistance.; CONCLUSIONS: We note the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma and underscore that mutation status is highly concordant between tumor FFPE and cfDNA samples. This study also highlights the alterations that potentially confer primary resistance to EGFR TKI treatments in patients who demonstrated short PFS. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of detecting actionable gene mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total 50 plasma samples from patients newly diagnosed with advanced NSCLC or resistant to first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were subjected to deep sequencing on a seven-gene panel (BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN) incorporated with molecular barcodes to improve accuracy in variant detection. When possible, results were compared with those from matched tissue samples.; RESULTS: At least one alteration in the ctDNA was detected in 44 out of 50 patients (88%); EGFR was the most frequently mutated gene. Half the total number of patients (50%, 25 of 50) had at least one actionable genetic alteration with targeted therapies available for treatment. Our results showed a high concordance rate of 81% in detection of EGFR mutation between 26 matched tissue and plasma samples. For progressive patients, from whom tissue is mostly unavailable, the resistant EGFR T790M mutation was validated using the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), yielding a concordance of 92% between alternative platforms.; CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that therapeutically actionable mutations can be detected with high accuracy in ctDNA using NGS. This promising approach offers alternative and non-invasive diagnostic methods for treatment guidance and clinical monitoring. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AIM: We have evaluated the pharmacogenetic content of commercial human genome-wide genotyping arrays, as it is a critical determinant to enabling pharmacogenomic discoveries.; METHODS: Using bioinformatics approaches, we assessed 27,811 genetic variants in 3146 genes for their presence in 18 Illumina and 15 Affymetrix genome-wide arrays.; RESULTS: The pharmacogenetic content of the arrays varied greatly. The combination of the Affymetrix precision medicine array and PharmacoScan arrays (Affymetrix) had the highest coverage for a set of clinically actionable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) variants, single nucleotide ADME variants and ADME insertions/deletions, with a physical coverage of 125/130 (96.2%), 9924/24,138 (41.1%) and 2252/3994 (56.4%), respectively.; CONCLUSION: The combination of the Affymetrix precision medicine array and PharmacoScan arrays provided both genome-wide and pharmacogene coverage, which is crucial in the discovering of new variants responsible for drug adverse effects. These results will help in the design of pharmacogenomic studies and will enable a critical review of results from past studies.

AB Oncogenic somatic chromosomal rearrangements involving the NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3 genes (NTRK gene fusions) occur in up to 1% of all solid tumors, and have been reported across a wide range of tumor types. The fusion proteins encoded by such rearranged sequences have constitutively activated TRK tyrosine kinase domains, providing novel therapeutic anticancer targets. The potential clinical effectiveness of TRK inhibition in patients with tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions is being assessed in phase I and II trials of TRK inhibitors, such as larotrectinib and entrectinib. Clinical trial results have demonstrated that larotrectinib is generally well tolerated and has shown high response rates that are durable across tumor types. These data validate NTRK gene fusions as actionable genomic alterations. In this review, we present the clinical data, discuss the different approaches that might be used to routinely screen tumors to indicate the presence of NTRK gene fusions, explore the issue of acquired resistance to TRK inhibition, and reflect on the wider regulatory considerations for tumor site agnostic TRK inhibitor drug development.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) mutation has distinct genomic characteristics. Introduction of systemic treatments that specifically targeted actionable EGFR mutations has changed the therapeutic paradigm in this group of patients. Moreover, newer generations of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) with superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties such as dacomitinib and osimertinib, when used in the front-line setting, have shown more favorable treatment outcomes than first-generation EGFR-TKIs. In addition, evolving molecular technologies such as droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enhanced our understanding towards the genetics and epigenetics in pathogenesis, drug-resistant mechanisms as well as improved diagnostic accuracy and efficacy. On the other hand, the recent development in immunotherapies has pushed anti-cancer treatment to new frontiers in many cancers including lung cancer. While ongoing research are focusing on how benefits of immunotherapy can be potentiated, the combinational use of EGFR-TKIs and checkpoint inhibitors have been shown repeatedly in prior trials to cause significant toxicities. This approach cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial at this time. Overall, remarkable progresses have opened new therapeutic strategies with which patient survival is further improved. In this review, we shall discuss the latest treatment strategies in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC with a focus on latest evidence, and how advances in molecular diagnostics can play an important role patient management.

AB High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has demonstrated capabilities for broad virus detection based upon discovery of known and novel viruses in a variety of samples, including clinical, environmental, and biological. An important goal for HTS applications in biologics is to establish parameter settings that can afford adequate sensitivity at an acceptable computational cost (computation time, computer memory, storage, expense or/and efficiency), at critical steps in the bioinformatics pipeline, including initial data quality assessment, trimming/cleaning, and assembly (to reduce data volume and increase likelihood of appropriate sequence identification). Additionally, the quality and reliability of the results depend on the availability of a complete and curated viral database for obtaining accurate results; selection of sequence alignment programs and their configuration, that retains specificity for broad virus detection with reduced false-positive signals; removal of host sequences without loss of endogenous viral sequences of interest; and use of a meaningful reporting format, which can retain critical information of the analysis for presentation of readily interpretable data and actionable results. Furthermore, after alignment, both automated and manual evaluation may be needed to verify the results and help assign a potential risk level to residual, unmapped reads. We hope that the collective considerations discussed in this paper aid toward optimization of data analysis pipelines for virus detection by HTS.

AB Despite the advances in cancer immunotherapy, only a fraction of patients with bladder cancer exhibit responses to checkpoint blockade, highlighting a need to better understand drug resistance and identify rational immunotherapy combinations. However, accessibility to the tumor prior and during therapy is a major limitation in understanding the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, we identified urine-derived lymphocytes (UDLs) as a readily accessible source of T cells in 32 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). We observed that effector CD8+ and CD4+ cells and regulatory T cells within the urine accurately map the immune checkpoint landscape and T cell receptor repertoire of the TME. Finally, an increased UDL count, specifically high expression of PD-1 (PD-1hi) on CD8+ at the time of cystectomy, was associated with a shorter recurrence-free survival. UDL analysis represents a dynamic liquid biopsy that is representative of the bladder immune TME that may be used to identify actionable immuno-oncology (IO) targets with potential prognostic value in MIBC. © 2018 Wong et al.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore concept mapping (CM) as a participatory methodology that can be used by public health officials to strategize approaches to reducing health inequities among low wage workers and workers with unstable employment.; METHODS: In a workshop of 68 occupational health officers, mainly from government agencies, CM was demonstrated through gathering and prioritizing ideas for reaching underserved, at-risk working populations.; RESULTS: Prior to the workshop, occupational health officers generated 99 brainstormed ideas on how to reach underserved workers. These were reduced to 39 unique items, which workshop participants then sorted into themes and prioritized based on perceived effectiveness and feasibility. Twelve specific approaches covering enhanced surveillance methods, occupational safety and health (OSH) training, and partnering with employers, other agencies, and community groups were considered most actionable by occupational/public health officers to address the health of low-wage, and precarious workers. In a follow-up session 1 year later, a subset of participants discussed the findings.; CONCLUSION: Concept mapping can be used to elucidate actionable approaches by government agencies to better address occupational health inequities experienced by low wage and precarious workers.

AB Small-holding farmers in the developing world suffer from sub-optimal crop yields because they lack a soil diagnostic system that is affordable, usable, and actionable. This paper details the fabrication and characterization of an integrated point-of-use soil-testing system, comprised of disposable ion-selective electrode strips and a handheld electrochemical reader. Together, the strips and reader transduce soil ion concentrations into to an alphanumeric output that can be communicated via text message to a central service provider offering immediate, customized fertilizer advisory. The solid-state ion-selective electrode (SS-ISE) strips employ a two-electrode design with screen-printable carbon nanotube ink serving as the electrical contacts for the working and reference electrodes. The working electrode comprises a plasticizer-free butyl acrylate ion-selective membrane (ISM), doped with an ion-selective ionophore and lipophilic salt. Meanwhile, the reference electrode includes a screen-printed silver-silver chloride ink and a polyvinyl-butyral membrane, which is doped with sodium chloride for stable reference potentials. As a proof of concept, potassium-selective electrodes are studied, given potassium's essential role in plant growth and reproduction. The ISE-based system is reproducibly manufactured to yield a Nernstian response with a sub-micromolar detection limit (pK+ of 5.18 ± 0.08) and near-Nernstian sensitivity (61 mV/decade) in the presence of a 0.02 M strontium chloride extraction solution. Analysis of soil samples using the printed electrodes and reader yielded a correlation coefficient of 𝑅2 = 0.89 with respect to values measured via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The reliable performance of this system is encouraging toward its deployment for soil nutrient management in resource-limited environments.

AB The recent developments in anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory drugs show that the tumour micro-environment (TME) becomes increasingly important in cancer research. Here we investigated the correlation between the Gleason score (GS) and the TME by comparing tissue expression profiles of steroid hormone receptors, cancer activated fibroblast (CAF) markers and vessel densities between different GS groups. Therefore, matched patient cohorts were composed for different GS (6-7-8). Tissue micro-arrays with 6 samples/patient were processed for immunohistochemistry. Stained slides were digitised, stroma and epithelium were selectively annotated, and all selected areas were quantitatively analysed for marker expression. The most striking findings were decreased stromal expression levels of several steroid hormone receptors, increased CAF-phenotypes and increased vessel densities in high GS prostate cancer compared to low GS prostate cancer and paired prostate non-tumour tissue. The present data reveal a complex correlation between prostate cancer differentiation and TME components and suggest that different GS can be associated with different possible actionable targets in the TME. The use of standardised digital image analysis tools generated robust and reproducible quantitative data, which is novel and more informative compared to the classic semi-quantitative and observer-dependent visual scoring of immunohistochemistry.

AB OBJECTIVES: Multi-analyte assays with algorithmic analyses (MAAAs) use combinations of circulating and clinical markers including omics-based sources for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes. Assessing MAAAs is challenging under existing health technology assessment (HTA) methods or practices. We undertook a scoping review to explore the HTA methods used for MAAAs to identify the criteria used for clinical research and reimbursement purposes.; METHODS: This review included only non-companion (stand-alone) tests that are actionable and that have been evaluated by leading HTA or insurer/reimbursement bodies up to September 2017.; RESULTS: Twenty-five reports and articles evaluating seventeen MAAAs were examined, most of which have been developed in oncology. The two main models used were the EUnetHTA Core model and the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention ACCE framework. Clinical validity and utility criteria were used, as were economic, ethical, legal, and social aspects. Economic evidence on MAAAs was scarce, and there is no consensus on whether the perspectives used are sufficiently broad to include all relevant stakeholders.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinical utility and efficiency were the most used criteria, with stronger evidence needed linking the use of the algorithm with the clinical outcomes in real-life practice. HTA bodies must as well consider questions related to the analytical validity of MAAAs or with organizational aspects. The two main models, the EUnetHTA Core model and the ACCE framework, could be adapted to the assessment of MAAAs.

AB 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) is the most frequent copy number variant (CNV) affecting ~1/1,000 fetuses and ~1/2,000-4,000 children, resulting in recognizable but variable findings across multiple organ systems. Patients with atypical features should prompt consideration of coexisting diagnoses due to additional genome-wide mutations, CNVs, or mutations/CNVs on the other allele, unmasking autosomal recessive conditions. Importantly, a dual diagnosis compounds symptoms and impacts management. We previously reported seven patients with 22q11.2DS and: SCID, Trisomy 8 mosaicism, Bernard-Soulier, and CEDNIK syndromes. Here we present six additional unreported patients with 22q11.2DS and concurrent diagnoses. Records on 1,422 patients with 22q11.2DS, identified via FISH, microarray, or MLPA, followed in our 22q and You Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) were reviewed to identify a dual diagnosis. In addition to our seven previously reported cases, we identified an additional six with 22q11.2DS and another coexisting condition identified via: molecular/cytogenetic studies, newborn screening, coagulation factor studies, or enzyme testing; these include CHARGE syndrome (CHD7 mutation), cystic fibrosis, a maternally inherited 17q12 deletion, G6PD deficiency, von Willebrand disease, and 1q21.1 deletion, resulting in an incidence of dual diagnoses at our center of 0.9%. The range of dual diagnoses identified in our cohort is notable, medically actionable, and may alter long-term outcome and recurrence risk counseling. Thus, our findings may support testing patients with 22q11.2DS using a combination of microarray, mutational analysis of the other allele/WES, to ensure appropriate personalized care, as formulating medical management decisions hinges on establishing the correct diagnoses in their entirety. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hotspot mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (R132) or 2 (R172) genes affect 40% of diffuse gliomas, mostly grades II and III. The mutant enzyme produces high quantities of d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), which reshapes the epigenetic of the cell leading to gliomagenesis. For the clinician, the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is a major biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive consequences. With the development of specific inhibitors and vaccination, it appears also a potential actionable target.; RECENT FINDINGS: IDH status is routinely determined on tumor sample by sequencing and immunohistochemistry detecting the most common mutant protein (IDH1R132H). Recently noninvasive diagnostic approaches have been developed based on the detection of the mutant DNA or the D2HG in body fluids, and the detection of D2HG by magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain.; SUMMARY: These new techniques open avenues for non invasive diagnostic of glioma in patients not amenable to biopsy, in the preoperative setting and also duringpatients follow-up for evaluation of treatment response and prediction of recurrence.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current digital technologies are being used for "actionable adherence monitoring"; that is, technologies that can be used to identify episodes of non-adherence to ART in a timely manner such that tailored interventions based on adherence data can be provided when and where they are needed most.; RECENT FINDINGS: Current digital communication technologies used to monitor ART adherence include electronic adherence monitors (EAMs), digital ingestion monitors, cellular phones, and electronic pharmacy refill tracking systems. Currently available real-time adherence monitoring approaches based on cellular technology allow for the delivery of interventions precisely when and where they are needed. Such technology can potentially enable significant efficiency of care delivery and impact on adherence and associated clinical outcomes. Standard digital advances, such as automated reminders in EAM and electronic pharmacy records, may also achieve improvements with relatively lower cost and easier implementation. Future research is needed to improve the functionality of these approaches, with attention paid to system-level issues through implementation science, as well as acceptability and ethical considerations at the individual level.

AB Regulatory agencies have long adopted a three-tier framework for risk assessment. We build on this structure to propose a tiered approach for resilience assessment that can be integrated into the existing regulatory processes. Comprehensive approaches to assessing resilience at appropriate and operational scales, reconciling analytical complexity as needed with stakeholder needs and resources available, and ultimately creating actionable recommendations to enhance resilience are still lacking. Our proposed framework consists of tiers by which analysts can select resilience assessment and decision support tools to inform associated management actions relative to the scope and urgency of the risk and the capacity of resource managers to improve system resilience. The resilience management framework proposed is not intended to supplant either risk management or the many existing efforts of resilience quantification method development, but instead provide a guide to selecting tools that are appropriate for the given analytic need. The goal of this tiered approach is to intentionally parallel the tiered approach used in regulatory contexts so that resilience assessment might be more easily and quickly integrated into existing structures and with existing policies.

AB Background: Frequently occurring in cancer are the aberrant alterations of regulatory onco-metabolites, various oncogenes/epigenetic stochasticity, and suppressor genes, as well as the deficient mismatch repair mechanism, chronic inflammation, or those deviations belonging to the other cancer characteristics. How these aberrations that evolve overtime determine the global phenotype of malignant tumors remains to be completely understood. Dynamic analysis may have potential to reveal the mechanism of carcinogenesis and can offer new therapeutic intervention.; Aims: We introduce simplified mathematical tools to model serial quantitative data of cancer biomarkers. We also highlight an introductory overview of mathematical tools and models as they apply from the viewpoint of known cancer features.; Methods: Mathematical modeling of potentially actionable genomic products and how they proceed overtime during tumorigenesis are explored. This report is intended to be instinctive without being overly technical.; Results: To date, many mathematical models of the common features of cancer have been developed. However, the dynamic of integrated heterogeneous processes and their cross talks related to carcinogenesis remains to be resolved.; Conclusions: In cancer research, outlining mathematical modeling of experimentally obtained data snapshots of molecular species may provide insights into a better understanding of the multiple biochemical circuits. Recent discoveries have provided support for the existence of complex cancer progression in dynamics that span from a simple 1-dimensional deterministic system to a stochastic (ie, probabilistic) or to an oscillatory and multistable networks. Further research in mathematical modeling of cancer progression, based on the evolving molecular kinetics (time series), could inform a specific and a predictive behavior about the global systems biology of vulnerable tumor cells in their earlier stages of oncogenesis. On this footing, new preventive measures and anticancer therapy could then be constructed.

AB Background: Flow cytometry, with its high throughput nature, combined with the ability to measure an increasing number of cell parameters at once can surpass the throughput of prevalent genomic and metagenomic approaches in the study of microbiomes. Novel computational approaches to analyze flow cytometry data will result in greater insights and actionability as compared to traditional tools used in the analysis of microbiomes. This paper is a demonstration of the fruitfulness of machine learning in analyzing microbial flow cytometry data generated in anaerobic microbiome perturbation experiments.; Results: Autoencoders were found to be powerful in detecting anomalies in flow cytometry data from nanoparticles and carbon sources perturbed anaerobic microbiomes but was marginal in predicting perturbations due to antibiotics. A comparison between different algorithms based on predictive capabilities suggested that gradient boosting (GB) and deep learning, i.e. feed forward artificial neural network with three hidden layers (DL) were marginally better under tested conditions at predicting overall community structure while distributed random forests (DRF) worked better for predicting the most important putative microbial group(s) in the anaerobic digesters viz. methanogens, and it can be optimized with better parameter tuning. Predictive classification patterns with DL (feed forward artificial neural network with three hidden layers) were found to be comparable to previously demonstrated multivariate analysis. The potential applications of this approach have been demonstrated for monitoring the syntrophic resilience of the anaerobic microbiomes perturbed by synthetic nanoparticles as well as antibiotics.; Conclusion: Machine learning can benefit the microbial flow cytometry research community by providing rapid screening and characterization tools to discover patterns in the dynamic response of microbiomes to several stimuli.

AB Lung cancer is associated with high prevalence and mortality, and despite significant successes with targeted drugs in genomically defined subsets of lung cancer and immunotherapy, the majority of patients currently does not benefit from these therapies. Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDPK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin's cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be used for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation. © 2018 Ctortecka et al.

AB There are multiple applications of molecular tests in clinical oncology. Mutation analysis is now routinely utilized for the diagnosis of hereditary cancer syndromes. Healthy carriers of cancer-predisposing mutations benefit from tight medical surveillance and various preventive interventions. Cancers caused by germ-line mutations often require significant modification of the treatment strategy. Personalized selection of cancer drugs based on the presence of actionable mutations has become an integral part of cancer therapy. Molecular tests underlie the administration of EGFR, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, PARP inhibitors as well as the use of some other cytotoxic and targeted drugs. Tumors almost always shed their fragments (single cells or their clusters, DNA, RNA, proteins) into various body fluids. So-called liquid biopsy, i.e., the analysis of circulating DNA or some other tumor-derived molecules, holds a great promise for non-invasive monitoring of cancer disease, analysis of drug-sensitizing mutations and early cancer detection. Some tumor- or tissue-specific mutations and expression markers can be efficiently utilized for the diagnosis of cancers of unknown primary origin (CUPs). Systematic cataloging of tumor molecular portraits is likely to uncover a multitude of novel medically relevant DNA- and RNA-based markers.

AB Precision medicine holds real promise for the treatment of cancer. Adapting therapeutic strategies so patients receive individualized treatment protocols, will transform how diseases like cancer are managed. Already, molecular profiling technologies have provided unprecedented capacity to characterize tumors, yet the ability to translate this to actionable outcome in the clinic is limited. To enable real time translation of personalized therapeutic approaches to patient care in a co-clinical manner will require the adoption and integration of approaches that facilitate modeling of patient disease. The Mouse Hospital represents an approach that is ideally suited to pre- and co-clinical evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies for clinical care. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) technologies and in situ tumor modeling approaches using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) already have a proven capacity to mimic human tumor responses, and their application can deliver invaluable insights into appropriate clinical approaches for individual patients by mirroring human clinical trials using a Co-Clinical Trial project and Mouse Hospital infrastructure.

AB Germline genomic testing is increasingly used in research to identify genetic causes of disease, including cancer. However, there is evidence that individuals who are notified of clinically actionable research findings have difficulty making informed decisions regarding uptake of genetic counseling for these findings. This study aimed to produce and pilot test a decision aid to assist participants in genomic research studies who are notified of clinically actionable research findings to make informed choices regarding uptake of genetic counseling. Development was guided by published literature, the International Patient Decision Aid Standards, and the expertise of a steering committee of clinicians, researchers, and consumers. Decision aid acceptability was assessed by self-report questionnaire. All 19 participants stated that the decision aid was easy to read, clearly presented, increased their understanding of the implications of taking up research findings, and would be helpful in decision-making. While low to moderate levels of distress/worry were reported after reading the booklet, a majority of participants also reported feeling reassured. All participants would recommend the booklet to others considering uptake of clinically actionable research findings. Results indicate the decision aid is acceptable to the target audience, with potential as a useful decision support tool for genomic research participants.

AB Variants of uncertain significance fundamentally limit the clinical utility of genetic information. The challenge they pose is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumour suppressor genein which germline loss-of-function variants predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Here we use saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Functional effects for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Over 400 non-functional missense SNVs are identified, as well as around 300 SNVs that disrupt expression. We predict that these results will be immediately useful for the clinical interpretation of BRCA1 variants, and that this approach can be extended to overcome the challenge of variants of uncertain significance in additional clinically actionable genes.

AB BACKGROUND: Broadcast direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription drug ads that present product claims are required to also present the product's major risks. Debate exists regarding how much information should be included in these major risk statements. Some argue that such statements expose people to unnecessary amounts of information, while others argue that they leave out important information.; OBJECTIVES: Examine the impact of type of risk statement (unedited versus serious and actionable risks only) and a disclosure indicating that not all risks are presented on consumers' ability to remember the important risks and benefits of a drug following exposure to a DTC television advertisement (ad). Risk and benefit perceptions, ad-prompted actions, recognition of the disclosure statement, and evaluations of both the disclosure and risk statement were also examined.; METHODS: A web-based experiment was conducted in which US adults who self-reported as having depression (N=500), insomnia (N=500), or high cholesterol (N=500) were randomly assigned to view one of four versions of the television ad, and then complete a questionnaire.; RESULTS: The type of risk statement had a significant effect on risk recall and recognition, benefit recognition, perceived risk severity (depression condition only), and perceived benefit magnitude (high cholesterol condition only). Disclosure recognition (using bias-corrected scores) ranged from 63% to 70% across the three illness samples.; CONCLUSIONS: The revised risk statement improved overall processing of the television ad, as evidenced by improved risk recall and recognition and improved benefit recognition. Further, the presence of the disclosure did not adversely affect consumers' processing of drug risk and benefit information. Therefore, limiting the risks presented in DTC television ads and including a disclosure alerting consumers that not all risks are presented may be an effective strategy for communicating product risks.

AB BACKGROUND: Occurrence at a younger age has been demonstrated to be associated with a distinct biology in non-small cell lung cancer. However, genomics and clinical characteristics among younger patients with lung adenocarcinoma remain to be determined. Here we studied the potentially targetable genetic alterations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay in young Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-one surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples from patients aged less than 45 years were collected with informed consent from all patients. Targeted NGS assays were used to identify actionable genetic alterations in the cancer tissues. Additionally, the genomic and clinicopathologic characteristics of 106 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who received NGS testing over the same period were analyzed retrospectively.; RESULTS: The frequencies of targetable genetic alterations in 177 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by defined age categories, which unveiled a distinctive molecular profile in the younger group, aged less than 45 years. Notably, higher frequency of ALK and HER2 genetic alterations were associated with young age. However, a reverse trend was observed for KRAS, STK11 and EGFR exon 20 mutations, which were more frequently identified in the older group, aged more than 46 years. Furthermore, concurrent EGFR/TP53 mutations were much more prevalent in the younger patients (81.6% vs. 46.8%), which might have a poor response to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.; CONCLUSION: In this study, NGS assay revealed a distinctive genetic profile in younger patients with adenocarcinoma. High frequency of concurrent EGFR/TP53 mutations was found in the younger patients, which especially warranted personalized treatment in this population.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Further investigation is needed to understand the genomics and clinical characteristics of young patients with lung adenocarcinoma. In the present study, hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing assays were used to identify targeted genetic alterations in young lung adenocarcinoma patients. Young patients with lung adenocarcinoma, aged less than 45 years, harbored a higher frequency of ALK and HER2 genetic alterations compared with patients aged more than 46 years. Dramatically, concurrent EGFR/TP53 mutations were much more prevalent in younger patients, which had a poor response to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor. These results reveal a distinctive genetic profile in younger patients with adenocarcinoma, which might improve the treatment of this subpopulation. © AlphaMed Press 2018.

AB Patients with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) have few therapeutic options. Despite lack of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) driver mutations, SDH-deficient GISTs display strong expression of KIT by immunohistochemistry and these patients are often treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib as a first-line therapy. Using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel of mutation hotspots of 50-clinically relevant genes, we investigated (1) concurrence of somatic/actionable mutations and (2) tumor molecular evolution by comparing 2 resection specimens 1.5 years apart while the patient was on imatinib adjuvant therapy. We found the tumors did not harbor KIT, PDGFRA, or any other clinically actionable mutations. However, a TP53 mutation (c.422G>A; p.C141Y) was detected in the second recurrent lesion. This represents the first study to monitor the molecular evolution of a SDH-deficient GIST during adjuvant treatment. These findings emphasize the critical need for next-generation sequencing testing before initiating targeted therapy.

AB INTRODUCTION: Mental ill-health is prevalent across all groups of health professionals and this is of great concern in many countries. In the UK, the mental health of the National Health Service (NHS) workforce is a major healthcare issue, leading to presenteeism, absenteeism and loss of staff from the workforce. Most interventions targeting doctors aim to increase their 'productivity' and 'resilience', placing responsibility for good mental health with doctors themselves and neglecting the organisational and structural contexts that may have a detrimental effect on doctors' well-being. There is a need for approaches that are sensitive to the contextual complexities of mental ill-health in doctors, and that do not treat doctors as a uniform body, but allow distinctions to account for particular characteristics, such as specialty, career stage and different working environments.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our project aims to understand how, why and in what contexts support interventions can be designed to minimise the incidence of doctors' mental ill-health. We will conduct a realist review-a form of theory-driven interpretative systematic review-of interventions, drawing on diverse literature sources. The review will iteratively progress through five steps: (1) locate existing theories; (2) search for evidence; (3) select articles; (4) extract and organise data and (5) synthesise evidence and draw conclusions. The analysis will summarise how, why and in what circumstances doctors' mental ill-health is likely to develop and what can remediate the situation. Throughout the project, we will also engage iteratively with diverse stakeholders in order to produce actionable theory.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for our review. Our dissemination strategy will be participatory. Tailored outputs will be targeted to: policy makers; NHS employers and healthcare leaders; team leaders; support organisations; doctors experiencing mental ill-health, their families and colleagues.; PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017069870. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects half the US population over the age of 85 and is universally fatal following an average course of 10 years of progressive cognitive disability. Genetic and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified about 33 risk factor genes for common, late-onset AD (LOAD), but these risk loci fail to account for the majority of affected cases and can neither provide clinically meaningful prediction of development of AD nor offer actionable mechanisms. This cohort study generated large-scale matched multi-Omics data in AD and control brains for exploring novel molecular underpinnings of AD. Specifically, we generated whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and proteome profiling data from multiple regions of 364 postmortem control, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and AD brains with rich clinical and pathophysiological data. All the data went through rigorous quality control. Both the raw and processed data are publicly available through the Synapse software platform.

AB Importance: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, in children is a rapidly growing public health concern because epidemiologic data indicate a marked increase in the number of emergency department visits for mTBI over the past decade. However, no evidence-based clinical guidelines have been developed to date for diagnosing and managing pediatric mTBI in the United States.; Objective: To provide a guideline based on a previous systematic review of the literature to obtain and assess evidence toward developing clinical recommendations for health care professionals related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and management/treatment of pediatric mTBI.; Evidence Review: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Board of Scientific Counselors, a federal advisory committee, established the Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Guideline Workgroup. The workgroup drafted recommendations based on the evidence that was obtained and assessed within the systematic review, as well as related evidence, scientific principles, and expert inference. This information includes selected studies published since the evidence review was conducted that were deemed by the workgroup to be relevant to the recommendations. The dates of the initial literature search were January 1, 1990, to November 30, 2012, and the dates of the updated literature search were December 1, 2012, to July 31, 2015.; Findings: The CDC guideline includes 19 sets of recommendations on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management/treatment of pediatric mTBI that were assigned a level of obligation (ie, must, should, or may) based on confidence in the evidence. Recommendations address imaging, symptom scales, cognitive testing, and standardized assessment for diagnosis; history and risk factor assessment, monitoring, and counseling for prognosis; and patient/family education, rest, support, return to school, and symptom management for treatment.; Conclusions and Relevance: This guideline identifies the best practices for mTBI based on the current evidence; updates should be made as the body of evidence grows. In addition to the development of the guideline, CDC has created user-friendly guideline implementation materials that are concise and actionable. Evaluation of the guideline and implementation materials is crucial in understanding the influence of the recommendations.

AB OBJECTIVE: Health information technology could provide valuable support for inter-professional collaboration to address complex health issues, but current HIT systems do not adequately support such collaboration. Existing theoretical research on supporting collaborative work can help inform the design of collaborative HIT systems. Using the example of supporting collaboration between child development service providers, we describe a deductive approach that leverages concepts from the literature and analyzes qualitative user-needs data to aid in collaborative system design.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use the Collaboration Space Model to guide the deductive qualitative analysis of interviews focused on the use of information technology to support child development. We deductively analyzed 44 interviews from two separate research initiatives and included data from a wide range of stakeholder groups including parents and various service providers. We summarized the deductively coded interview excerpts using quantitative and qualitative methods.; RESULTS: The deductive analysis method provided a rich set of design data, highlighting heterogeneity in work processes, barriers to adequate communication, and gaps in stakeholder knowledge in supporting child development work.; DISCUSSION: Deductive qualitative analysis considering constructs from a literature-based model provided useful, actionable data to aid in design. Design implications underscore functions needed to adequately share data across many stakeholders. More work is needed to validate our design implications and to better understand the situations where specific system features would be most useful.; CONCLUSIONS: Deductive analysis considering model constructs provides a useful approach to designing collaborative HIT systems, allowing designers to consider both empirical user data and existing knowledge from the literature. This method has the potential to improve designs for collaborative HIT systems. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Canine malignant melanoma, a significant cause of mortality in domestic dogs, is a powerful comparative model for human melanoma, but little is known about its genetic etiology. We mapped the genomic landscape of canine melanoma through multi-platform analysis of 37 tumors (31 mucosal, 3 acral, 2 cutaneous, and 1 uveal) and 17 matching constitutional samples including long- and short-insert whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism array, and targeted Sanger sequencing analyses. We identified novel predominantly truncating mutations in the putative tumor suppressor gene PTPRJ in 19% of cases. No BRAF mutations were detected, but activating RAS mutations (24% of cases) occurred in conserved hotspots in all cutaneous and acral and 13% of mucosal subtypes. MDM2 amplifications (24%) and TP53 mutations (19%) were mutually exclusive. Additional low-frequency recurrent alterations were observed amidst low point mutation rates, an absence of ultraviolet light mutational signatures, and an abundance of copy number and structural alterations. Mutations that modulate cell proliferation and cell cycle control were common and highlight therapeutic axes such as MEK and MDM2 inhibition. This mutational landscape resembles that seen in BRAF wild-type and sun-shielded human melanoma subtypes. Overall, these data inform biological comparisons between canine and human melanoma while suggesting actionable targets in both species.

AB OBJECTIVE: We explored both within-method and between-method rigor and reproducibility in the field of eating disorders genetics.; METHOD: We present critical evaluation and commentary on component methods of genetic research (family studies, twin studies, molecular genetic studies) and discuss both successful and unsuccessful efforts in the field.; RESULTS: Eating disorders genetics has had a number of robust results that converge across component methodologies. Familial aggregation of eating disorders, twin-based heritability estimates of eating disorders, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) all point toward a substantial role for genetics in eating disorders etiology and support the premise that genes do not act alone. Candidate gene and linkage studies have been less informative historically.; DISCUSSION: The eating disorders field has entered the GWAS era with studies of anorexia nervosa. Continued growth of sample sizes is essential for rigorous discovery of actionable variation. Molecular genetic studies of bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and other eating disorders are virtually nonexistent and lag seriously behind other major psychiatric disorders. Expanded efforts are necessary to reveal the fundamental biology of eating disorders, inform clinical practice, and deliver new therapeutic targets. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Variability in the accuracy of somatic mutation detection may affect the discovery of alterations and the therapeutic management of cancer patients. To address this issue, we developed a somatic mutation discovery approach based on machine learning that outperformed existing methods in identifying experimentally validated tumor alterations (sensitivity of 97% versus 90 to 99%; positive predictive value of 98% versus 34 to 92%). Analysis of paired tumor-normal exome data from 1368 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) samples using this method revealed concordance for 74% of mutation calls but also identified likely false-positive and false-negative changes in TCGA data, including in clinically actionable genes. Determination of high-quality somatic mutation calls improved tumor mutation load-based predictions of clinical outcome for melanoma and lung cancer patients previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Integration of high-quality machine learning mutation detection in clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses increased the accuracy of test results compared to other clinical sequencing analyses. These analyses provide an approach for improved identification of tumor-specific mutations and have important implications for research and clinical management of cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Conversational assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are ubiquitous and are beginning to be used as portals for medical services. However, the potential safety issues of using conversational assistants for medical information by patients and consumers are not understood.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and nature of the harm that could result from patients or consumers using conversational assistants for medical information.; METHODS: Participants were given medical problems to pose to Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, and asked to determine an action to take based on information from the system. Assignment of tasks and systems were randomized across participants, and participants queried the conversational assistants in their own words, making as many attempts as needed until they either reported an action to take or gave up. Participant-reported actions for each medical task were rated for patient harm using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality harm scale.; RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects completed the study with a mean age of 42 years (SD 18). Twenty-nine (54%) were female, 31 (57%) Caucasian, and 26 (50%) were college educated. Only 8 (15%) reported using a conversational assistant regularly, while 22 (41%) had never used one, and 24 (44%) had tried one "a few times." Forty-four (82%) used computers regularly. Subjects were only able to complete 168 (43%) of their 394 tasks. Of these, 49 (29%) reported actions that could have resulted in some degree of patient harm, including 27 (16%) that could have resulted in death.; CONCLUSIONS: Reliance on conversational assistants for actionable medical information represents a safety risk for patients and consumers. Patients should be cautioned to not use these technologies for answers to medical questions they intend to act on without further consultation from a health care provider. ©Timothy W.

AB BACKGROUND: Quality improvement efforts in sepsis management have increased patients' survival rates. Many sepsis survivors experience sequelae leading to unplanned hospital readmissions and subsequent mortality, especially when survivors delay seeking medical attention because they do not recognize the signs and symptoms of recurrent sepsis. Thus, increasing knowledge of sepsis among patients and caregivers before initial hospital discharge is essential.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the understandability and actionability of a printable patient education tool on sepsis.; METHODS: Ten sepsis experts were invited to evaluate and score the content of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sepsis Fact Sheet for understandability and actionability using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for printable material. Data were collected on 24 items via an electronic survey. Descriptive analysis included overall and understandability and actionability scores and measurement of interrater reliability. Items with discrepancies were reviewed.; RESULTS: Nine experts responded to the survey. Mean understandability (80.74), actionability (90.74), and overall (83.33) scores support the tool's utility for patient education. Interrater reliability found fair-to-moderate agreement across survey items.; CONCLUSIONS: The Sepsis Fact Sheet provides useful patient information as evaluated using established recommendations for printed materials and expert content validation. Areas for improvement include providing a summary, modifying images, and simplifying language. Results may be useful for sepsis education and discharge teaching. ©2018 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

AB Background: MET exon 14 alterations are actionable oncogenic drivers. Durable responses to MET inhibitors are observed in patients with advanced MET exon 14-altered lung cancers in prospective trials. In contrast, the activity of immunotherapy, PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) of these tumors and are not well characterized.; Patients and methods: Patients with MET exon 14-altered lung cancers of any stage treated at two academic institutions were identified. A review of clinicopathologic and molecular features, and an analysis of response to single-agent or combination immune checkpoint inhibition were conducted. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry was carried out and TMB was calculated by estimation from targeted next-generation sequencing panels.; Results: We identified 147 patients with MET exon 14-altered lung cancers. PD-L1 expression of 0%, 1%-49%, and ≥50% were 37%, 22%, and 41%, respectively, in 111 evaluable tumor samples. The median TMB of MET exon 14-altered lung cancers was lower than that of unselected non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in both independently evaluated cohorts: 3.8 versus 5.7 mutations/megabase (P<0.001, n=78 versus 1769, cohort A), and 7.3 versus 11.8 mutations/megabase (P<0.001, n=62 versus 1100, cohort B). There was no association between PD-L1 expression and TMB (Spearman's rho=0.18, P=0.069). In response-evaluable patients (n=24), the objective response rate was 17% (95% CI 6% to 36%) and the median progression-free survival was 1.9months (95% CI 1.7-2.7). Responses were not enriched in tumors with PD-L1 expression ≥50% nor high TMB.; Conclusion: A substantial proportion of MET exon 14-altered lung cancers express PD-L1, but the median TMB is lower compared with unselected NSCLCs. Occasional responses to PD-1 blockade can be achieved, but overall clinical efficacy is modest.

AB PURPOSE: Gliomas, a genetically heterogeneous group of primary central nervous system tumors, continue to pose a significant clinical challenge. Discovery of chromosomal rearrangements involving kinase genes has enabled precision therapy, and improved outcomes in several malignancies.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Positing that similar benefit could be accomplished for patients with brain cancer, we evaluated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma dataset. Functional validation of the oncogenic potential and inhibitory sensitivity of discovered ROS1 fusions was performed using three independent cell-based model systems, and an in vivo murine xenograft study.; RESULTS: In silico analysis revealed previously unreported intrachromosomal 6q22 microdeletions that generate ROS1-fusions from TCGA glioblastoma dataset. ROS1 fusions in primary glioma and ependymoma were independently corroborated from MSK-IMPACT and Foundation Medicine clinical datasets. GOPC-ROS1 is a recurrent ROS1 fusion in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. CEP85L-ROS1 and GOPC-ROS1 are transforming oncogenes in cells of astrocytic lineage, and amenable to pharmacologic inhibition with several ROS1 inhibitors even when occurring concurrently with other cancer hotspot aberrations frequently associated with glioblastoma. Oral monotherapy with a brain-permeable ROS1 inhibitor, lorlatinib, significantly prolonged survival in an intracranially xenografted tumor model generated from a ROS1 fusion-positive glioblastoma cell line.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that CNS tumors should be specifically interrogated for these rare intrachromosomal 6q22 microdeletion events that generate actionable ROS1 fusions. ROS1 fusions in primary brain cancer may be amenable for clinical intervention with kinase inhibitors, and this holds the potential of novel treatment paradigms in these treatment-refractory cancer types, particularly in glioblastoma. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine was first reported to lower daily insulin dose and improve glycemic control in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 1984. While renal toxicity limited cyclosporine's extended use, this observation ignited collaborative efforts to identify immunotherapeutic agents capable of safely preserving beta cells in patients with or at risk for T1D.; RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in T1D prediction and early diagnosis, together with expanded knowledge of the disease mechanisms, have facilitated trials targeting specific immune cell subsets, autoantigens, and pathways. In addition, clinical responder and non-responder subsets have been defined through the use of metabolic and immunological readouts. Herein, we review emerging T1D biomarkers within the context of recent and ongoing T1D immunotherapy trials. We also discuss responder/non-responder analyses in an effort to identify therapeutic mechanisms, define actionable pathways, and guide subject selection, drug dosing, and tailored combination drug therapy for future T1D trials.

AB The adoption of enterprise digital imaging, along with the development of quantitative imaging methods and the re-emergence of statistical learning, has opened the opportunity for more personalized cancer treatments through transformative data science research. In the last 5years, accumulating evidence has indicated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics (i.e., radiomics) can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple lesions at multiple time points over the course of treatment. Many groups using homegrown software have extracted engineered and deep quantitative features on 3-dimensional medical images for better spatial and longitudinal understanding of tumor biology and for the prediction of diverse outcomes. These developments could augment patient stratification and prognostication, buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately, the rapid growth in popularity of this immature scientific discipline has resulted in many early publications that miss key information or use underpowered patient data sets, without production of generalizable results. Quantitative imaging research is complex, and key principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The fields of quantitative imaging and radiomics in particular require a renewed focus on optimal study design and reporting practices, standardization, interpretability, data sharing, and clinical trials. Standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and statistical analysis (i.e., machine learning) are required for the field to move forward. A new data-sharing paradigm enacted among open and diverse participants (medical institutions, vendors and associations) should be embraced for faster development and comprehensive clinical validation of imaging biomarkers. In this review and critique of the field, we propose working principles and fundamental changes to the current scientific approach, with the goal of high-impact research and development of actionable prediction models that will yield more meaningful applications of precision cancer medicine.

AB Aedes-vectored viruses are a major concern for active-duty military personnel working in South and Central America at certain times of the year. Knowledge about the seasonal changes of vector activity is important as it informs time-sensitive vector control, prophylaxis, and travel decisions. To assist in-country and extralimital efforts to anticipate when vector hazards and the risks of transmission are highest, we developed an Excel spreadsheet tool that uses published monthly habitat suitability models to display various aspects of average Aedes seasonality for user-defined second order administrative areas of Brazil. This tool expands on those previously developed by the authors for the contiguous United States, with the aim of translating global habitat suitability models into user-friendly formats to provide actionable intelligence for areas of interest.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) joined the Choosing Wisely campaign in 2013 and has contributed 10 recommendations to reduce low-value care. Recommendations from other specialties may also identify opportunities to improve quality and patient safety in emergency care. The Choosing Wisely work group of the ACEP Quality and Patient Safety Committee seeks to identify and characterize the Choosing Wisely recommendations from other professional societies with the highest relevance to emergency care.; METHODS: In June 2016, all Choosing Wisely recommendations from other specialties were obtained from the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation. Using a modified Delphi method, the 10 group members rated recommendations for relevance on a validated 7-point scale. Recommendations identified as highly relevant (median score=7) were rated on 3 additional characteristics: cost savings (1=large, 5=none), risk-benefit profile (1=benefit >risk, 5=risk >benefit), and actionability by emergency physicians (1=complete, 5=none). Results are presented as overall means (eg, mean of subcategory means) and subcategory means with SDs.; RESULTS: Initial review of 412 recommendations identified 49 items as highly relevant to emergency care. Eleven were redundant with ACEP recommendations, leaving 38 items from 25 professional societies. Overall means for items ranged from 1.57 to 3.1. Recommendations' scores averaged 3.2 (SD 0.6) for cost savings, 1.9 (SD 0.4) for risk-benefit, and 1.6 (SD 0.5) for actionability. The most common conditions in these recommendations were infectious diseases (14 items; 37%), head injury (4 items; 11%), and primary headache disorders (4 items; 11%). The most frequently addressed interventions were imaging studies (11 items; 29%) and antibiotics (9 items; 24%).; CONCLUSION: Thirty-eight Choosing Wisely recommendations from other specialties are highly relevant to emergency care. Imaging studies and antibiotic use are heavily represented among them. Copyright © 2018 American College of Emergency Physicians. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The loss of p53 function is a central event in the genesis of osteosarcoma (OS). How mutation of p53 enables OS development from osteoblastic lineage cells is poorly understood. We and others have reported a key role for elevated and persistent activation of the cAMP/PKA/Creb1 pathway in maintenance of OS. In view of the osteoblast lineage being the cell of origin of OS, we sought to determine how these pathways interact within the context of the normal osteoblast. Normal osteoblasts (p53 WT) rapidly underwent apoptosis in response to acute elevation of cAMP levels or activity, whereas p53-deficient osteoblasts tolerated this aberrant cAMP/Creb level and activity. Using the p53 activating small-molecule Nutlin-3a and cAMP/Creb1 activator forskolin, we addressed the question of how p53 responds to the activation of cAMP. We observed that p53 acts dominantly to protect cells from excessive cAMP accumulation. We identify a Creb1-Cbp complex that functions together with and interacts with p53. Finally, translating these results we find that a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the Creb1-Cbp interaction demonstrates selective toxicity to OS cells where this pathway is constitutively active. This highlights the cAMP/Creb axis as a potentially actionable therapeutic vulnerability in p53-deficient tumors such as OS. These results define a mechanism through which p53 protects normal osteoblasts from excessive or abnormal cAMP accumulation, which becomes fundamentally compromised in OS.

AB We have assessed the risks associated with setting 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5°C temperature goals and ways to manage them in a systematic manner and discussed their implications. The results suggest that, given the uncertainties in climate sensitivity, "net zero emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the second half of this century" is a more actionable goal for society than the 2 or 1.5°C temperature goals themselves. If the climate sensitivity is proven to be relatively high and the temperature goals are not met even when the net zero emission goal is achieved, the options left are: (A) accepting/adapting to a warmer world, (B) boosting mitigation, and (C) climate geoengineering, or any combination of these. This decision should be made based on a deeper discussion of risks associated with each option. We also suggest the need to consider a wider range of policies: not only climate policies, but also broader "sustainability policies", and to envisage more innovative solutions than what integrated assessment models can currently illustrate. Finally, based on a consideration of social aspects of risk decisions, we recommend the establishment of a panel of "intermediate layer" experts, who support decision-making by citizens as well as social and ethical thinking by policy makers.

AB Background: In order to facilitate implementation of precision medicine in clinical management of cancer, there is a need to harmonise and standardise the reporting and interpretation of clinically relevant genomics data.; Methods: The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group (TR and PM WG) launched a collaborative project to propose a classification system for molecular aberrations based on the evidence available supporting their value as clinical targets. A group of experts from several institutions was assembled to review available evidence, reach a consensus on grading criteria and present a classification system. This was then reviewed, amended and finally approved by the ESMO TR and PM WG and the ESMO leadership.; Results: This first version of the ESMO Scale of Clinical Actionability for molecular Targets (ESCAT) defines six levels of clinical evidence for molecular targets according to the implications for patient management: tier I, targets ready for implementation in routine clinical decisions; tier II, investigational targets that likely define a patient population that benefits from a targeted drug but additional data are needed; tier III, clinical benefit previously demonstrated in other tumour types or for similar molecular targets; tier IV, preclinical evidence of actionability; tier V, evidence supporting co-targeting approaches; and tier X, lack of evidence for actionability.; Conclusions: The ESCAT defines clinical evidence-based criteria to prioritise genomic alterations as markers to select patients for targeted therapies. This classification system aims to offer a common language for all the relevant stakeholders in cancer medicine and drug development.

AB BACKGROUND: Modeling personalized treatment pathways plays an important role in understanding essential/critical treatment behaviors performed on patients during their hospitalizations and thus provides the opportunity for the improvement of better health service delivery in treatment pathways.; OBJECTIVE: Unlike traditional business process mining, modeling personalized treatment pathways is more challenging because they are typically case-specific. Although several studies have been devoted to modeling patient treatment pathways, limited efforts have been made on the extraction of latent semantics and their transitions behind patient treatment pathways, which are often ambiguous and poorly understood.; METHODS: In this article, we propose an extension of the Hidden Markov Model to mine and model personalized treatment pathways by extracting latent treatment topics and identifying their sequential dependencies in pathways, in the form of probabilistic distributions and transitions of patients' raw Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.; RESULTS: We evaluated the proposed model on 48,024 patients with cardiovascular diseases. A total of 15 treatment topics and their typical transition routes were discovered from EHR data that contained 1,391,251 treatment events with 2786 types of interventions and that were evaluated by ten clinicians manually. The obtained p-values are 0.000146 and 0.009106 in comparison with both Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Sequent Naive Bayes models, respectively; this outcome indicate that our approach achieves a better understanding of human evaluators on modeling personalized treatment pathway than that of benchmark models.; CONCLUSION: The experimental results on a real-world data set clearly suggest that the proposed model has efficiency in mining and modeling personalized treatment pathways. We argue that the discovered treatment topics and their transition routes, as actionable knowledge that represents the practice of treating individual patients in their clinical pathways, can be further exploited to help physicians better understand their specialty and learn from previous experiences for treatment analysis and improvement.

AB The rapid development of sequencing technologies has to led to an explosion of pathogen sequence data, which are increasingly collected as part of routine surveillance or clinical diagnostics. In public health, sequence data are used to reconstruct the evolution of pathogens, to anticipate future spread, and to target interventions. In clinical settings, whole-genome sequencing can identify pathogens at the strain level, can be used to predict phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence, and can inform treatment by linking closely related cases. While sequencing has become cheaper, the analysis of sequence data has become an important bottleneck. Deriving interpretable and actionable results for a large variety of pathogens, each with its own complexity, from continuously updated data is a daunting task that requires flexible bioinformatic workflows and dissemination platforms. Here, we review recent developments in real-time analyses of pathogen sequence data, with a particular focus on the visualization and integration of sequence and phenotype data.

AB The rapid identification of blood culture isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) results play critical roles for the optimal treatment of patients with bloodstream infections. Whereas others have looked at the time to detection in automated culture systems, we examined the overall time from specimen collection to actionable test results. We examined four points of time, namely, blood specimen collection, Gram stain, organism identification (ID), and AST reports, from electronic data from 13 U.S. hospitals for the 11 most common, clinically significant organisms in septic patients. We compared the differences in turnaround times and the times from when specimens were collected and the results were reported in the 24-h spectrum. From January 2015 to June 2016, 165,593 blood specimens were collected, of which, 9.5% gave positive cultures. No matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used during the study period. Across the 10 common bacterial isolates (n = 6,412), the overall median (interquartile range) turnaround times were 0.80 (0.64 to 1.08), 1.81 (1.34 to 2.46), and 2.71 (2.46 to 2.99) days for Gram stain, organism ID, and AST, respectively. For all positive cultures, approximately 25% of the specimens were collected between 6:00 a.m. and 11:59 a.m. In contrast, more of the laboratory reporting times were concentrated between 6:00 a.m. and 11:59 a.m. for Gram stain (43%), organism ID (78%), and AST (82%), respectively (P<0.001). The overall average turnaround times from specimen collection for Gram stain, organism ID, and AST were approximately 1, 2, and 3days, respectively. The laboratory results were reported predominantly in the morning hours. Laboratory automation and work flow optimization may play important roles in reducing the microbiology result turnaround time.

AB It is suggested that subtyping of complex inflammatory diseases can be based on genetic susceptibility and relevant environmental exposure (G+E). We propose that using matched cellular phenotypes in human subjects and corresponding preclinical models with the same G+E combinations is useful to this end. As an example, defective Paneth cells can subtype Crohn's disease (CD) subjects; Paneth cell defects have been linked to multiple CD susceptibility genes and are associated with poor outcome. We hypothesized that CD susceptibility genes interact with cigarette smoking, a major CD environmental risk factor, to trigger Paneth cell defects. We found that both CD subjects and mice with ATG16L1T300A (T300A; a prevalent CD susceptibility allele) developed Paneth cell defects triggered by tobacco smoke. Transcriptional analysis of full-thickness ileum and Paneth cell-enriched crypt base cells showed the T300A-smoking combination altered distinct pathways, including proapoptosis, metabolic dysregulation, and selective downregulation of the PPARgamma pathway. Pharmacologic intervention by either apoptosis inhibitor or PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone prevented smoking-induced crypt apoptosis and Paneth cell defects in T300A mice and mice with conditional Paneth cell-specific knockout of Atg16l1. This study demonstrates how explicit G+E can drive disease-relevant phenotype and provides rational strategies for identifying actionable targets.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-20% of diagnosed breast tumours, with higher incidence in young and African-American women, and it is frequently associated with BRCA germline mutations. Chemotherapy is the only well-established therapeutic option in both early- and advanced-stages of the disease. TNBC tumours relapse earlier after standard anthracycline- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy treatments, generally within 1-3years after the diagnosis, and often develop visceral metastases, representing the subtype with a worse prognosis among all breast cancers. In the present review, we will provide an updated overview of the available results of recent clinical trials for this disease and we will describe the implications of the known molecular pathways representing novel targets for development of future therapies for TNBC patients.; RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past decade, the advent of gene expression micro-array technology has led to the identification of different actionable targets including various genomic alterations, androgen receptor, PARP, PI3K, VEGF and other proteins of the angiogenic pathway. Thus, novel targeted drugs have been tested in clinical trials reporting promising results in specific TNBC molecular subgroups. Although cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for TNBC patients, the identification of novel 'drugable' targets and pathways for developing personalized treatments represents a promising investigational approach in the management of the TNBC subtype.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Managing patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) is a challenging proposition for any treating oncologist. Although the potency of first-line therapies has improved with the approvals of FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, many patients are unable to derive significant benefit from later lines of therapy upon progression. Enrollment on clinical trials remains among the best options for patients with mPDA in all lines of therapy. At our institution, we routinely check for microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of diagnosis in all good performance status mPDA patients. Although MSI-H status is only found in 1% of patients with mPDA, given pembrolizumab's tissue-agnostic approval for MSI-H tumors in later-line settings, it is a viable option when deciding on subsequent lines of therapy. Any use of immune therapy in mPDA is investigational outside the MSI-H setting. NGS can identify BRCA or other DNA damage response (DDR) defects in patients which can predict sensitivity to platinum-based therapies and influence choice of both initial and later lines of therapy. It can also identify rare actionable genomic alterations such as HER2 (2%) and TRK fusions (0.1%) and offer patients the option of enrollment on clinical trials with agents targeting these or other identified alterations. We believe enrolling mPDA patients on clinical trials with immune-modulating agents is critical to determine if there are other patient subsets, outside of the MSI-H setting, who would benefit from these approaches. Immunotherapy's general tolerability and potential to generate durable responses make it particularly appealing for mPDA patients. Although single-modality immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors or vaccines have not demonstrated efficacy in this disease, combinatorial strategies targeting unique aspects of PDA including the tumor microenvironment and desmoplastic stroma have shown preclinical or early-phase success. Validating these treatments with later-phase prospective studies is essential to making immunotherapy a routine component of the treatment armamentarium for mPDA patients.

AB This paper explores our efforts to support the expansion of a regional electronic consultation (eConsult) service on a national level by addressing potential policy barriers. We used an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) strategy based on five key activities leading to a National eConsult Policy Think Tank meeting: (1) identifying potential policy enablers and barriers; (2) engaging national and provincial/territorial partners; (3) including patient voices; (4) undertaking co-design and planning; and (5) adopting a solution-based approach. We successfully leveraged a diverse set of stakeholders in strategic discussions, culminating in actionable suggestions for next steps, which will serve to inform a national implementation strategy.

AB BACKGROUND: One in three clinical trial patients with major depressive disorder report symptomatic improvement with placebo. Strategies to mitigate the effect of placebo responses have focused on modifying study design with variable success. Identifying and excluding or controlling for individuals with a high likelihood of responding to placebo may improve clinical trial efficiency and avoid unnecessary medication trials.; METHODS: Participants included those assigned to the placebo arm (n = 141) of the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures for Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial. The elastic net was used to evaluate 283 baseline clinical, behavioral, imaging, and electrophysiological variables to identify the most robust yet parsimonious features that predicted depression severity at the end of the double-blind 8-week trial. Variables retained in at least 50% of the 100 imputed data sets were used in a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to simultaneously predict the probabilities of response and remission.; RESULTS: Lower baseline depression severity, younger age, absence of melancholic features or history of physical abuse, less anxious arousal, less anhedonia, less neuroticism, and higher average theta current density in the rostral anterior cingulate predicted a higher likelihood of improvement with placebo. The Bayesian model predicted remission and response with an actionable degree of accuracy (both AUC > 0.73). An interactive calculator was developed predicting the likelihood of placebo response at the individual level.; CONCLUSION: Easy-to-measure clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological assessments can be used to identify placebo responders with a high degree of accuracy. Development of this calculator based on these findings can be used to identify potential placebo responders. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.
