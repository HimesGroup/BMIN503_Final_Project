## Overview {#sec-overview}

Preventing unintended teenage pregnancy is a public health priority that can be mitigated by individual uptake of effective contraception in sexually active teens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a publicly available dataset called the National High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) that contains information on important health behaviors and experiences in American high school students. Thus, the goal of this project is to use data from the YRBS to see what proportion of sexually active adolescents that were assigned female at birth (AFAB) utilize pregnancy prevention methods, which pregnancy methods are most popular among them, and whether these outcomes vary by sexual minority status.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Despite decreases over the past several decades, unintended teenage pregnancy continues to persist as a public health problem that, compared to other high income countries, is especially prevalent in the United States.^1^ One objective of Healthy People 2030, an initiative from the US Department of Health and Human Services that identifies public health priorities to improve health and well-being across the United States,^2^ is to \"increase the proportion of adolescent females who used effective birth control the last time they had sex.\"^3^ In fact, several Healthy People 2030 objectives are related to adolescent sexual education, behaviors, and outcomes.^4^ There has also been extensive evidence demonstrating that teen pregnancy has negative lifelong consequences for both the birthing parent and the child.^5^ Teen pregnancy is also a health disparities issue. Disparities have been observed by age, race, geography, and socioeconomic status.^6^ Moreover, prior work has found that sexual minority adolescents are at a greater risk of teenage pregnancy than their heterosexual peers.^7--10^ This justifies an examination of contraceptive use by sociodemographic factors.

Addressing and acquiring knowledge about adolescent contraceptive use requires an interdisciplinary approach. In addition to thinking about unintended pregnancy as a public health issue, behavioral experts (e.g., psychologists, health behaviorists) can contribute to our understanding of which adolescents choose to use contraception methods and what characteristics they express. Additionally, contraceptive access is of concern as adolescents may not have the financial or transportational means to ascertain pregnancy prevention and/or can lack health literacy around this sexual health. Lastly, because sex is particularly stigmatized among adolescents, teens cannot necessarily rely on their guardians or medical providers for sex-related advice or assistance in utilizing contraception.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

### Load Necessary Packages

We will first load several packages that will be used to analyze the YRBS data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tigris)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(grid)
library(leaflet)
library(forecast)
library(ggthemes)
library(png)
```

### Data Import

YRBS does not have data in CSV form, so the dataset had to be downloaded and opened in SAS. Additionally, YRBS provides SAS code for loading and formatting the data. Thus, the data is already properly labelled and formatted. I additionally filtered out data from years outside of 2015-2021. No other data cleaning was conducted.

```{r}
yrbs <- read.csv("/Users/gmzuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Desktop/UPenn/Coursework/Fall 2023/EPID 6000/yrbs2015-2021.csv")
```

### Data Cleaning

Missing values are currently coded as the string "Missing" and must be changed to NA.

```{r}
yrbs[yrbs=="Missing"] <- NA
```

We only want to include students who report that their sex is female.

```{r}
yrbs.female <- yrbs[yrbs$sex == "Female" & !is.na(yrbs$sex),]
```

Now, we will limit the dataset to only include variables of interest as there are currently \>200 variables to look through in the dataset.

```{r}
#yrbs.female <- yrbs.female %>% select(c("year","weight","stratum","PSU","record", #Survey Design "age","sex","grade","race4","race7","sexid","sexid2", #Demographics "q59","q60","q61","q62","q63","q64","q65","sexpart","sexpart2", #Sex-related "q30","q34","q37","q38","q40","q45","q48","q49","q51","q52","q53","q54","q55","q56","q57" #Risky Behaviors))
```

### Data Checks

It is good statistical practice to check the distributions of the variables that will be used to ensure that they make sense.

```{r}
```
