Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, but this is not required.

### Overview
Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

>I plan to explore the relationship between adverse childhood experiences / stressful life events and risk of mild cognitive impairment and
Alzheimer’s Disease (MCI/AD). These events may act as an effect modifier in between cognitive resilience and AD outcomes. I will assess both
presence of MCI/AD and age of MCI/AD onset across levels of adverse/stressful experiences and proxy measures of cognitive resilience. The results
of our research may inform management of stressful events to reduce risk of cognitive decline.

### Introduction 
Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

> An estimated 5.8 million people had Alzheimer’s Dementia in the US in 20201. This condition presents a significant public health, economic, and
emotional burden for those affected and their communities2. Many older adults do not exhibit clinical symptoms of dementia, despite substantial
pathology3. Cognitive resilience is thought to explain variations in functioning between those with similar levels of pathology, with greater
reserve protecting against cognitive decline4. Measures of cognitive resilience have been associated with reduced susceptibility to cognitive
insults, including dementia, and traumatic brain injury5,6. However, cognitive resilience is difficult to measure and define with key proxies
including education level and participation in mentally engaging activities in later life7,8. In contrast, negative life experiences such as
depression and affective loss have been associated with earlier age of AD onset9. Stressful life events, particularly early stressful life events
have previously been associated with greater susceptibility to poor mental health10. In mouse models, exposure to stress in early life was linked
to decreased adult cognitive ability11. This evidence suggests a possible relationship between early childhood / lifetime stressors and increased
risk of dementia.
	To approach this problem, I will use background knowledge and techniques from multiple fields. Research in the fields of neuroscience and
	psychology aid in understanding the mechanisms of MCI/AD and the role of stressful life events in future health. We know that individuals with
	similar MCI/AD pathology can have vastly difference cognitive performance, and that demographic, education, and behavioral factors explain some
	of the variation across pathology and cognitive performance. Psychology and medicine have identified long term mental and physical health
	consequences of adverse childhood experiences / stressful life events, and which events in particular lead to substantial stress. Knowledge of
	epidemiology can be used to design a study that explores the relationship between these three factors in a human population, calling also upon
	biostatistics to formally assess and test hypotheses. Finally, I can use bioinformatics tools to work with large datasets and create compelling
	visual displays of my results. 


### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

maybe do PCA on the different domains of childhood adversity and stressful life events to see if they all cluster together and can use a summary measure or if you should include different domains in the model - same for stressful life events
  do PCA with all the individual domains and then plot using the summary measure to color code?


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
