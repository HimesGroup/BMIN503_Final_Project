### Overview
The goal of this project was to develop an automated method for prioritizing likely clinically actionable results from genetic studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is expected that annotating genes implicated in ASD with evidence that is functionally relavent to the known etiology of this disorder will be useful to identifying risk genes that are more likely to be clinically relevant. The ultimate goal is to use this information to help clinicians be more informed when making key decisions regarding the benefits of ordering genetic testing for a patient with ASD.

### Introduction 
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions with well-established influences from genetic factors. Rapid advancements in genomics technologies have helped generate massive amounts of knowledge on the genetic factors contributing to ASD. Although discovery continues to be important, there are already hundreds of genes and thousands of genomic variants implicated in risk for ASD. As such, it is also important to understand how currently implicated genes can help immediately inform diagnosis and treatment. To make strides toward this goal, it is crucial to identify efficient ways to sort through the sea of association study results to determine which ASD-associated genes are more likely to be clinically-actionable.

While there are numerous challenges limiting the clinical utility of information from genetic studies in ASD, after speaking with Ben Voight, Associate Professor of Genetics, I was able to refine the specific challenges I am interested in addressing. This project addresses two key issues: 1) the 'immediacy' gap which will be bridged by developing an efficient way to sort through genetic data to identify information about known and potentially clinically actionable genes, and 2) the 'processing' gap which will be bridged by working to validate and automate the prioritization method so that the approach can be adapted for future applications in other complex disorders and diseases. As incorporating genomic technology into patient care is largely dependent on clinicians’ perspectives of its utility, it is important to identify ways to better inform clinicians about relevant genetic findings beneficial to optimizing treatment. Following discussions with Allan Pack, John Miclot Professor of Medicine and Assistant Dean and Director of Global Sleep Programs, I identified the specific clinical decision I want to support with the approach—to help clinicians determine if genetic testing will be useful to informing their decisions when planning treatment. Therefore, clinically-actionable genetic information will be defined as any functionally relevant (e.g., expressed in brain, causes an ASD-related phenotype when knocked-out in mice) ASD-associated gene, with evidence indicating that variation in the gene may influence how a patient will respond to a drug. There are a number of excellent resources available that allow for identifying clinically useful ways to interpret information from genetic studies. Dr. Jason Moore, Edward Rose Professor of Informatics, Director of the Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Senior Associate Dean for Informatics and Director of the Division of Informatics in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, helped me to identify the databases that would be useful to the automation of the approach and offered advice on how to validate the approach. Dr. Blanca Himes, Assistant Professor of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics also offered advice regarding approaches that could be used to help validate the gene prioritization pipeline. This project focused on automating a gene prioritization approach using data from DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; http://www.mousephenotype.org/), and the Pharos Drug Ontology database (https://pharos.nih.gov/idg/dto) to identify clinically-actionable candidate genes for ASD. Please see the following for more details: https://github.com/veatcho/BMIN503_Final_Project.git.

### Methods
To identify an initial list of candidate genes for ASD, data available in DisGeNET was queried. The benefits of this database include that the reported gene-disease associations are identified by text-mining data from multiple sources and the data can be automatically pulled via the RCurl package in R. All of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI) that relate to ASD (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, Atypical autism, Autistic Behavior, and Autistic Disorder) were pulled from the disease mappings file provided by the database. An R function provided by DisGeNET was modified to create a data frame of all genes with any level of evidence for a relationship with CUIs representing ASD. These genes were then annotated based on evidence of human brain expression, as this is the tissue most relevant to ASD etiology. A summary of baseline expression results from all available brain regions, expressed at the default level of Transcripts Per Million (TPM)>=0.5, based on RNA-seq data from the GTEx project were downloaded from the Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home). Genes were then annotated with any associated mouse phenotype term (p<0.05) that reflects symptoms in ASD when manipulated in mice. To do this, the genotype-phenotype representational state transfer (REST) application program interface (API) from the IMPC was queried. To identify currently approved drugs that target proteins encoded by genes implicated in ASD, a software request was sent via RCurl to the Pharos API. Targets labeled Tclin (i.e., currently approved) were considered. Please see the following url for more details: https://github.com/veatcho/BMIN503_Final_Project
 
+The first step was to pull all genes with evidence for an association with Autism Spectrum Disorders from DisGeNET. Evidence in the queried database (DisGeNET) includes results from genome-wide association studies, candidate gene studies and analyses of whole-exome sequence data focused on identifying genes housing 'de novo' variants.

+Next, the list of ASD candidate genes was evaluated to identify genes that are specifically expressed in the human brain. As the direct pull for all GTEx data is large, only data for genes expressed at the GTEx default cut-off of TPM>=0.5 in human brain regions were downloaded.

+Next, ASD risk genes were queried to identify genes that when knocked out (KO'd) of mice have an associated phenotype that is comparable to symptoms of ASD that are observed in humans (e.g., Abnormal Nervous System Development=MP:0003631, Abnormal Behavior/Neurological Phenotype=MP:0004924). Note that it is currently necessary to pull 'top level terms' from IMPC. Details for requesting mouse-phenotype data can be found here: http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/documentation/data-access.

ASDGenes.BrainExp.MouseKOPheno.DrugTarget <- left_join(ASDGenes.BrainExp.MouseKOPheno, tclintargets, by='Gene.Name')
```

+Next, we evaluated if the annotations observed for the 'ASD gene set' were different for ASD risk genes by evaluating the same annotations in a random sample of human protein coding genes. The random gene set was equal to the number of ASD risk genes pulled from DisGeNET that encode protein products in UniProt (n=916).

### Results
More ASD Risk Genes are Expressed in the Human Brain Compared to Other Evaluated Annotations

There were 916 unique protein coding genes with evidence for a relationship with ASD based on data available in DisGeNET. Of these, 847 (92.5%) were observed to meet a default cut-off level of  TPM>=5 in at least one brain region based on RNA-seq of human brain tissue. In addition, there were 128 ASD risk genes (14.0%) that encoded a protein that is an FDA-approved drug target. Furthermore, 98 ASD risk genes (10.7%) were associated with either a nervous system or behavioral phenotype when knocked out of mouse models.

Compared to a Random Gene Set, ASD Risk Genes are More Often Expressed in Brain, have a Mouse KO Phenotype, and Encode Drug Targets

After comparing the annotations that were selected to prioritize ASD risk genes for a subset of 916 genes that were randomly selected from all known human protein coding genes, it was observed that a higher proportion of ASD risk genes were expressed in the human brain (0.92 ASD genes vs. 0.83 random genes, p=4.22x10-9). In addition, more ASD risk genes were associated with a nervous system or behavioral phenotype when knocked out of mice (0.11 ASD genes vs 0.08 random genes, p=3.58x10-2). Furthermore, more ASD risk genes encoded approved drug targets (0.14 ASD genes vs 0.03 random genes, p=3.48x10-16).

ASD Risk Gene Expression Patterns in the Hippocampus and Hypothalamus are Distinct from a Random Gene Set

Based on results form hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns across all available brain regions in GTEx, it appears that the major differences between ASD risk genes and the random gene set is that ASD risk genes have more similar levels of expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus while gene expression of the random genes in these regions does not cluster together.

Distinct Traits are Associated with Knocking Out ASD Genes in Mice

A number of phenotypes associated with knocking out an ASD risk gene were not observed when knocking out genes in the random gene set. These included traits that reflect common core symptoms and comorbidities observed in individuals with ASD (e.g., abnormal vocalization, decreased exploration in a new environment, convulsive seizures). While a higher proportion of ASD risk genes were associated with the 'top level terms' from IMPC for Abnormal Nervous System Development (MP:0003631) and Abnormal Behavior/Neurological Phenotypes (MP:0004924), the proportions of genes associated with the more specific phenotypes in these categories, that were also observed for genes in the random gene set, were not significantly increased.

The ASD Gene Prioritization Approach Identified 14 Genes

Of the original set of 916 genes pulled from DisGeNET with evidence for an association with ASD, 14 genes were prioritized for having all functional attributes of interest. All of these genes are expressed in the brain, associated with an ASD-related trait when knocked out of mice, and encode FDA-approved drug targets. These genes are of particular interest for follow-up studies that will be focused on evaluating current evidence for containing clinically-relevant variants (e.g., pathogenic, pharmacogenomic).
``` {r eval=TRUE}
#How many/which ASD Risk genes have evidence in all three functional categories
ASDallannotations<-ASDGenes.BrainExp.MouseKOPheno.DrugTarget %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gene.ID)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Mouse.GeneID)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(genes.y)) %>%
  distinct(Gene.Name, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
  select(Gene.Name)

ASDallannotations
```

Overall, the approach was capable of capturing functionally-relevant information related to currently implicated ASD risk genes. There were 847 ASD risk genes expressed in human brain and 98 with associated ASD-related phenotypes in mouse knock-outs. In addition, 129 ASD risk genes encode currently approved drug targets, indicating these are potentially clinically actionable. Notably, to ultimately translate results from human genetic studies into the clinic it is often necessary to conduct extensive research focused on deciphering the mechanisms underlying expression of symptoms in ASD in relation to individual genes. Considering the large number of genes implicated in ASD, functional characterization for each gene would limit the ability to rapidly deliver evidence useful to informing personalized approaches to treatment. From the larger list of 916 candidate genes, our method identified a small subset (n=14) that meet all of the chosen functional criteria and have strong potential to be clinically-relevant. We expect these results may have helped pinpoint the ASD candidate genes that should be prioritized for future work aimed at more detailed functional characterization.
