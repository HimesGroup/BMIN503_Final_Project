### Overview
This analysis seeks to determine how changes in community mobility, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and vaccination relate to weekly changes in SARS-CoV-2 case incidence at the county level. County-level vaccination prevalence and case incidence data are publicly available on the CDC website. Community mobility data is captured using Google's county-level COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. SARS-CoV-2 variant data is from a study led by Dr. Brendan Kelly and Dr. Rick Bushman in PSOM involving metagenomic viral whole genome sequencing (WGS) performed on COVID-19 tests from Penn Medicine clinical laboratories. 

### Introduction 
Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, scientists have been developing statistical models to predict various epidemiologic outcomes in different areas of the world. This analysis will contribute to that knowledge base by examining how changes in community mobility, vaccine prevalence, and SARS-CoV-2 variants are related to weekly changes in case incidence in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties. As Google social mobility data is available starting February 15, 2020, the analysis spans from then through October 2, 2021, using MMWR week as time intervals. The above-referenced study in PSOM randomly samples SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens collected at UPHS facilities with cycle threshold (Ct) values < 30. Whole genome sequencing is performed on these specimens, which have higher viral loads, to identify the variant. The results of WGS will be used as an additional explanatory variable in this analysis to indicate which SARS-CoV-2 variants were dominant in each MMWR week in the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area during the study period.  

This analysis draws upon microbiology for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and infectious disease epidemiology, biostatistics, and informatics to analyze and interpret the relationship between dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination, and change in case incidence. Geographical epidemiology will also contribute to the analysis in the form of visualizing the change in vaccinations, cases, variants, and community mobility across time in the target geographic areas. In addition, this analysis incorporates the behavioral sciences, as it seeks to identify whether social behavior (i.e., community mobility data) is associated with case incidence. 
One particular difficulty I had in the initial phase of this analysis was data harmonization. I examined a plethora of datasets from the CDC, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Google, and OpenDataPhilly before I was able to find data that covered the time span and geographic areas of interest. My discussion with Dr. John Holmes was especially helpful for finalizing the data harmonization aspect of this analysis. He explained that if I were trying to publish this project, I would need express written permission from the CDC to link their data to other data sources. However, for a class project, it is fine to link the data to other sources without obtaining permission. In addition, I consulted Dr. Joe Romano regarding the machine learning portion of this analysis. Finally, I spoke with Dr. Sherrie Xie, in geographic epidemiology, to gain insights on creating maps to effectively demonstrate the changes in my study variables over time.

### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


The majority of the data for this analysis was publicly available via the Internet. 
[The county-level vaccination data is on the CDC website and can be accessed via the Socrata Open Data API (SODA).](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh). The CDC's county-level case data is not accessible through SODA, but can be downloaded manually from the [COVID-19 Integrated County View page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view&list_select_map_data_parent=Risk&map-metrics-cv-comm-transmission=community_transmission_level&list_select_map_data_metro=all).
To obtain county-level time-series case data, each county must be selected individually and downloaded. Google Community Mobility Reports are available for [2020](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020_US_Region_Mobility_Report.csv) and [2021](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2021_US_Region_Mobility_Report.csv).

The counties of interest in this analysis are:
PA: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Philadelphia
NJ: Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Mercer 
DE: New Castle

Each dataset (CDC vaccine, CDC case, and Google community mobility) contains county-level time-series data with days as the interval. This analysis uses *MMWR* week as the time interval, so the county-level data in each dataset is aggregated by *MMWR* week, using MMWRweek::MMWRweek. The *MMWR* week is used for disease incidence and public health reporting, with values ranging from 1 through 53, and Sunday being the first day of any *MMWR* week (1). 

The Google Community Mobility Reports date back to February 15, 2020. CDC case data did not exist prior to March 2020, and CDC vaccination data does not pick up fully vaccinated individuals prior to January 2021. Therefore, rows of zeros were added to vaccine and case data so that it could be merged with the social mobility dataset, joining on county and *MMWR* week.

Suppressed values CDC
### Suppressed cells need to be replaced with minimum observed cases by county.
# 0 values are not included when considering minimum number of cases.

Suppressed values Google
### Mean_parks and mean_transit_stations contain NAs.
# [Missing values are a result of activity being too 
# low upon a specific day and therefore not achieving the 
# anonymity threshold set by Google](https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9825414?hl=en)


Case and vaccine variables have been adjusted for county population based on estimates from the 2019 U.S. Census.

### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

### Independent Variables
The investigators hypothesized that mean vaccine prevalence per population (vacc_prevalence_per100thou) would be significantly associated with change in case incidence per population. However, mean vaccine incidence per population was identified as significant at p < 0.05 in the bivariate modeling stage. In addition, one Google social mobility variable, mean retail and recreation, was significantly associated with mean case increase or no increase.

```


As a final step, the areas  under the curve (AUC) for training and test sets are calculated, and the corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are generated. The AUCs are 0.63 and 0.62 for training and test data, respectively. These numbers indicate that the predictive accuracy is not very good, and therefore, the model does not distinguish well between no case increase and case increase. The plot of the ROC curves illustrate that the model does not have a very good measure of separability.

Additionally, the AUCs for training and test data are very similar.
