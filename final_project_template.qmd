## Overview {#sec-overview}

In anticipation of opening CHOP's first inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric units and Crisis Response Center (CRC) in January 2024, our leadership is interested in having a better, data informed understanding of volume and acuity of behavioral health presentations to the current CHOP emergency rooms in order to better inform staffing.

Faculty that are participating in this project are Weston Geddings, MD, Medical Director of Emergency Psychiatric Services who is overseeing the development of the Crisis Response Center and Joy Payton, Supervisor of Data Education at ARCUS, Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at Children's who will be aiding in data extraction and analysis.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Prior to 2017, Philadelphia had two city-designated children's crisis response centers (CRCs) that children experiencing a psychiatric emergency could present to as walk-ins for support and treatment 24/7. A CRC is also the designated care space that police or EMTs will bring any child under a 302 warrant for emergency psychiatric evaluation that has been approved by the Office of Mental Health. In 2017, both Philadelphia CRCs closed due to issues relating to volume and capacity, and CHOP had to adapt to sudden increased volumes of children presenting to the CHOP Emergency Room with primarily behavioral health and psychiatric emergencies. In addition, during the COVID pandemic which saw increasing mental health needs in the pediatric population, emergency departments everywhere became safety nets for pediatric mental health care. However, the utilization of emergency departments, which typically lack child and adolescent mental health professionals with appropriate treatment spaces and resources, limits appropriate diagnosis, treatment and disposition. These factors contribute to overutilization of inpatient care due to needs for immediate treatment.

Belmont CRC in Philadelphia has since re-opened, however, CHOP has continued to see high volumes of behavioral health emergencies as both CHOP and the city of Philadelphia has recognized that one children's CRC is not sufficient to meet the needs of the population. In 2022 CHOP submitted and won a bid to open another CRC, and aims to use a trauma informed framework and positive behavioral interventions to guide treatment. This includes having staff on-site who have expertise in recognition and intervention for trauma, including trauma informed care, behavioral intervention for ASD and behavioral disorders, parent interventions, suicide prevention and violence prevention. However, staffing has been an ongoing challenge across numerous hospital systems, and in planning to open this new CRC space and service line, leadership wants to ensure that we not just meet minimal staffing requirements, but that we can plan for appropriate increases in staffing when needed during times of high volume or acuity.

In speaking and working with Dr. Geddings and other emergency room clinicians, it has long been felt that there are trends in the behavioral health volume and acuity presenting to the emergency room depending on time of year as well as time of day, and if we could reliably identify times of high surge we could anticipate increased staffing accordingly to ensure smooth workflow and patient safety since long wait times and increased volumes in an emergency setting can lead to patients leaving without being seen or other unwanted outcomes. In general, the ability to visualize and track this data over time will be useful to operational decision making about resource management. This problem is interdisciplinary given the numerous personnel involved ranging from the current emergency room staff, consulting psychiatrists, clinical social workers, behavioral health technicians, and data analysts.

According to Joy Payton and other data analysts familiar with reporting out emergency room and behavioral health data, there is currently no existing dashboard that offers data visualization for emergency psychiatric presentations that can be analyzed by time and date. Such data availability would be helpful not only in anticipatory staffing, but would allow for longitudinal awareness that could inform needed adjustments in real time.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

The data used was obtained from the CHOP data warehouse, all data is in the aggregrate and free of PHI. Appropriate tables for Emergency Department visits, psychiatric complaints, diagnoses, length of stay, and disposition were located using CHOP data analytic database tools such as Gene. Data will be extracted using SQL into csv files that will then be loaded into R for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Describe the data used and general methodological approach used to address the problem described in the @sec-introduction. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

## Results {#sec-results}

Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. You may refer to the @sec-methods as needed. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

## Conclusion

This the conclusion. The @sec-results can be invoked if you'd like.
