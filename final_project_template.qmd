Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, although this is not required.

## Overview {#sec-overview}

Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem. This should extend what is in the @sec-overview.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

Describe the data used and general methodological approach used to address the problem described in the @sec-introduction. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

## Results {#sec-results}

Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. You may refer to the @sec-methods as needed. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

## Conclusion

This the conclusion. The @sec-results can be invoked if you'd like.
