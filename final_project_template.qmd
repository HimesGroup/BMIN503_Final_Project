## Overview {#sec-overview}

Breast density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Sixteen states, including Pennsylvania (PA), have recently required coverage with co-pays and deductibles for supplemental screenings for breast cancer with MRI or ultrasound for women with dense breasts. The study purpose is to estimate the potential impact of the PA supplemental screening law on the mammography screening population in a large health system. 

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Women with dense breasts have increased risk both for developing breast cancer as well as for false-negative mammograms. Supplemental screening with breast MRI has been shown to reduce the interval cancer rate among patients with dense breasts. In May 2023, Pennsylvania (PA) mandated insurance coverage of one supplemental screening study (ultrasound or breast MRI) annually for women with dense breasts. Prior research suggests that Black women have lower breast density than white women based on subjective grading from the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS), partially due to larger average breast size and higher body mass index (BMI) than white women. Given that Black women have lower prevalence of dense breasts and higher prevalence of triple negative breast cancer, the new supplemental screening law may meaningfully reduce racial disparities in breast cancer prognosis and mortality. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential impact of this supplemental screening law on different patient populations in a mammography screening cohort a large health system.

My research problem is interdisciplinary and requires appropriate input from a **multidisciplinary team** including an epidemiologist (McCarthy), surgeon (Fayanju), radiologist (Conant), biostatistician (Chen) in order to have both rigorous methods and an appropriate clinical context for understanding the results of my research project. Dr. McCarthy\'s mentorship will focus on epidemiological methods to examine factors that underlie differences in screening utilization by race; with Dr. Fayanju, I will elucidate the importance of carefully considering race and ethnicity in the conduct of the epidemiologic research; with Dr. Conant, I will focus on the clinical implications of MRI screening; with Dr. Kontos, I will understand the differences in the interpretation of density measures and with Dr. Chen, I will use methods to evaluate the additive value of the screening law to improve breast cancer incidence and mortality by race.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

•We included 76,888 mammograms among women aged 40-74 years who identified as Black or White without prior breast cancer or known BRCA1/2 mutations who underwent screening mammography from 2015 to 2021 at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania

•For each mammogram, breast density was characterized according to BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) density categories: almost entirely fatty, scattered areas of fibroglandular density, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense

•Women eligible for insurance coverage for supplemental screening in PA include those with:

•extremely dense breasts 

•heterogeneously dense breasts and \>20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, estimated using the Gail model.

•We defined a false negative mammogram as a cancer diagnosis within one year of a negative mammogram (initial BI-RADS Assessment Negative or Benign). 

•We tested for associations of eligibility according to the PA law with risk of a false negative mammogram, adjusting for age and race among Black and White women with negative mammograms.
