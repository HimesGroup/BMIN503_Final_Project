### Introduction {sec-overview=""}

The health status of individuals during pregnancy is influenced by various interconnected factors, including socioeconomic, environmental, and healthcare system factors. However, structural racism underpinning these factors often leads to biased healthcare practices for pregnant women, impacting health outcomes. This bias can manifest at the patient, provider, neighborhood, and health system levels. The problem is inherently interdisciplinary. Fields such as public health, sociology, and healthcare management can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the challenges.
