Indication: Endocarditis.
Height: (in) 65
Weight (lb): 165
BSA (m2): 1.82 m2
BP (mm Hg): 134/52
HR (bpm): 75
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2181-10-22**] at 15:26
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2181-5-23**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter or pacing wire
is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferior - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate
PA systolic hypertension.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Right pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and distal half of
the anterior septum and anterior wall and apex. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
CAD. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation. No discrete vegetation identified (does not
exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-23**], the distal
inferior wall is now hypokinetic (may be related to image quality). The
severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now
increased.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2179**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
