"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function. ?RV strain/persistent o2 requirement
Height: (in) 68
Weight (lb): 147
BSA (m2): 1.79 m2
BP (mm Hg): 142/77
HR (bpm): 73
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2184-3-4**] at 09:30
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Moderately depressed LVEF. Cannot
assess LVEF.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but is moderately depressed. Overall
left ventricular EF cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
