INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2114-2-5**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Depressed
LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal inferior
- akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic function.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion circumferential.
Pericardium appears thickened. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic function appears depressed with
inferior akinesis, inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis
elsewhere (LV ejection fraction ?35%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. The pericardium appears thickened. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-2-5**], pericardial
efffusion appears similar.
