"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Chronic lung disease. Left ventricular function. Mitral valve disease. Right ventricular function. Shortness of breath.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2153-3-19**] at 11:50
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

Conclusions:
Unable to pass TEE probe. Resistance in upper esophagous
Limited epicardial study
Prebypass

The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. LV systolic function appeaqrs to be moderately globally depress
(LVEF-35-40%)

Post Bypass
The patient is on epinephrine 0.05 uck/kg/min
LV function now appears normal in the setting of inotropes (LVEF~ 55%)
There are ring prosthese in the mitral and tricuspid position.
No residual MR [**First Name (Titles) 5**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is visualized.
