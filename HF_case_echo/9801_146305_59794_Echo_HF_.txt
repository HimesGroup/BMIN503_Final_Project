Indication: Valvular heart disease.
Height: (in) 66
Weight (lb): 176
BSA (m2): 1.90 m2
BP (mm Hg): 94/52
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2181-9-6**] at 11:34
Test: TTE(Complete)
Doppler: Complete pulse and color flow
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate mitral annular calcification. There is mild thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate [[**12-13**]+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve is not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with inferior,
septal and anterior hypokinesis. The apex is not fully visualized but is
probably hypokinetic/akinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable) of [**2174-2-10**], the left
ventricle is now hypertrophied with impaired systolic function.
