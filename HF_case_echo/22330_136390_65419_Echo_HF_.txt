"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Pericardial effusion.
Height: (in) 64
Weight (lb): 170
BSA (m2): 1.83 m2
BP (mm Hg): 101/46
HR (bpm): 74
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2115-3-11**] at 09:29
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited doppler and color doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. RV function depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Borderline
PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Conclusions:
1.. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
2. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface
of the heart. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2115-3-8**], there has been no
significant change.
