"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Congestive heart failure. Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 55
Weight (lb): 126
BSA (m2): 1.44 m2
BP (mm Hg): 101/63
HR (bpm): 87
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2199-5-20**] at 11:30
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2199-4-18**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal
inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic function.
[Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more depressed given the severity of
TR]. Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV pressure/volume
overload.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate to severe
[3+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS. Physiologic (normal) PR. The
end-diastolic PR velocity is increased c/w PA diastolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Bilateral pleural effusions.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated and there is probable right ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate mitral annular calcification with associated mild
mitral inflow gradient. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-18**], left ventricular
systolic function is now slightly jmore vigorous. There is evidence of severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in both studies.

NOTE: Transthorcic echocardiography cannot adequately assess left atrial
thrombus; this can be better assess by transesophageal echocardiography if
clinically indicated.
