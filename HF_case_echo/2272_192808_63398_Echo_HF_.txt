Indication: Congestive heart failure. Coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function. Mitral valve disease. Myocardial infarction. Pulmonary hypertension.
Height: (in) 60
Weight (lb): 150
BSA (m2): 1.65 m2
BP (mm Hg): 158/62
HR (bpm): 73
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2157-9-13**] at 14:57
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full doppler and color doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA
and/or RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Severe regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Mild global LV hypokinesis.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal
inferoseptal - akinetic; mid inferoseptal - akinetic; basal inferior -
akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**11-19**]+] TR.
Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Based on [**2149**]
AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a
moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Wit
severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior, inferolateral,
and anterolateral walls. No discrete left ventricular thrombus is seen, but
apical images are suboptimal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global and
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other
diffuse process. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate
mitral regurgitation.

Based on [**2149**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.
