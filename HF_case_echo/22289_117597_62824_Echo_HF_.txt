BSA (m2): 2.03 m2
BP (mm Hg): 101/56
HR (bpm): 75

Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2108-12-7**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with <35%
decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-20mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Moderate global
LV hypokinesis. Estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate
[[**12-12**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.
Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF =30-35%). The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.2L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-7**], biventricular
systolic function is more depressed. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is higher.
These findings are suggestive of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid).

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2107**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
