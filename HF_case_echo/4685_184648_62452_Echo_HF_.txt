"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Aortic valve disease. Congestive heart failure. Left ventricular function.  ?  Pericardial effusion.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2121-2-21**] at 11:18
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: No Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: There is severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Image quality was suboptimal.

Conclusions:
Very limited study. No doppler studies were performed making it impossible to
assess valvular regurgitation or stenosis. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review)
of [**2121-2-20**], the LV function is even worse with severe global hypokinesis.
