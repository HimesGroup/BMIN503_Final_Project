"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Congestive heart failure. Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 64
Weight (lb): 112
BSA (m2): 1.53 m2
BP (mm Hg): 139/69
HR (bpm): 68
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2147-6-19**] at 13:21
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Dilated IVC (>2.5cm)
with no change with respiration (estimated RAP >20 mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Moderate-severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal
arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Filamentous
strands on the aortic leaflets c/with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral annular
calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with
the houseofficer caring for the patient. Left pleural effusion. Ascites.

Conclusions:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is >20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There are filamentous strands on the aortic
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report of [**2141-8-17**] (stress echo), the findings are new
and c/w a cardiomyopathy. In the absence of a prominent hisory of systemic
hypertension, an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid) should be considered.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2146**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
