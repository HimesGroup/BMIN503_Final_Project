"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function./ hypotension
Height: (in) 62
Weight (lb): 270
BSA (m2): 2.17 m2
BP (mm Hg): 106/40
HR (bpm): 82
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2182-1-28**] at 11:00
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severe mitral annular calcification.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is elongated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-12-11**],
the aortic stenosis is more severe by doppler. The limited views now suggest
the LV function is normal. The PA pressure has increased significantly.
