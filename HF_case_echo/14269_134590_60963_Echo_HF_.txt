Indication: Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 65
Weight (lb): 150
BSA (m2): 1.75 m2
BP (mm Hg): 85/41
HR (bpm): 74
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2156-3-3**] at 12:19
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full doppler and color doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2156-1-7**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated LV cavity. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS. Mild to
moderate ([**1-11**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2156-1-7**], significant
aortic valve gradient was not detected in the prior study (probably due to
suboptimal Doppler study).
