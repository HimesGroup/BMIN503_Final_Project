"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function. Prosthetic valve function. Syncope.
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 185
BSA (m2): 2.02 m2
BP (mm Hg): 100/60
HR (bpm): 90
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2128-7-19**] at 11:48
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2127-5-6**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild global LV
hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV systolic
function. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR well seated,
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate
[[**12-24**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-5-6**], the LVEF has
probably improved. The degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has
increased.
