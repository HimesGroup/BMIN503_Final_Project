INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2153-1-31**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. No thrombus/mass in the body of the LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Severe global LV
hypokinesis. Estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No LV
mass/thrombus. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral valve
annuloplasty ring. No MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may
be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Tricuspid valve
annuloplasty ring. Physiologic TR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Thickened pulmonic valve leaflets. No PS.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Left pleural
effusion. Ascites.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No mass/thrombus seen in the left or right
atrium, but this study is not adequate to fully exclude atrial/atrial
appendage thrombus ((ie atrial appendages not well visualized). There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). The estimated
cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricular apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
without aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. No
mitral regurgitation is seen, though cannot exclude fully due to acoustic
shadowing from the ring. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A
tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present. Physiologic tricuspid
regurgitation is seen, though may be underestimated due to shadowing. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely reduced global systolic function of the left and right
ventricle. Mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty rings present. No mass or thrombi
seen in the atria, though cannot fully exclude by transthoracic
echocardiography. Mildly dilated aortic sinus.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-1-31**], the left
ventricular function is markedly depressed. Mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty
rings are now noted.

If suspicion for atrial thrombus is high, consideration can be given to other
imaging studies (eg cardiac MRI, CT), as the patient is unable to undergo TEE.
