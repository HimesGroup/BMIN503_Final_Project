"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Atrial fibrillation. Dilated CM with planned Biventricular PM/
ICD placement. Evaluate for thrombus.
Height: (in) 69
Weight (lb): 215
BSA (m2): 2.13 m2
BP (mm Hg): 151/63
HR (bpm): 62
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2147-1-11**] at 15:58
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s)

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Moderate global LV hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. Complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical spray. The
posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous lidocaine. No TEE related
complications. 0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue
prior to TEE probe insertion. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
The rhythm appears to be A-V paced. Results were reviewed with the Cardiology
Fellow involved with the patient's care.

Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity is dilated. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (mobile)
atheroma in the descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened c/w aortic sclerosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Depressed LVEF.
