"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Aortic stenosis.  R/o endocarditis.
BP (mm Hg): 110/65
HR (bpm): 85
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2121-2-25**] at 11:31
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Complete pulse and color flow
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is normal in size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTA: There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild mitral annular
calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve appears structurally normal with trivial
tricuspid regurgitation. There is no mass or vegetation detected on the
tricuspid valve.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed in the
location listed above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the
procedure. The patient was sedated for the TEE. Medications and dosages are
listed above (see Test Information section). Local anesthesia was provided by
lidocaine spray. There were no TEE related complications. 0.2 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion.
The rhythm appears to be atrial flutter. The echocardiographic results were
reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer caring for the patient. A left
pleural effusion is present.

Conclusions:
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed.
2. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending thoracic
aorta.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate (or
possibly severe) aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The severity of aortic stenosis could not be quantified.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. No evidence of endocarditis seen.
