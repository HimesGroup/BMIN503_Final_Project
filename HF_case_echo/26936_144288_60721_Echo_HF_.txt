"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function.  Congestive heart failure. Cardiomyopathy.
Height: (in) 71
Weight (lb): 284
BSA (m2): 2.45 m2
BP (mm Hg): 114/58
HR (bpm): 95
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2165-10-7**] at 12:01
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: Definity
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2164-12-10**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter or pacing wire
is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV cavity. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. LV inflow pattern
c/w restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated LA pressure.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Borderline
PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Left
pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-12-10**], the findings
are similar (left ventricular dysfunction was also global on review of the
prior study and right ventricular free wall hypokinesis was also present.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now suggested.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2165**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
