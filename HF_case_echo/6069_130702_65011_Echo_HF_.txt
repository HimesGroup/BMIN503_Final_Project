"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Cerebrovascular event/TIA.
Height: (in) 63
Weight (lb): 155
BSA (m2): 1.74 m2
BP (mm Hg): 123/45
HR (bpm): 71
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2117-3-1**] at 12:09
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2116-7-19**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal inferior
- hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Mild to
moderate ([**1-17**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No TS. Mild [1+]
TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
inferior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-7-19**], the LVEF has
significantly improved.
