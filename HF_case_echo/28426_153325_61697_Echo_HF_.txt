INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2123-12-29**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Inferobasal
LV aneurysm. Cannot exclude LV mass/thrombus. Severely depressed LVEF. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Moderate (2+)
MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an
inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot
be excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with thinning and akinesis/aneurysm of the inferolateral wall and akinesis of
the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall and apex. (LVEF= 20-25 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: RV size and function appear normal. Severely reduced LV systolic
function with akinetic/aneurysmal inferolateral wall and akinesis of the
mid-LAD territory. There may be a thrombus in the LV apex but this appearance
may be due to near-field artifact. IV echo contrast could not be used due to
the [**Hospital 159**] medical issues. A cardiac MR may help to clarify. At least
moderate mitral regurgitation, probably due to tethering of the posterior
mitral valve leaflet.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-12-29**], the findings
are similar. There is a stronger suggestion of an apical thrombus on the
current study although this may reflect acquisition of the images rather than
a true change.
