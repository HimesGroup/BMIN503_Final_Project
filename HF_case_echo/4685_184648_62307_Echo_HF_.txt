Indication: Aortic valve disease. Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 72
Weight (lb): 285
BSA (m2): 2.48 m2
BP (mm Hg): 80/54
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2121-2-21**] at 13:14
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Complete pulse and color flow
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate mitral annular calcification.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. There is global
hypokinesis with more marked septal hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of earlier
today, there is an improvement in overall LV function with a new echodensity
in the right ventricle consistent with a pacemaker lead.
