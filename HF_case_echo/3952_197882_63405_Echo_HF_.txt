INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2127-7-11**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Normal IVC diameter (<=2.1cm) with >50%
decrease with sniff (estimated RA pressure (0-5 mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline dilated LV cavity
size. Severe global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Mild
(1+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated
LA pressure.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No TS. Mild [1+]
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-7-11**], severe
biventricular systolic dysfunction is now present.
