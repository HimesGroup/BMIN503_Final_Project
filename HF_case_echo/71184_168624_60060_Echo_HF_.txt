"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function. Myocardial infarction. Shortness of breath.
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 215
BSA (m2): 2.15 m2
BP (mm Hg): 120/57
HR (bpm): 77
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2186-12-12**] at 10:10
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2185-6-30**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild-moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately depressed LVEF. False LV tendon
(normal variant). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Physiologic MR (within normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. No PS.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior
septum, inferior wall, and apex. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The remaining segments contract normally.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-6-30**], left ventricular
systolic dysfunction is new. Trivial aortic regurgitation is now seen.
