Indication: Congestive heart failure. Coronary artery disease.
Weight (lb): 235
BP (mm Hg): 105/50
HR (bpm): 66
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2109-11-12**] at 11:47
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral annular
calcification. Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
