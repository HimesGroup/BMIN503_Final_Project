Indication: Congestive heart failure. Myocardial infarction.
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 190
BSA (m2): 2.04 m2
BP (mm Hg): 96/63
HR (bpm): 83
Status: Inpatient

Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2123-1-5**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV cavity. No LV
mass/thrombus. Severely depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Mild
PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regioanl akinesis of the
mid to distal anterior wall, septum, apex and the entire inferior wall. There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-1-5**], the anterior,
septal and apical akinesis is new (mid to distal LAD stenosis?).
