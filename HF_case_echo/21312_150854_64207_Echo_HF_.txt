Indication: Congestive heart failure.
Weight (lb): 257
BP (mm Hg): 158/75
HR (bpm): 79

Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (tape not available)
of [**2181-1-31**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. TVI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis
(AVR). Increased AVR gradient.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function may be mildly depressed (estimated ejection fraction ?50%) but views
are technically suboptimal. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricle is not well visualized. The aortic valve is not well seen. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification with
associated mitral inflow gradient. At least mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of
[**2181-1-31**], the prosthetic aortic valve gradient is similar. Views are
technically suboptimal for comparison of ventricular function.
