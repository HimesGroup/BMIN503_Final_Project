INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2146-1-6**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter or pacing wire
is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severely
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral E-wave
decel time.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - body habitus. Suboptimal image
quality - ventilator. Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on
call.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis to
akinesis (inferior wall, septum and apex appear akinetic in suboptimal views).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly to moderately
thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is probably mild aortic
stenosis (gradient not fully assessed). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2146-1-6**], findings are
similar.
