"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Pericardial effusion. Tamponade.
BP (mm Hg): 80/60
HR (bpm): 80
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2112-12-13**] at 18:49
Test: Portable TTE(Focused views)
Doppler: No Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the
right atrium and/or right ventricle.

LEFT VENTRICLE: LV systolic function appears depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular cavity is dilated.

PERICARDIUM: There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows. Emergency
study.

Conclusions:
LV systolic function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade: no right ventricular or right atrial collapse seen
although views are technically suboptimal.
