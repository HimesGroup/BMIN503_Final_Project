Weight (lb): 170
BSA (m2): 1.83 m2
BP (mm Hg): 92/54
HR (bpm): 100
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2115-3-4**] at 14:04
Test: TTE (Complete)

Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler. Dilated IVC (>2.5 cm).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Trivial MR. Normal LV inflow pattern for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal tricuspid
valve supporting structures. Mild [1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion circumferential. Brief RA
diastolic collapse. Sgnificant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right atrial diastolic
collapse. There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.

Impression: moderate circumferential pericardial effusion; cardiac tamponade

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2115-2-22**],
the pericardial effusion is significantly more voluminous, and cardiac
tamponade is now present.
