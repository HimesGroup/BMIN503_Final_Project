"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function. Hypotension.PEA. Bradycardia
Height: (in) 71
Weight (lb): 222
BSA (m2): 2.21 m2
BP (mm Hg): 115/50
HR (bpm): 89
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2193-5-30**] at 11:50
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe global LV hypokinesis. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - body habitus. Suboptimal image
quality - patient unable to cooperate.

Conclusions:
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-5-29**],
severe right and left ventricular contractile dysfunction is still present.
