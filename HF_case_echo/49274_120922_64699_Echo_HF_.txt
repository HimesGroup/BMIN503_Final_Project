Indication: Congestive heart failure. Hypertension. Left ventricular function. Pulmonary embolism. Right ventricular function.
Height: (in) 62
Weight (lb): 110
BSA (m2): 1.48 m2
BP (mm Hg): 119/68
HR (bpm): 102
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2169-1-30**] at 11:50
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2168-10-25**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Moderate regional LV
systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus. Estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2).

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior -
hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferoseptal -
hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. [**Male First Name (un) 8**] of the mitral
chordae (normal variant). No resting LVOT gradient. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. Mild to moderate ([**12-30**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the septum and
anterior walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The estimated cardiac index
is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (LAD distribution). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-10-25**], left
ventricular systolic function is improved.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2166**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
