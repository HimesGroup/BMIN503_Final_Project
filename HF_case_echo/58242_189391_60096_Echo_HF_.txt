INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2203-10-5**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mildly depressed
LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: apex -
dyskinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No masses or
vegetations on aortic valve. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No masses or
vegetations on mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with mild to moderate global hypokinesis.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-5**], overall systolic
function is slightly worse and hypokinesis appears global. Severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased. Estimated pulmonary pressures are lower.
