"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function.  Shortness of breath.
Height: (in) 68
Weight (lb): 250
BSA (m2): 2.25 m2
BP (mm Hg): 111/60
HR (bpm): 101
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2120-3-13**] at 17:54
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2118-4-29**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal
inferoseptal - akinetic; basal inferior - akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic;
basal inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV systolic
function.

AORTIC VALVE: Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Moderate (2+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.

Conclusions:
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior,
inferolateral and basal inferoseptal severe hypokinesis/akinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation secondary to tethering and
restricted leaflet motion is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild
aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-4-29**], the findings are
similar. The overall LV ejection fraction was slightly OVERestimated on the
prior study given the extent of wall motion abnormalities.
