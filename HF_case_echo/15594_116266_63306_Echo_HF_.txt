"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Congestive heart failure. Coronary artery disease.
Height: (in) 68
Weight (lb): 137
BSA (m2): 1.74 m2
BP (mm Hg): 135/60
HR (bpm): 71
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2184-3-11**] at 10:16
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Low normal LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus. No
VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. Paradoxic septal
motion consistent with conduction abnormality/ventricular pacing.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch
coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Trivial MR. Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral E-wave
decel time. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality - poor apical
views. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%); the apex appears
hypokinetic. Due to suboptimal technical quality, another focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular contracrtile function
appears normal; there is abnormal septal activation suggestive of
intraventricular conduction delay. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-3-4**], no major change is evident.
