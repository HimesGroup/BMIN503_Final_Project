BSA (m2): 1.53 m2
BP (mm Hg): 140/66
HR (bpm): 91
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2149-9-4**] at 10:10
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Severely
depressed LVEF. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. Transmitral Doppler and
TVI c/w Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior -
hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferior - hypo;
mid inferolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo;
septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex -
dyskinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber size. Focal
apical hypokinesis of RV free wall.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. No
2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal tricuspid valve
supporting structures. No TS. Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.
Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive
apical hypokinesis, and dyskinesis of the true apex. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
