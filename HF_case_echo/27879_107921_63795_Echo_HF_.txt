Indication: Aortic valve disease. Left ventricular function. Preoperative assessment.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2149-4-1**] at 08:34
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic valve
leaflets. Systolic doming of aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS (AoVA
1.0-1.2cm2) Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets. Physiologic
(normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications.

Conclusions:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is systolic doming of the aortic valve leaflets.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well seated, well
functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is trace perivalvular
AI. MR remains mild. The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
