INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2179-5-7**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA
and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severely depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal
inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - akinetic; mid
inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral -
akinetic; basal anterolateral - akinetic; anterior apex - akinetic; septal
apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic; apex -
akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Normal RV chamber size. RV
function depressed.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. TR present -
cannot be quantified.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. No PS. No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion
cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF = 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior free wall, posterior wall,
lateral wall, and apex. The inferior septum is hypokinetic. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot
be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-5-7**], extensive
posterior wall and lateral wall akinesis are now present (contractile function
of these walls was relatively preserved in the prior study), associated with a
marked increase in the mitral regurgitation (previously mild).
