"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function. F/u effusion. Recent pacemaker with hypotension.
Height: (in) 76
Weight (lb): 254
BSA (m2): 2.45 m2
BP (mm Hg): 95/46
HR (bpm): 80
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2112-12-14**] at 12:14
Test: Portable TTE(Complete)
Doppler: Complete pulse and color flow
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is markedly dilated. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

LV WALL MOTION: The following resting regional left ventricular wall motion
abnormalities are seen: basal anterior - hypokinetic; mid anterior -
hypokinetic; basal anteroseptal - hypokinetic; mid anteroseptal - hypokinetic;
basal inferoseptal - hypokinetic; mid inferoseptal - hypokinetic; basal
inferior - akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - akinetic;
mid inferolateral - akinetic; basal anterolateral - hypokinetic; mid
anterolateral - hypokinetic; anterior apex - hypokinetic; septal apex -
hypokinetic; inferior apex - hypokinetic; lateral apex - hypokinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular cavity is dilated.

AORTA: The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate mitral annular calcification. There is mild thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

PERICARDIUM: There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include thinned and akinetic inferior and inferolateral segments
with hypokinesis elsewhere. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. The
aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion (partially echo-dense layering
posteriorly with a small rim anteriorly.) There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

Compared to prior study of [**2112-12-13**], pericardial effusion is now layering
posteriorly and is probably smaller.
