"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 176
BSA (m2): 1.98 m2
BP (mm Hg): 131/72
HR (bpm): 111
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2116-7-28**] at 12:00
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Severe global
LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views. Suboptimal image quality -
ventilator. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Resting tachycardia
(HR>100bpm). Compared to the findings of the prior study, left ventricular
systolic function has deteriorated.

Conclusions:
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with some preservation of basal posterior wall motion. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is a small pericardial effusion.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for
review) of [**2116-2-18**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
