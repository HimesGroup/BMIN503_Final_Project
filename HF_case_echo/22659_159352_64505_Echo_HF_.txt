"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Acute MI.  Coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 68
Weight (lb): 231
BSA (m2): 2.18 m2
BP (mm Hg): 90/70
HR (bpm): 125
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2193-2-8**] at 11:37
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)

Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Severely depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior -
hypo; mid anteroseptal - akinetic; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic;
lateral apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**12-17**]+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis, apical akinesis,
lateral hypokinesis, and anterior hypokinesis. No apical thrombus seen but
cannot exclude. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
