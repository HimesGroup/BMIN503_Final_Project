"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function. Right ventricular function. Valvular heart disease.
Height: (in) 65
Weight (lb): 185
BSA (m2): 1.92 m2
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2118-9-6**] at 10:13
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity. Moderately depressed
LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior -
hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
Pre Bypass:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 30%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with pressures 140 mm Hg
systolic. MR jet is central. Vena contracta goes from 5 mm at SBP 110 mm Hg to
7 mm at SBP 140 mm Hg. Reguritant volume by PISA 27 cc (HR 66, CO 4.5 L/min,
so Regurgitant fractioni 40%)

Post Bypass:

The patient is A -paced and an infusion of epinephrine. Biventricular function
is preserved. There is a mitral valve ring in situ. It appears well seated and
has mild residual regurgitation (vena contracta 3mm). The mean gradient was
2-4 mmHg across the mitral valve. The aorta is intact. The remainder of the
exam is unchanged.

Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 44**] was notified in person of the results intraoperatively.
