"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Pericardial effusion. Evaluate at 24 hrs s/p pericardiocentesis
Height: (in) 64
Weight (lb): 170
BSA (m2): 1.83 m2
BP (mm Hg): 108/40
HR (bpm): 92
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2115-3-8**] at 16:20
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Color doppler only
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral annular
calcification.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Compared with the findings of the prior study, there has
been no significant change. Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened.
3. There is a small pericardial effusion with very bright fibrin deposits over
the entire surface of the heart. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2115-3-7**], there has been no
significant change.
