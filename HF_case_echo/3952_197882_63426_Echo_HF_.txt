Indication: Left ventricular function. Right ventricular function. Shortness of breath.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2129-9-21**] at 17:27
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: No Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Focused transthoracic echo done during \"code blue\". Patient is bradycardic and
unresponsive. Images are unavailable to view on echo PAC system; Hand-held
device used.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened aortic valve
leaflets. No AS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study.

Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=10 %).
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no
pericardial effusion. Right ventricle is not best visualized but appears to
have moderate systolic dysfunction.

IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. At least moderate
right ventricular systolic dysfunction. No pericardial effusion.
