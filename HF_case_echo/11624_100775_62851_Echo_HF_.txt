"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 69
Weight (lb): 235
BSA (m2): 2.21 m2
BP (mm Hg): 120/70
HR (bpm): 71
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2147-1-6**] at 15:42
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe global LV hypokinesis.
Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
