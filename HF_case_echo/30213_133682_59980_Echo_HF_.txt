"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Congestive heart failure. Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 66
Weight (lb): 172
BSA (m2): 1.88 m2
BP (mm Hg): 125/64
HR (bpm): 53
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2129-6-14**] at 10:45
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images not
available) of [**2123-9-8**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal
anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral - hypo; septal apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic TR.
Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor suprasternal views.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral wall and
hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
coronary disease. Mild diastolic dysfunction.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2123-9-8**], the findings are similar.
