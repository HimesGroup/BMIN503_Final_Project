Indication: Endocarditis.
[** 16**]: (in) 67
Weight (lb): 130
BSA (m2): 1.69 m2
BP (mm Hg): 90/46
HR (bpm): 72
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2181-11-7**] at 11:30
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present. Left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Moderately depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**12-24**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets. Mild PR. The
end-diastolic PR velocity is increased c/w PA diastolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= XX %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation seen. Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity
with moderate global hypokinesis - the anterior wall and septum have the worst
function. Severe mitral regurgitation. Small ASD/stretched PFO present with
left to right shunting at rest.

In comparison to echo of [**2181-10-9**], degree of mitral regurgitation has
increased. Estimated pulmonary systolic pressures are significantly higher.
