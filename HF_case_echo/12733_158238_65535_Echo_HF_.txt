"1"	"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Chest pain. Coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function. Myocardial infarction. Right ventricular function. Shortness of breath.
BP (mm Hg): 65/33
HR (bpm): 95
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2193-7-4**] at 15:43
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Emergency echo during prolonged code in a patient with sepsis and NSTEMI.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe global LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Emergency study.
Results were personally reviewed with the MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal, with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Impression: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate
right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation.


Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 330**] was notified in person of the results at the time of the study.
