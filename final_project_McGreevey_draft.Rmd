Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, but this is not required.

### Overview
#Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.
Social determinants of health, such as inadequate housing, lack of access to reliable transportation, and insufficient food access, have increasingly been recognized as being factors that adversely impact health outcomes. In this project, with guidance from advisors John Holmes, PhD and Sameh Saleh, MD, I will attempt to determine if there is an observed association between low food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence in the United States for the most recent year for which data about both were available, 2015. I will use the AHRQ Social Determinants of Health dataset for this work.


### Introduction 
#Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

#Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.
Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem in the United States, with significant morbidity and mortality for the at least 33 million people who suffer with this condition. Additionally, the economic costs of type 2 diabetes in the aggregate are substantial, totaling $327 billion in 2017 (The Cost of Diabetes | ADA). Tragically, type 2 diabetes is largely a preventable disease that has modifiable risk factors (weight, diet, exercise). Increasingly, there has been recognition that social determinants of health can serve as barriers that prevent individuals from being able to successfully modify risk factors. For example, individuals who lack access to insurance and/or reliable transportation may not be able to seek routine medical care for education, prevention, monitoring, and treatment purposes. As noted, diet is a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. And while ideal diets to prevent type 2 diabetes have been advised, not every American necessarily has access to food to be able to consume these recommended diets. This is the phenomenon of food insecurity. Food insecurity is formally defined by the US Department of Agriculture as: “the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.” (USDA ERS - Measurement). One factor that can lead to lack of access to healthy foods is the phenomenon of food deserts – areas that are low income and that have few or no supermarkets or other sources of healthy food options. As formally defined by the USDA, a food desert is: “A census tract that meets both low-income and low-access criteria including: 1. poverty rate is greater than or equal to 20 percent OR median family income does not exceed 80 percent statewide (rural/urban) or metro-area (urban) median family income; 2. at least 500 people or 33 percent of the population located more than 1 mile (urban) or 10 miles (rural) from the nearest supermarket or large grocery store.” In the absence of options for healthy food, individuals residing in these communities may need to resort to convenience and fast foods for some or many of their meals. In doing so, they increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 

This project is interdisciplinary in that it combines census tract, geographical data with health survey data. Notably the AHRQ SDOH database integrates data from multiple surveys and sources. The fields and topics that contribute to understanding of this issue are multiple: public health, clinical medicine, sociology, health disparities, economics, geography, history (in that the reasons many communities have limited access to food involves historical structural decisions, including forms of structural racism such as redlining). Moreover, the findings of this project have social justice, ethical, cultural, economic, and political implications. Based on collaboration with my mentors, I have learned the importance of familiarizing myself with data sources and data definitions, notably the Data Source Documentation guide from AHRQ (AHRQ Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Database). This step is necessary from an exploratory standpoint to contemplate what kind of project I might do and also from a practical standpoint to understand how to properly and specifically answer my project question with the available data. I have also learned that some questions may be challenging to answer exactly as initially envisioned. For example, when considering this project at first, I had hoped to show changes over time in the association between limited food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence, perhaps including recent data from 2020 or 2021. However, after close inspection of this SDOH data set, I have realized that not all data is available for every year of interest. Thus I have needed to narrow the scope of my project a bit, given that data for limited food access and diabetes prevalence intersect in 2015, which is the most recent year that both types of data are available.

The identification of an independent association between low food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence would help support the case for policies and programs (both at the national and state levels) to improve food access in impacted census tracts. From a social justice standpoint, those with power in society (elected office holders, business and community leaders, members of the health care community including researchers) have a responsibility to seek ways to provide a known and effective preventive therapy (whether a vaccine or a grocery store) to those without such access currently, to prevent disease. There is also a national public health and cost dimension to this topic. People with diabetes suffer complications and morbidity related to diabetes, impairing their ability to support themselves, live independent lives, and contribute to a community’s economic activity and well-being. At the same time, the national cost of providing care for individuals with type 2 diabetes is borne by all Americans, in part because individuals living in low access food areas are more likely to have public (Medicaid, Medicare) insurance, if they have insurance at all, that is funded by all U.S. taxpayers. Indeed, Medicaid and Medicare combined provide health coverage to approximately 36% of Americans today and that percentage continues to rise over time. (Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population | KFF). Data Note: Three Findings about Access to Care and Health Outcomes in Medicaid (kff.org). “Uncompensated” care for individuals with type 2 diabetes who lack any type of insurance is also a cost borne by individual health care organizations, governments, and ultimately, tax payers. Greater awareness of the relationships between SDOH and health outcomes, combined with a blunt accounting of the costs of inaction on this subject, will hopefully spur actions that can help mitigate SDOH and improve both individual and community health. 


### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
