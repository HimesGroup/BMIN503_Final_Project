## BMIN503/EPID600 Project: Structural Brain Imaging Biomarker for Traumatic Brain Injury
### by Elizabeth Mamourian

Thank you for reviewing my project;      
In order to run the code, please download five files from the `https://github.com/mamourie/BMIN503_Final_Project/Data/`submodule 
   
1 "df_z_503.csv"      
2 "df_z_icv_503.csv"      
3 "df_z_ctrl_503.csv"      
4 "df_z_ctrl_icv_503.csv"      
5 "doc_MUSE_ROI_Dictionary.csv"       

Set the variable `home` to your local directory where those data files are saved.

At the beginning of the Rmd chunk in `final_project_template.Rmd` called `data_prep`, the variable called `fromBeginning` is set to FALSE.       
This allows you to view the code for data preparation, and also to run the code to visualize results, using the provided data files.
