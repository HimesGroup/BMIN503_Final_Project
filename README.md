# BMIN503_Final_Project
Repo for Data Science for Biomedical Informatics (BMIN503/EPID600) final project

This project is an analysis of data from the National Vital Statistics System containing provisional counts for drug overdose deaths. It includes data per state per month for the years 2015-2018. Some variables include total number of deaths, number of drug overdose deaths, and specifics about the category of drug for a subset of states.

Some of the analyses includes statistical analysis, graphical and geographical analysis and exploratory forecasting to show trends for each state over time.  The goal is to understand the extent and status of the opioid epidemic in the United States.

Additional files included in this repository are the geographic shape files from the US Census Bureau for the United States at the state level.
