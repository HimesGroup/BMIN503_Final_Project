# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project explores the gene expression difference between alveolar type 1-derived alveolar type 2 cells and other type alveolar 2 cells from genetically modified HopXCre R26Rtdtomato SPC-GFP mice which underwent neonatal hyperoxia injury. The motivation is to see which signaling pathways are involved in changing the cell fate of AT1 cells to AT2 cells so that we can manipulate these pathways to promote healing from neonatal lung injury such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The files present in this repository are: 

Final_Project_Wen.Rmd: R codes for the final project
Final_Project_Wen.html: html version of the final project
Lung_AT2_Alignment_QC_Report_star: folder which contains all the files needed for running the quality controls
Lung_AT2_desep2_out: folder which contains all the files needed for running the differential gene expression
files: folder which contains tables that are used for running alignment, quality control, and differential gene expression with linux commands
scripts: folder which contains scripts that are used for running alignment, quality control, and differential gene expression with linux commands
