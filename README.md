# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project - Adherence to AAP Acute Otitis Media Guidelines
Author: Jonathan Beus

This project examines adherence to treatment guidelines for antibiotic duration for [acute otitis media](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Middle-Ear-Infections.aspx) (common ear infection) for patients seen and discharged from our emergency department.

The included report is based on real data, but this project contains sample data as the original data cannot be shared due to the presence of patient identifiers.
