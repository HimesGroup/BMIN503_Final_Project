# Health Disparities Between Different Races in Philadelphia Region
## Joyce Wang
## BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Race influences many aspects of ones life from culture and lifestlye to health outcomes, especially between Caucasian people and minorities. I'm interested to see if these health disparities exist in the greater Philadelphia region and what factors are the greatest predictors of adverse health events. I will be applying statistical and machine learning analysis to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Survey results from 2015 to evaluate the difference between Caucasians and minorities.
