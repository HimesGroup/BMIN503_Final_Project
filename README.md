# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
This repository is for my final written report for BMIN503. Originally forked from [Final Project Repo](https://github.com/HimesGroup/BMIN503_Final_Project).

All data in this repo has been de-identified, there are no names present, and all dates have been shifted. 

# Introduction
This is the analysis of a dataset done on a small pilot study that I was involved with a few years ago. It involved a telemedicine intervention on children that were obese or had asthma. Monthly for 6 months we had online sessions with the children and their families where we gave them counseling and had virtual doctor's visits. Each month we would send the child and their parent a copy of the PedsQL Survey via REDCap, and then for the initial and final visit, we did a much more in-depth evaluation, using multiple other surveys.

# Outcomes
This was too small a study to claim true benfit. However, the restuls were encouraging.

It did seem to show for both children and their parents that their emotional health improved during this study. This might be the most important outcome of interventions such as this. Children's emotional well-being plays a role in all aspects of their life, their health, and their future, being able to improve this with a relatively short and minor intervention could have signficiant long-term benefits. 

Both children and their parents felt that they were more physically active after the study. Again, even if it's just the perception would be a reasonable outcome. We could argue it demonstrates that both child and parent understand the importance of physical activity, and are trying to it more.

The actual diet might have possibly changed, but we think this is actually a less important outcome. Eating healthier does not mean never having fast food, and if the patient did eat more fruits and vegetables, even if they ate more fast food, this would still have a beneficial impact.

The children's weight trajectories were unchanged during the study, and should not detract from any other findings. We understand more now that focusing on weight in children is almost always detrimental and should never be the focus of an intervention. If we were to repeat this study, we would put much less emphasis on this aspect.

Overall, we felt that our small pilot was successful, but certainly needs to be repeated on a larger to scale to show true demonstrable benefit.
