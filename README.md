# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This README file contains a brief summary of the project as well as paths to Excel data sets used.

Social determinants of health, such as inadequate housing, lack of access to reliable transportation, and insufficient food access, have increasingly been recognized as being factors that adversely impact health outcomes (https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health). In this project, I will attempt to determine if there is an observed association between low food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence in the United States for the most recent year for which data about both were available, 2015. It is possible that there is a positive association between decreased food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence, as individuals in low food access areas may have little choice but to rely on convenience foods and fast foods for their nutritional intake, which is likely to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. I will use the AHRQ Social Determinants of Health dataset for this work.
