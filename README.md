# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project: Using Childhood and Adulthood Stress Factors as Predictors for Tobacco/Nicotine Use

Katie Cardone

Cigarette smoking is a major health problem in the United States, as it is the leading cause of preventable death. Many family-related problems/stress have been associated with increased smoking individually, but this study considers whether the combination of these risk factors in a machine learning approach can better predict smoking. This study will leverage data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2022 survey, as this provides data on both family risk factors and nicotine use. This study integrates childhood and adulthood stress factor predictors in a random forest model and evaluates the model's effectiveness in predicting nicotine use status. The model modestly predicts non-nicotine use status. The most important predictors in the model are days of bad mental health in the past month, lived with an illicit substance user or prescription drug abuser in childhood, sex, and lived with an incarcerated adult in childhood.
