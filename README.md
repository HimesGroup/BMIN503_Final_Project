# Analysis of Obesity in the Philadelphia Region

The obesity epidemic in America is getting worse and current initiatives are not as effective as we'd hope. As of 2015-2016, about four in 10 U.S. adults were obese, up from 37.7 percent during 2013-2014. The news for children and teens isn’t much better. Overall, nearly 19 percent were obese in 2015-2016, up from about 17 percent during the previous two years. Obesity a serious concern because it’s a risk factor for many health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and even some kinds of cancer. Federal, state and local health policymakers need to continue campaigns that promote good nutrition and exercise, the food and beverage industry need to increase the supply of affordable, healthy, nutritious foods and fewer sugary drinks, and consumers need to demand healthier products and policies in their communities. I'm interested in looking at obesity in the Philadelphia region and used the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Survey results from 2015 to determine what factors are the greatest predictors for obesity in hopes of influencing health initiatives and directing effects to subpopulations that are affected the most.
