# EPID600 Final Project

Bernadette D'Alonzo

Project overview: Members of Penn Athletics, Penn Sports Medicine, and the Penn Injury Science Center are collaborating on a large study titled “Force Plate Analysis in Collegiate Athletes: An Epidemiologic and Injury Prevention Study,” to evaluate a program that has been active at Penn over the last 5 years. The overarching goal of that study is to investigate whether force plate measurements can predict injuries, and performance outcomes, and whether (and how) measurements vary across sports and sex. Exploring this may identify sport-specific profiles that may inform customized strength and conditioning injury prevention programs. The objective of this class project is to take a step back from prediction to first answer the question of whether and how these measurements vary between athletes from the same sport compared to within one athlete over time, and I examine this in the context of men’s lacrosse players. I use descriptive analyses and data visualization to explore and present the data in a meaningful way, and to aid in hypothesis generation. For this project, I worked with a large interdisciplinary team including: Dr. Doug Wiebe, Professor of Epidemiology and Director of the Penn Injury Science Center (PISC), Dr. Abby Bretzin, Postdoctoral Fellow at PISC, Dr. Jeremy Weeks, Associate Director of Penn Strength & Conditioning (and Director of Research), and Dr. Brian Sennett, Chair of Athletic Medicine at Penn.

The data utilized in this analysis were extracted from the Sparta Science platform and since they are part of a larger project, as discussed above, no data is made available on this repository.
