# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

My final project will be using the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey from 2018 to investigate the relationship between mental health outcomes and social predictors in adults living in Philadelphia County. 

Problem Addressed:
The problem I am focusing on is how the quality and perception of belonging in oneâ€™s neighborhood can be reflected in the occurrence of a mental disorder diagnosis and whether mental health treatment is sought out.

Dataset:
The dataset to be used is the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey from 2018. The 2018 survey was conducted during August 2018-January 2019, sampling 7,501 households in Southeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia County, Bucks County, Chester County, Delaware County, and Montgomery County). I will be focusing on only adult respondents. All of the variables used in this analysis are categorical. The mental health outcome variables are binary (yes/no), while social determinant and demographic variables have varying categorical values.
