# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

For my final project, I am looking at trends in the case counts and rates of [infectious diseases reported in California](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/infectious-diseases-by-disease-county-year-and-sex-d8912) from 2001 to 2021. California regulations require cases of [selected communicable diseases](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ReportableDiseases.pdf) to be reported (PDF) to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH); CDPH work with and local health departments to monitor cases and to identify, control, and prevent infections. I want to see if there is a increase in the number of diseases in the past two decades and more specifically identify which disease is becoming more frequent; Iâ€™d like to look at the spatial distribution of the diseases as well to identify potential hot spots. I spoke with two DBEI faculties (Quy Cao and Haochang Shou), as well as my coworker who is a wonderful data analyst. They provided valuable feedback on what to include and data visualizations, as well as asking questions that helped me dive a bit deeper into the dataset (e.g., doing more research on the diseases, identifying potential reasons for increasing cases, and etc).
