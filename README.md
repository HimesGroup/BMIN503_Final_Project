## "Determinants of liver disease"

The following repository contains the files necessary for assessment for evaluation of the determinants of liver disease using the NHANES database. Using demographic, physical exam and Fibroscan data from the NHANES data base, phenotypes were created for hepatic steatosis and hepatic cirrhosis. This was followed by exploratory and inferential analyses to identify independent variables contributing to each phenotype. Machine learning models were then created (Supervised-Random Forest and Unsupervised- K-Means Clustering) to predict the occurrence of the phenotypes and identify clusters which with possible enrichment of each phenotype. The following are the files that have been used for this repository

1)  README.md : readme file with instructions to navigate the repo

2)  final_project_MUKHERJEE.html : html version of the final code + plots

3)  final_project_MUKHERJEE.qmd: Quarto document with code chunks

4)  Data files (ending in "XPT"): The raw data files (downloaded from NHANES) have also been included in the repo with the key as follows:

    a\. "P_DEMO.XPT": demographic data

    b\. "P_HEQ.XPT": hepatitis lab data

    c\. "P_BIOPRO.XPT" : biochemical lab data

    d\. "P_DIQ.XPT" : Diabetes questionnaire data

    e\. "P_GHB.XPT" : Hemoglobin A1c levels

    f\. "P_HEPBD.XPT": Hepatitis B+ patient data

    g\. "P_HEPC.XPT": Hepatitis C+ patient data

    h\. "P_LUX.XPT": Fibroscan data

    i\. "P_HIQ.XPT": insurance data

    j\. "P_ALQ.XPT": Alcohol data

    k\. "P_BMX.XPT": body measurements data
