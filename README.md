# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

My final project will be predicting bike demand in the city of Philadelphia using Indego's bike share data. Indego is Philadelphia's leading bike share company that allows people to rent and drop off bikes at any various stations throughout the city. Data is collected on time of rental, duration of rental, time of drop-off, location of rental and drop-off, weather and much more. Being able to accuractely predict bike demand will allow Indego's leadership to more accurately deploy new bikes or recall existing bikes when necessary. This, in turn, will help Indego realize better business outcomes. 

Files present in the repository will include the final .rmd and .html files, as well as the dataset used to make the algorithms and predictions. Data sets were obtained from Indego's leadership team.
