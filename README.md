# nsong1/BMIN503_Final_Project

This is Nianfu Song's Repo for the Final Project of BMIN503/EPID600 Data Science for Biomedical Informatics 

This project contains a R markdown file (.Rmd) and a HTML file produced by the markdown file. The .Rmd file can be run independently. Data will be retrieved by the code chunks of the .Rmd from the CDC website. it may take some time to completely run the code. Please be patient to wait for the results.  The HTML file may be incomplete because it is too large to upload to Github. There are a total 11 sections. You are welcome to use any sections of the code. These files represent the analyses of the National Health Survey Data 2018 for the relationships between some chronic diseases and some measures of activities and life style of US adults. Risk prediction models are estimated and the predictions can be used to assess the risk of patients. 

This project feathers heatmaps that represent the significance of logistic and rare event logistic estimates. The rare event logistic models are theoratically better in representing the correlations between covariates and the selected chronic diseases, some of which are rare events. 

Please be aware that the resulted correlations do not represent causality. However, these correlations could be candidate causes in risks analysese of diseases. Please be cautious about the high sensitivity of the prediction at some point of the ROC, because low precision is a company of the high sensitivity. The highest F-score of the prediction often occures at low sensitivity because of the unbalanced ocurrances of disease and non-disease. 

Thank you for your interest and please leave your comments.
