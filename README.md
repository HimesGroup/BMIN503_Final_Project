# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Hello :) This repository it for my final project for BMIN503 Data Science course. 

## Project Overview
Sepsis is among the leading causes of hospital readmissions, and survivors often experience long-term consequences. Research has shown that home health services can improve the outcomes of sepsis survivors, reducing the likelihood of hospital readmission. This project aims to identify the patient/clinical characteristics that are associated with sepsis survivors' discharge dispositions (home or home with home health care) and 30-day rehospitalization using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) data, which is a publicly accessible and deidentified data.

## Aims
(1) Describe and compare patient characteristics (i.e., demographic and clinical characteristics) and 30-day readmission rates between older sepsis survivors discharged home with HHC and without HHC
(2) Determine the risk factors associated with 30-day readmission.
