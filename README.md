# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains my final written report project for Data Science for
Biomedical Informatics (BMIN503/EPID600). 

What the project does:
The project uses data imported from ClinEpiDB, a clinical epidemiology database 
to assess difference in preterm mortality by region in Ethiopia. 
The data used is a longitudinal cohort study of preterm birth outcomes conducted 
in three different regions in Ethiopia: Oromia region, the Amhara region, and 
the capital, Addis Ababa.Preterm infants <7 days old were enrolled and followed 
over the first 28 days of life or until death.
