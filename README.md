# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

## Current State
Currently this project is a work in progress. At this point the data files have nearly all been gathered. Data from both the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and CDC Wonder has been necessary to build the anticipated data frames to investigate the changing nature of death in infancy across the United States.

- NBER provides linked birth and death certificate data from 1993 through 2013.
- CDC Wonder provides a multitude of custom queries available as tab deliminited downloads 

## Varaibles
There is a separate description of the variables used by year cohort.
