# EPID600 Final Project: Modelling rabies dynamics in Arequipa, Peru
#### Brinkley Raynor
#### December 11, 2020

This repository contains code used to parameterize and construct a mathematical SEIR model (deterministic and stochastic) to investigate rabies dynamics in Arequipa, Peru. In addition, included in the code is an example using the epidemiologic models to investigate rabies control strategies in the face of COVID-19 restrictions. 

This repo contains:

1. Raynor_FinalProject.Rmd: An R markdown file containing code, comments and explanation of project
2. Raynor_FinalProject.html: a polished print out of the R markdown file
3. VSEI_ModelFramework.png: An image file pulled into the final report (Raynor_FinalProject.Rmd)

NOT INCLUDED:
Date used to parameterize models is not included due to containing protected information. 

Any questions on code, please contact me (Brinkley Raynor) at bhraynor@vet.upenn.edu
