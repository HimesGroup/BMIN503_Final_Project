# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project: Predicting Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogens at a Veterinary Hospital

This repository contains my final project for EPID600.  The final_project_template.rmd file contains the code and accomanying text introducing my topic, describing the data source, and the analysis. At this point, the data has been cleaned and initial analyses have been started. My plan is to use random forest analysis to develop a predictive model for admissions during which a canine patient will be flagged for multi-drug resistant bacteria. Because this event is so rare (occuring in only about 1% of admissions) but so serious, I will also be evaluating four methods to handle the imbalance of cases and controls: undersampling controls, oversampling cases, both, and using synthetic sampling techniques.   

Due to the sensitive nature of the specific data, it has not been uploaded to git.  I hope to be able to generate a fake dataset to show how the models perform. 


DUE DATE FOR FINAL VERSION: 12/8/17 11:59PM. This is a hard deadline. Turn in whatever you have by this date.
