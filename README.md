# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
## Student Alcohol Consumption Project

This is a R script used to solve the student alcohol consumption problem provided in [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption)

## Introduction
Despite laws banning teenagers from drinking alcohol until they are adults, teenage binge drinking is still a common problem. This study was designed to see if drinking alcohol among teenagers had any adverse effects on them.

The data were obtained in a survey of students math and Portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students, especially their alcohol consumption. I would like to use it for finding out the most important factor that related to the students final grade. To see if teen binge drinking has a negative impact on their learning performance. And create a prediction model to predict the student's final score. This problem is related to education, statistic and computer science. Solving it needs a clear and thorough understanding about semantics, regression model as well as solid programming skills. I will apply multiple regression models that we learned in this course and rigorous data pre-processing, multifaceted validation to get a persuasive result.

- G3 : final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)

Additional note: there are several (382) students that belong to both datasets . 
These students can be identified by searching for identical attributes
that characterize each student, as shown in the annexed R file.
