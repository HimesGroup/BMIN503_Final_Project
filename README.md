# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
These are the materials for my data science final project, in which I clean, process, and perform exploratory analysis on my respondent survey dataset collected from Jan-Sep 2023. This work seeks to: a) define two cohorts - VCUG and control; b) perform EDA to inform whether the sample collected allows for statistical analysis between the VCUG and control groups; and c) perform chosen analyses on both groups to assess trends between the two. 

**Note on data source:**
This survey was distributed and collected using REDCap. To preserve respondent confidentiality, I will not upload the raw data file to GitHub. I will, however, include the data dictionary and the recruitment flyer/IRB approval form. The raw (de-identified) data file is available upon request, only to those who require access for the purposes of validating the project and/or study.
