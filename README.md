# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This is an exploratory analysis of the relationship between substance use disorder(SUD) and mental health issues(MHI) in the adult population of the united states using data from the 2021 NSDUH survey.

According to the World Health Organization(WHO), mental health issues have risen 13% over the past ten years. (put statistic about comorbidity and  SUD). The relationship between SUD and MHI can often be hard to study because symptoms may overlap and one disorder may be the root-cause of or greatly exacerbating the other. Furthermore, if someone is suspected to have SUD along with MHI, treatment can become more complex and will require careful care to make sure both disorders are addressed appropriately for lasting recovery. Many people with both MHI and SUD have used substances as a way to self-medicate the MHI progressing into SUD. If someone in this case is treated for SUD but not MHI, they may still feel they are suffering and may be likely to return to using substances. Conversely, SUD shares many symptoms of MHI including lethargy, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, missing work or school and increased spending habits that may cause someone to be misdiagnosed with MHI leaving the SUD untreated and leading to dire consequences in personal life and health.
