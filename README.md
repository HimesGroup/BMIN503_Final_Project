# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Hi there! My name is Jessica Wong. 

Welcome to my GitHub repository. 

This is my README file.

My qmd file is final_project_WONG.qmd.

My final project report can be reviewed at final_project_WONG.html.

Here is an overview of my project:

While hypertension disorders are not typically considered a known risk factor for vascular nevi, several studies have suggested a potential association. In particular, conditions like preeclampsia, often linked to in utero hypoxic environments, have been explored for their potential impact on the relative risks of vascular nevi. However, the findings have been somewhat inconsistent, with some studies indicating an association and others showing little to no link. This project seeks to investigate how the relative risks of vascular nevi, specifically infantile hemangiomas and port wine stains, vary based on different definitions of hypertension, ranging from contemporary to historical definitions. The relevance of this study lies in the fact that the dataset originates from the 1950s, and it raises intriguing questions about how relative risks might have been interpreted if this same study had been conducted during that era. Given the evolution of diagnostic criteria, particularly for conditions like preeclampsia, this study aims to demonstrate how using different definitions can significantly influence the results of risk assessment. It underscores the importance of keeping diagnostic criteria up-to-date to ensure accurate risk assessments, particularly for rare outcomes like vascular nevi.
