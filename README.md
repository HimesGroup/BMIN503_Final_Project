# Unsupervised discovery of leukemogenesis-cooperating genes in *de novo* acute myeloid leukemia

**Osvaldo D. Rivera**: Cancer Biology Graduate Student: Biomedical Graduate Studies

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rapidly progressing hematopoietic malignancy categorized by its high heterogeneity and considerable molecular diversity. The goal of this project is to explore gene expression profiles of AML patients with the intent of subtype classification and clinical outcome stratification using clustering and feature selection algorithms. I hypothesize that the differential expression of key genes characterize the stratification of subtype-specific gene expression profiles, potentially leading to diverse clinical outcomes.

This repository contains the code and files necesarry to run this project.
