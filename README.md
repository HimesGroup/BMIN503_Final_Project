This project seeks to determine the effect of eating a meal at home vs away from home on sodium consumed at that meal, and seeks to untangle the interaction effects of day type (weekend vs weekday) and meal source (premade food vs non-premade food) on that effect.

A detailed discussion of the motivation, methods, and results for this project as well as the code can be found in final_project.html. The raw data comprises DR1IFF.xpt and DR2IFF.xpt, with WWEIA1516_foodcat_FNDDS.xlsx included as a reference for looking up full descriptions of foods that correspond to the food codes given in the raw data.

Plots illustrating the methods used in the analysis are also included in this repo.
