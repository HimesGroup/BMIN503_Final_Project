# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains my final project about Castleman disease. Below you will find the project overview. 

Castleman disease is a rare disease characterized by lymph node enlargement, specific microscopic changes to the lymph nodes, and a broad range of symptoms and laboratory findings. Unfortunately, there has not been much of an effort historically to collaborate on Castleman disease research. However, more recently, the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN) has made strides in the research due to the implementation of a biobank and a medical record registry. In 2013 the CDCN initiated a medical record registry to promote the study of Castleman disease. This registry, called ACCELERATE (Advancing Castleman Care with an Electronic Longitudinal Registry, E-Repository, and Treatment/Effectiveness research) collects real-world demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcomes data on patients with Castleman disease. Currently, the registry has around 700 patients who have partially or fully completed the enrollment process. 

This repo contains the QMD and HTML files surrounding some exploratory research on the enrollment of this registry.
