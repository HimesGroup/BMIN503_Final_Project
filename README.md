# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository includes files for analyzing TCGA RNA sequencing data for hepatocellular carcinoma.

TCGA_LIHC_RNAseq_normalized_counts_DESeq2_vst.txt: A dataframe generated by Jingya Qui.  She downloaded the HTseq Counts data from Genomic Data Commons portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) 4/10/2019.  GDC portal downloads each patient to its own repository so Jingya extracted each file and imported all into a dataframe (genes x file ID).  She then used DESeq2 to normalize all data.

ISG.RS.txt: List of genes by HGNC name in interferon-target resistance signature (Weichselbaum, et al. PNAS, 2009)
IFNG.GS.txt: List of genes by HGNC name in interferon-target immunotherapy response signatures (Benci et al. Cell, 2019)

Final_project_template.Rmd: takes TCGA normalized RNA count dataframe, converts rownames to patient UUID to correlated with metadata file.  Examines ISG.RS and IFNG.GS gene sets.
