# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains files for my final project for BMIN5030/EPID6000: Data Science for Biomedical Informatics.

##Overview

Season influenza viruses continues to be a major global burden. There are around a billion cases annually and up to 650,000 people die of influenza. Influenza activity patterns vary geographically and temporally, so we want to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity in the United States and determine if variations in influenza activities across states or regions are associated with distribution of circulating virus strains. I will be using surveillance data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and viral sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GIDSAID) to answer these questions. Understanding patterns of seasonal influenza activity can help guide early influenza surveillance and inform influenza prevention and control programs.
