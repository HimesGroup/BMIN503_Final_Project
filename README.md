# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains files for BMIN 503 Final Project for Heather Wachtel, for my project entitled: "Succinate dehydrogenase mutations: penetrance and oncologic associations."

Included files include the .rmd and .html files showing the introduction, methods, results and conclusion.  The data utilized in the analysis is under material transfer agreement, and therefore I unfortunately cannot share the original data files.
