# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project


Author: Chris Wirtalla


Included in this repo is a .RMD file to run my final project which looks at the Association of Surgical Utilization at the County Level with Presidential Election Results from 2012 & 2016.  
Instructions for how to download and save the data used in the project is embedded in the .RMD/HTML files.  
I also used Zotero for References which I will attempt to add into the repo ASAP.
