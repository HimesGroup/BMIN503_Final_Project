# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project: Air Quality in American Communities

These are the materials for my project building models from census data to determine how well they predict air quality and its health effects.

Contents: 
- final_project_Bayes.Rmd:  RMarkdown file to run and generate the report
- final_project_Bayes.html: The report itself
- all2019dailyPM25.RDS:     The 2019 file with daily PM2.5 EPA data for the "lower 48" states.

The .RDS file would also be produced by the R chunk near the start of the RMarkdown file; however, it typically takes 1-2 hours to execute, and it requires that the user (1) possess active credentials for the EPA Air Quality System API and (2) has them stored them as appropriately-named environment variables.

Notes to self:
DUE DATE FOR FINAL VERSION: 12/11/20 11:59PM. This is a hard deadline. Turn in whatever you have by this date.
**Create a pull request on the original BMIN503_Final_Project repository to turn in your final project.**
