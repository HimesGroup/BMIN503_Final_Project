# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains Zihe Zheng's final written report and GitHub repository. Files presented includes the final report's RMD file, the knited html file, and an example dataset. 

For the protection of human subject data, the example data set provided is a simulated data set with randomized variable values. Thus, the result got from running the RMD file on the example dataset is going to be different than the results shown in the knited file.
