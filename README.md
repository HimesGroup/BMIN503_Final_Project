# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains my final written report for the Data Science for Biomedical Informatics (BMIN 503/EPID 600) final project. 

This project develops a maternal health outcome specific neighborhood stressor index. It includes ACS data as well as clinical data for maternal delivery outcomes, such as hemmoraghing and amniotic fluid embolism. 

Some of the methods include a logistic regression model with a lasso penalty on the predictors for creating the neighborhood stress index. 
Additionaly descriptive analyses including descriptive statistical analysis, graphical and geographical analysis were all used. The goal is to understand what neighborhood factors predict poor maternal health in Philadelphia.
