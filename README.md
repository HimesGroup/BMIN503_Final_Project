# EPID600 Final Project

## Overview

This repository comprises the documentation and code for my final project in the EPID600 class. Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset, I sought to make early predictions about death or prolonged ICU stay among hospitalized patients. I compared the performance of "traditional" GLM methods with that of "new" machine learning methods, and looked at the marginal improvement in model performance with the addition of featured derived from unstructured text in clinical notes.

Important files here include:

* __final_project_template.Rmd__ which contains the narrative and code for the data cleaning and analysis
* __text_analysis_main.py__ provides the Python code for the text-analysis portion of the analysis.
