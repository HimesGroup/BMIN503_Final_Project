### By: Sameh Saleh

## Overview
Breakthrough COVID-19 infections in fully vaccinated individuals have been reported. The goal of this project is to assess clinical outcomes in partially or fully vaccinated (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) patients with subsequent breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare them to unvaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This retrospective study uses data from the Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset of nearly 7 million patients nationwide.
