**Project Title**: Serum Amyloid A promotes Th17 responses in murine models of colitis and multiple sclerosis

# Overview
Using the publically available RNASeq dataset [GSE132761]("https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.library.upenn.edu/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132761") from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository, my goal was to understand transcriptomic changes in naive CD4 T cells in response to the acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA).

# Introduction
I am interested in understanding inflammatory pathways common to both obesity and asthma. As a graduate student in the Immunology Graduate Group (IGG), my research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of immunological and metabolic dysregulation in pediatric patients with obese asthma (OA). OA is unique disease entity at the intersect of the two most commonly occurring chronic inflammatory disorders in children. Both adults and children with OA experience increased frequency and severity of asthma exacerbation and are typically refractory to treatment. While there is an overwhelming amount or research that the two inflammatory disorders are closely *associated*, the *mechanistic relationship* between asthma and obesity is yet to be determined. 

There is a limited number of studies that attempt to elucidate the pathophysiological link between asthma and obesity in children. Most studies focus instead on adult cohorts or on animal models of the disease. Given this, I chose to learn more about the complex inflammatory pathways e a [publically available data set]("https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.library.upenn.edu/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132761") that focuses on immune mediators common to both asthma and obesity. This dataset is included in a Cell paper[https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.library.upenn.edu/31866067/] published earlier this year by the Littman lab. The authors found the acute-phase response protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA) altered CD4+ T cell differentiation patterns to a pathogenic Th17 phenotype in mouse models of colitis and multiple sclerosis. They show that the pathogenic pro-inflammatory Th17 program induced by SAA is distinct from other well-established signaling pathways known to drive Th17 differentiation. 

I chose this data set because SAA is associated with increased risk of asthma incidence and increased risk of obesity. Moreover, because Th17 cells are the major effector cells in severe, treatment resistant asthma, I was especially excited to find this paper. 
My final project focuses on transcriptomic
