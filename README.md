# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project seeks to analyze trends in worldwide vaccination coverage and incidence of those disease in various countries. Specifically, I want to explicitly arrive at the conclusion that the increase in vaccination coverage is certainly correlated with the decrease in incidence of those diseases around the world. In reality however, many less developed countries struggle to maintain low incidence of those diseases, even with increasing vaccination coverage. Some diseases have also seen an increase in incidence in more developed countries, perhaps due to stagnating coverage. 

The files included in this project are worldwide vaccination coverages per country for various infectious diseases, as well as the worldwide incidence of those diseases on a per country basis. These data were obtained by WHO/Unicef estimates, and may or may not be what is actually true (we are only going by reported incidence and reported coverage). As a case study, we also take some microarray and sequencing data of a subject who has contracted ebola to investigate what sorts of responses are elicited from this pathogenesis on a genetic or epigenetic level.
