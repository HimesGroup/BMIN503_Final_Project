# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

## Project Overview
Final Project Introduction: This final project aims to look at how health system factors may contribute to subconscious bias towards pregnant individuals based on their health status.

This repository contains a qmd of my code, and an html output. I am still working on my introduction and background.My analysis is done though I am still looking for ways to improve the visualizations of models and plots so that they are easily interpreted. I appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you!
