Introduction

Pima Indians of Arizona have an extremely high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and DKD. Genetically related Pima Indians living in Mexico, whose lifestyle remains traditional, have a much lower prevalence of these morbidities. The differences in lifestyle indicate that environmental factors play an important role in disease origins and suggest involvement of epigenetic programming. We analyzed cytosine methylation (5mC) changes in Pima Indians from Arizona.

Methods

A nested case control study was conducted in 327 Pima Indians (205 women, 122 men) selected from a longitudinal cohort. DNA methylation from peripheral blood leukocytes was analyzed on an Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 Beadchip. Preprocessing and Quality Control were performed using Minfi Package, normalization was performed using BMIQ. Methylation changes were expressed transformed to M values. Covariates included age, sex, duration of diabetes, mean blood pressure, HbA1c, genotype, batch, cell count and conversion efficiency. P-values were corrected for multiple comparison
