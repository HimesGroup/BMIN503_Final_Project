# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains files for my final written report and GitHub repository. My final project is entitled, "Predictors of Acute Renal Failure Post-Heart Transplantation: A UNOS Analysis: BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project." The objective of this project is to derive and internally validate a clinical prediction model for postoperative acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy in heart transplant recipients during the index transplantation hospitalization that can be deployed at the time a patient undergoes heart transplantation. The primary data source for this project will be The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, a registry containing patient-level data on all solid organ transplants performed in the United States. 

This repository contains my final project Rproj file, Rmd file, HTML file, and Rmd template file. UNOS data are not uploaded here for privacy reasons.
