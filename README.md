# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Nawar Naseer's Repo for BMIN503/EPID600 Data Science for Biomedical Informatics Final Project

This project contains spatial analysis of selected variables extracted from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Environment Atlas. This report contains several maps of the United States, including food insecurity rate, use of government food assistance programs such as SNAP and WIC, and health outcomes such as diabetes and obesity. The goal of this project is to understand how the food retail environment varies across space and to assess the relationship between food access and other indicators such as race, income, food assistance, and health outcomes variables.

Files included in this repository include the USDA dataset, an R markdown file of the main project report, an html document of the main project report,  an additional R markdown file containing extra code chunks and graphics not incorporated in the final report, and exported PNG files of various maps and graphs generated within the main project report.
