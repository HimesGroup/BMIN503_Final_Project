# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

## Objective
To investigate the temporal trends among VLBW abd ELBW infants in the amount of time before death for those infants that die in infancy.
## Current State
The work continues to be in evolution. Data from both the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and CDC Wonder has been necessary to build the anticipated data frames to investigate the changing nature of death in infancy across the United States.

- NBER provides linked birth and death certificate data from 1995 through 2013.
- CDC Wonder provides a multitude of custom queries available as tab deliminited downloads. Multiple test queries were performed resulting in the data tables that came into eventual use. Most important were Wonder files used to interogate the changing nature of timing of death in infancy as well the difference in 

## Variables
There is a separate description of the variables used by year cohort.

## Current Findings.

- Through 2007 in VLBW infants time to death in infancy was extending.
- From 2007 through 2013 the time to death has fallen.
- Much of the US infant mortality rate is contributed to by VLBW and ELBW infants.
- It appears there are racial diffierences in time to death in infancy in infants born VLBW.
