This project focuses on Car Crashes in Philadelphia in 2008 and 2018. The project obtains the crash dataset from Pennsylvania Crash Information Tool (PCIT), and focuses on Philadelphia crashes dataset in the year of 2008 and 2018.The goal is to examine car crash data in Philadelphia in 2008 and 2018, respectively. This project will first obtain important objective factors related to crashes. This project will then obtain and compare the critical factors contributing the fatal or major injury resulting car crashes in 2008 and 2018 using machine learning methods (random forest and logistic regression).

Files included in this repository include the 2008 and 2018 datasets (each year have both flag and crash excel files), an R markdown file of the main project report, an html document of the main project report, a data dictionary file that includes the description of the datasets and exported PNG/tiff files of various graphs generated within the main project report.
