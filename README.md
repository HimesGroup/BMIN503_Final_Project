# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project seeks to explore next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) testing rates and patterns, testing modalities, and receipt of guideline concordant care among 552 patients with stage IV mNSq NSCLC using electronic health record (EHR)-extracted data. A primary aim of this project is to identify if there are any predictors of receiving guideline concordant care, particularly in relation to test modality, comprehensiveness, prior to 1L, and other demographic characteristics. Here is a link to the working draft of [my GitHub project](https://github.com/amartella1/BMIN503_Final_Project). Here is the [HTML](file:///C:/Users/martelan/OneDrive%20-%20Penn%20Medicine/Documents/GitHub/BMIN503_Final_Project/Martella_final_project_template.html).

\*Methods and Results sections are still being finalized, including data visualization. **I am open to feedback on types of visualizations that might be compelling.**

The GitHub repository will contain:

1.  QMD document with a report, including necessary code to perform analyses and plot visualizations

2.  HTML document of the project

3.  A data dictionary for the variables used
