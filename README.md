This is the repository for the final project in BMIN5030/EPID6000: Data Science for Biomedical Informatics.

Overview of Project
This project utilized mammography and MRI screening data from Penn Medicine to produce tables, graphs, and regression models examining differences in supplemental MRI screening utilization by race. 

The goal of this project was to use data from Penn Medicine to see if the proportion of high risk Black and White women who utilize supplemental breast cancer screening is similar, and whether the utilization differs by other factors such as family history of breast cancer and breast density.
