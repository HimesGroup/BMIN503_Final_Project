# BMIN503 Final Project: Predicting Viable Stem Cells after Freeze-Thaw

This repository contains the files for my final written report. 

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are generally thought of as resistant to freeze-thaw cycles, however we found that post-thaw viability of stem cells varies widely. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict post-thaw HSC viability.

The following files are in this repository:

1. README.md - this file
2. data/cd34.csv - the data for this study
3. Final_Project.Rmd - the source code of the written report in R Markdown format
4. Final_Project.html - the final report knitted to HTML
5. BMIN503_Final_Project.Rproj - an R Project file for this project / repo
6. 202112203 BMIN503 Final Presentation.pptx - slides describing the analysis in this project
