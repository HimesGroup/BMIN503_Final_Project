# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project is aimed at looking at aggregate economic factors such as median household income, food and housing costs, and comparing them to indivdual health outcomes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. For this project, I explore county-level income, housing, and food expense data using data from American Community Survey, Housing and Urban Development, and Feeding America Research. I make exploratory visualizations before analyzing how individual demographics along with metropolitan data might be associatd with general health, and a history of COPD and/or depression. This repo contains CPI and food cost data in .csv format. ACS data was queried using tidycensus, and BRFSS data was downloaded from https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/smart/Smart_data.htm. 

Data sources are listed in data_sources.txt file.
