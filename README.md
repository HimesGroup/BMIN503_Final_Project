# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
This repository currently contains the main project file of the BMIN 503 Final Project. The corresponding dataset will be uploaded later as the progress has been made through the thanksgiving holiday. Current version of the main project file contains the Overview, Introduction, a draft of the functions and the structure of the overall projects. Current assumption for the result is, the company with more products requiring in-patient care are more likely to demonstrate lower impact due to the increasing covid 19 cases and with the vaccination rate increase, the stock price will increase.
