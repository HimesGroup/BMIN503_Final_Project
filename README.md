# Andi Fu BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains files for my final project relating to looking at trend in psychiatric emergencies that present to the CHOP Emergency room, in anticipation of using that information to help inform staffing of a new pediatric psychiatry crisis center. 

The data from January 1 2021 until November 17, 2023 is pulled from Chop's dataware house, cleaned, and stripped of any PHI and saved as a csv. The data is then analyzed to look at trends in volume of visits per month, day of the week, and hour, as well as trends in most popular disposition recommendations, diagnoses, and statistics on length of stay. 

The repo contains a qmd file and that's file's rendered html file, in addition to this Readme.

The csv file itself is not uploaded due my wanting to be cautious with CHOP data despite it all being de-identified.
