# Predicting Screening Coagulation Studies Using Coagulation Factor Results

### By Amrom Obstfeld

## Overview
The interpretation of coagulation studies in clinical practice can be hampered by lack of understanding of the relationship between screening coagulation studies and followup coagulation factor results that are ordered in order to expain abnormalities in these studies. In order to allucidate these relationships I will acquire deideintified laboratory results from CHOP and HUP data warehouses and use statistical and machine learning tools. My ultimate goal is to use these tools in clinical practice to guide clinicians towards appropriate coagulation tests.
