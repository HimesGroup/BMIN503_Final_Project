#What this project is about
This project seeks to characterize various aspects of forearm bone density development during childhood. The specific phenotype we are concentrating on is ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD). UD radius aBMD has yet to be characterized during the rapidly growing years, so its utility in research and clinical practice is uncertain. Herein, we assess critical fundimental research questions before this particular measure can be used for further questioning. Our objectives include characterizing changes in UD radius bone density during childhood, and any race or sex differences; determining whether UD radius aBMD is reflective of cortical or trabecular bone size or volumetric density, and identify any sex-differences in these relationships; understand whether forearm bone density is confounded by stature; and finally, determine whether UD radius aBMD is reflective of fracture history. This work will provide the essential foundational knowledge needed to utilize this measure in subsequent studies involving the role of diet, physical activity, chronic disease, and genetics on forearm bone density in the present cohort (i.e., the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study) and other clinical populations.
