# Characterizing Air Quality in Philadelphia
This repository contains files pertaining to the project that aims at characterizing air quality quantified by PM 2.5 levels in the city of Philadelphia. The study takes on  a graphical and analytical approach in analysing the relationships between air quality and a variety of pamareters like Temperature, Humidity, Time of Day, Sound Levels and Geo-spacial coordinates. 

The two main files that are needed to reproduce the results: 
1. data_processing.py : To transorm the raw CSV files into more manageable format
2. Final_Project_name.RMD: R code that is used to analyse the Air Quality data.
