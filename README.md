## BMIN503/EPID600 Project: Structural Brain Imaging Biomarker for Traumatic Brain Injury
### by Elizabeth Mamourian

Thank you for reviewing my project;      
In order to run the code, please download 4 data files:      
1 "df_z.csv"      
2 "df.z.icv"      
3 "df.z_ctrl"      
4 "df.z_ctrl.icv"      

Set the variable `home` to the local directory where those data files are saved.

At the beginning of the Rmd chunk called `data_prep`, the variable called `fromBeginning` is set to FALSE.       
This allows you to review the code for data preparation, and later plot the results using the provided data files.
