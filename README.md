# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project seeks to explore next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) testing rates, modalities (tissue, plasma, or both), and receipt of guideline concordant care among 552 patients with stage IV mNSq NSCLC using electronic health record (EHR)-extracted data. Receipt of guideline-concordant care will be looked at in relation to test modality, comprehensiveness, availability of results prior to 1L therapy, and other demographic characteristics. Secondary analyses will examine testing turn-around-time (TAT) of results by test modality, time-to-treatment (TTT) differences by test modality, and most commonly identified alterations. The contents of this project are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/amartella1/BMIN503_Final_Project).
