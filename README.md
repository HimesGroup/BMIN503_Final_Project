# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains SQL code as well as R Markdown file /analytic code for a project analyzing cardiology consults at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from March 2017-November 2019.

My project aims to examine patterns of consultation of the cardiovascular medicine consult service since the implementation of the PennChart EHR in March 2017.  The purpose of doing this is to inform staffing for this service, particularly with an advanced practice provider, going forward as we move into HUP East/New Patient Pavilion (new patient hospital).

The data being used to complete the project are exclusively extracted from the Penn Medicine Epic/PennChart Clarity enterprise data warehouse.  We queried a number of tables throughout Clarity including those holding information on patient demographics, hospitalizations, medical history, problem list, visit/encounter diagnoses, inpatient consultation/procedure orders, and primary/secondary teams following patients during thier hospitalization.  We have data on patients admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from March 4th, 2017 (date of inpatient go-live) through November 2019.  

Additionally, these data are supplemented by queries from the Epic/PennChart tool SlicerDicer which draws information from the Caboodle data warehouse.
