## BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project [Balcarcel]

# Predicting Pediatric ARDS Subphenotypes using Machine Learning

# Overview
This project focuses on developing and validating machine learning models to predict biomarker-based Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Subphenotypes using clinical data available in electronic health records (EHR). The goal is to evaluate the performance of various supervised machine learning techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, neural networks, and XGBoost, and compare their effectiveness in accurately predicting ARDS subphenotypes.
