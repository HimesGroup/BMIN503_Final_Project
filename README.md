# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains files for my final project which examines patient and visit-level factors that affect revisit rates to an academic, tertiary, pediatric emergency department and associated disparities. Data was sourced from the institutional data warehouse with removal of identifying information.

Contents include the associated qmd and html files. Raw data files are not included due to the sensitive nature of the data.
