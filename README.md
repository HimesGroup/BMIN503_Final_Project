# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains code and presentation for the "Identification and Classification of Retinal Bipolar Single Cells" project. The goal of this project was to take publicly available retinal single bipolar cell sequencing data and correctly identify the 11 known bipolar cell types using R, the R package Seurat, and known applicable cell markers. The following items are contained in this repository:


final_project_dana.Rmd        
> Containing the code used to load, clean, and analyze the data.

final_project_dana.html       
>Containing the final html file submitted to Canvas.

shekhar.markers               
>An R object containing the differential expression data for each cluster generated by the analysis.

Final_Presentation_Dana.pptx  
>Powerpoint presentation slides.


This repository does not contain the raw data expression matrix analyzed, as the file takes up 1 GB of space, but that data can be accessed at https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/retinal-bipolar-neuron-drop-seq and the original paper presenting this data by Shekhar et al. can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003425/.
