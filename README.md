This project investigates the characteristics of the patient population admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and details of their inpatient care using the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. It is being completed as part of the coursework requirements for BMIN 503 Data Science for Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania.

The report and data analysis for the project is contained within an R Markdown file (and corresponding HTML file) labeled within the repository as "BMIN503_Final_Project_SilviaCanelon".

The repository also includes a description of the variables and tables utilized from the MIMIC-III database under Excel file "Mimic_III_datadescription.xlsx".
