# nsong1/BMIN503_Final_Project

This is Nianfu Song's Repo for BMIN503/EPID600 Data Science for Biomedical Informatics Final Project

This project contains a R markdown file (.Rmd) and a HTML file produced by the markdown file. The .Rmd file can be run independently. Data are all retrieved by the code chunks of the .Rmd. it may take some time and please be patient to wait for the results.  The HTML file may be incomplete because it is too large upload to Github. This files represent the analysis of National Health Survey Data 2018 for the relationship between health and some measures of activities and life style of US adults. There are a total 11 sections. You are welcome to use any section of the code.

This project feathered with heatmaps that represent the significance of logistic and rare event logistic regressions. The rare event logistic regress is supposed to be better represent the correlation between covariates and the selected chronic diseases. 

Please be aware that the resulted correlation do not represent causality, they can be used to predict known diseases better than unknown ones. However, this correlation could be an clue about risk of diseases for any positive predictions. Please be cautious about the high sensitivity, because low precision is a company of the predictions. 

Thank you for your interest and please leave your comments.
