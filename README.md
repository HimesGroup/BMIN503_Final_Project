Ivor Asztalos <br>
December 6, 2022

This repository contains all the necessary files to calculate the diagnostic metrics for a diagnostic accuracy study of QTc measurment by four pediatric electrophysiologists. This repository contains: 

1. Qtc Measurements_raw data.csv - The raw data, a csv file containing the QTc measurement from 4 pediatric electrophysiologists and the final chart measurement on 200 pediatric ECGs. 
2. Final Project_IAsztalos.Rmd - an R markdown file of the code itself. This script handles importation, cleaning, and analysis. 
3. Final Project_IAsztalos.html - the knitted html output of the R markdown.
4. Equations for clustered diagnostic accuracy studies_gh.docx - a word document detailing some of the derivation of and the final equations for the diagnostic accuracy metrics and their variances as embedded equations. 
5. README.md - This readme file.
