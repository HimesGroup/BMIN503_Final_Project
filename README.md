# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Author: David Mai

**Overview**

This project seeks to analyze trends in worldwide vaccination coverage and incidence of those diseases on a per country basis. Specifically, I anticipate arriving at the conclusion that the increase in vaccination coverage is correlated with the decrease in incidence of those diseases around the world. In reality however, many less developed countries struggle to maintain low incidence of those diseases, even with increasing vaccination coverage. Several countries, both developed and developing, have also recently observed an increase in disease incidence - this descriptive analysis strives to highlight these recent trends and identify diseases and regions of concern. 

**Description of files**

The files included in this project are worldwide vaccination coverages per country for various infectious diseases, as well as the worldwide incidence of those diseases on a per country basis. These data are longitudinal over the mid to late 1900s to 2018 and were obtained by WHO/Unicef estimates. These are reported incidence and coverage and may be subject to misreporting or underreporting.

The main .rmd file hosts all the relevant code blocks to generate the analysis, graphs, and geospatial plots given in this project.

We also have national immunization survey (NIS) data, which reports demographics and household information about children who have or haven't gotten their vaccines. In the extension .rmd file, we seek to analyze what groups of people or types of households tend to get their children vaccinated according to the U.S. vaccine schedule.
