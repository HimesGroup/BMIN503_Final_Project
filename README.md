This is the repository for the final project in BMIN5030/EPID6000: Data Science for Biomedical Informatics.

## Overview of Project

This project utilized data from the 2021 National High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to produce tables, graphs, and regression models examining sexual health behaviors in female adolescents.

The goal of this project was to use data from the YRBS to see what proportion of sexually active adolescents that were assigned female at birth (AFAB) utilize pregnancy prevention methods, which pregnancy methods are most popular among them, and whether these outcomes vary by sexual minority status.
