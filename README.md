# EPID600 Final Project

The file file_project_Chen.Rmd is the markdown file that contains the code for analyzing blood cultures utilization data at HUP. I have not uploaded the raw data because I'm not sure if that can be shared. 

Using blood cultures data from FY2015, I have used descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to identify trends in the use of blood cultures. I am also analyzing the population of high utilizers to identify characteristics unique to that population. In addition, I am analyzing the relationship between pathogen identification and follow-up cultures to identify patterns in clinical practice.

Analyses to be done:
- Use category compression to cut down on the number of levels in my variables to improve visualization
- Make heat map of cultures taken for high utilizers over 30-day periods to better visualize trends
- Use violin plots to better visualize the shape of the data and identify split points
- Account for repeated measures and longitudinality in data by counting number of sets of blood cultures by the day rather than adding all of the sets.
- Make binary outcome variable and conduct logistic regression.
- Finalize set of graphs
