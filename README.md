# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains my final project about Castleman disease. Below you will find the project overview. 

Castleman disease is a rare disease characterized by lymph node enlargement, specific microscopic changes to the lymph nodes, and a broad range of symptoms and laboratory findings. Castleman disease patients can belong in one of two groups: unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) or multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). UCD is typically localized and easily treated via lymph node excision. However, MCD is a systemic condition associated with heterogeneous symptoms. MCD, being the more severe of the subtypes, is currently very poorly understood. It is thought that MCD patients have a 5-year overall survival rate between 50% and 65%. There is currently only one FDA-approved drug for the treatment of idiopathic MCD, the most aggressive type of MCD . Unfortunately, there has not been much of an effort historically to collaborate on Castleman disease research. However, more recently, the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN) has made strides in the research due to the implementation of a biobank and a medical record registry. In 2013 the CDCN initiated a medical record registry to promote the study of Castleman disease. This registry, called ACCELERATE (Advancing Castleman Care with an Electronic Longitudinal Registry, E-Repository, and Treatment/Effectiveness research) collects real-world demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcomes data on patients with Castleman disease. Currently, the registry has around 700 patients who have partially or fully completed the enrollment process.
