# Ian Campbell's BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains the final project for BMIN503.

This project focuses on understanding the causes of failed follow up of genetic testing after inpatient consultation. 

Clinical Genetics consultation during hospitalization attempts to identify an underlying cause of a patient’s multiple medical problems and may include genetic testing which takes many weeks or months to complete. Because the patient may be discharged from the hospital before the testing results become available, ensuring that the results are effectively communicated to the patient or family and their healthcare team is challenging. I used data extracted from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia electronic health record to identify factors which increase the risk of failed follow up. I used this information to inform implementation of a system including clinical decision support in an attempt to improve timely delivery of care.
