# BMIN503/EPID600 Gene Expression Predictors of Response to Chemoradiation Among Patients with Rectal Cancer

Project Purpose: Investigate whether there is a rectal cancer gene expression signature that can predict for response to chemoradiation. I used a publicly available dataset [GSE35452]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE35452 with Affymetrix array gene expression data as well as clinical data documenting whether the patient's tumor responded to chemoradiation or not. 

Output: Full HTML quality control and analysis report
