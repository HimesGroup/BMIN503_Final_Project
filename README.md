# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

My final project will be using the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey from 2018 to investigate the relationship between mental health outcomes and social predictors in adults living in Philadelphia. Another layer of this project will examine whether the strength of these relationships differs between geographical areas such as county.

The problem I am focusing on is how the quality and perception of belonging in oneâ€™s neighborhood can be reflected in the occurrence of a mental disorder diagnosis and whether mental health treatment is sought out.
