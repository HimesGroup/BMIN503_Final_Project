# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Emily Acton's Repo for the BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project is an assessment of utilization trends for antithrombotic drugs among adults with a history of cancer in the United States using data extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Specifically, this report contains variables loaded from the following NHANES modules: DEMO=Demographic Variables & Sample Weights, MCQ=Medical Conditions, RXQ_RX=Prescription Medications, and RXQASA = Preventive Aspirin Use.  These modules were loaded for the cycles from 2011-2018 (G=2011-2012, H=2013-2014, I=2015-2016, and J=2017-2018). Key analyses include exploration of the weighted trends (overall and stratified by age group) in preventative aspirin use and anticoagulant use among the general population compared to those with any history of cancer as well as a recent history of cancer; and, detailed examination of the weighted patterns of preventative aspirin and anticoagulant use among those with a history of cancer in the most recent NHANES Cycle 2017-2018. The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of real-world trends and patterns of self-reported antithrombotic drug use among adults 40 years of age or older with a history of cancer, an essential step towards planning future clinical trials and observational studies in ths area.
