# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project


## Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States

**Student: Long Khuong**


## Overview
Mobility restriction is one of the primary policies implemented to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its effectiveness remains a topic of debate. In this project, we aim to investigate the impact of mobility restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. The analysis considers various factors, such as government responses to COVID-19 and vaccination.

We found that, during the pre-vaccination period, mobility was positively associated with the spread of COVID-19, suggesting that mobility restrictions could potentially reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, in the post-vaccination period, this relationship reversed. The optimal lag effects of mobility were between 12 to 15 days during pre-vaccine period. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the effects of mobility restrictions during the pre-vaccine period were consistent, but not for the post-vaccine period.

Further research is necessary to explore the impact of mobility restrictions during the later period, requiring more comprehensive individual-level data, particularly on self-protection behaviors.
