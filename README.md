# BMIN503_Final_Project
Template repo for Data Science for Biomedical Informatics (BMIN503/EPID600) final project

Author: Chris Wirtalla

This is the README file for my final project The Association between Surgical Utilization and Presidential Elections at the County Level in 2012 & 2016. The primary objective is to use multivariable linear regression to determine the relationship (if any) between the rate of surgical discharges in the year prior to a Presidential election and Presidential election results (Republican voting share), while adjusting for prior election results, county-level socioeconomic, and economic measures of growth. My hypothesis is that, on average, counties with higher surgical utilization will show an association with higher Republican voting shares in the following year's election due to surgeons leaning more Republican and conservatism being linked with more aggressive decision-making. Surgery is considered the most aggressive treatment a patient can receive.

All instructions for downloading and storing the datasets used in this project are included in the RMD/HTML files. I also have a Zotero bibliography that I'm uploading here as biblio.json file that I hope can be used to generate the References section of the project, if stored locally.

Any critiques or suggestions welcome! :-)
