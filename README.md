# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Pulmonary hypertension is a chronic disease characterized by having a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of at least 25 mmHg at rest. It is progressive and leads to ride-sided heart failure and hemodynamic collapse. Patients with PH have high mortality and symptom burden, such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, syncope, and chest pain. Yet, there is limited research on how clinicians can improve care for this patient population. 

This final project is an exploratory study on whether random forest modeling is a robust approach in predicting 30-day readmissions and in-hospital mortality/ discharge to hospice among patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Both training data only and 10-fold cross validatation approaches were used. Researchers may use these findings to expand on building a prediction model and eventually an artifical intelligence tool to improve the care of patients with PH.  

The MIMIC-IV dataset was used for this study. Information on the dataset may be found here: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/
