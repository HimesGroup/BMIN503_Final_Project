# BMIN503/EPID600 Project: Structural Brain Imaging Biomarker for Traumatic Brain Injury
# by Elizabeth Mamourian

Thank you for reviewing my project;
In order to run the code, please download 4 data files:
1 "df_z.csv"
2 "df.z.icv"
3 "df.z_ctrl"
4 "df.z_ctrl.icv"

Set the variable `home` to the local directory where those data files are saved.

At the beginning of the Rmd chunk called `data_prep`, the variable called `fromBeginning` is set to FALSE. 
Now, it is possible to review the code for data preparation, and plot the results from the provided data files.
