# BMIN503_Final_Project
Template repo for Data Science for Biomedical Informatics (BMIN503/EPID600) final project

Author: Chris Wirtalla


This is the Readme file for my final project The Association between Surgical Utilization and Presidential Elections at the County Level in 2012 & 2016.  

All instructions for downloading and storing the datasets are included in the RMD/HTML files. I also have a Zotero bibilography but I'm not sure yet how to integrate it into Git yet.  

Any critiques or suggestions welcome. :-)
