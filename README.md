# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project: Using Childhood and Adulthood Stress Factors as Predictors for Nicotine Use

Katie Cardone

Nicotine use is a major health problem in the United States, as it is the leading cause of preventable death. Many family-related problems/stress have been associated with increased nicotine use individually, but this study considers whether the combination of these risk factors in a machine learning approach can better predict nicotine use. This study leverages data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2022 survey, as this provides data on both family risk factors and nicotine use. This study integrates childhood and adulthood stress factor predictors in a random forest model and evaluates the model's effectiveness in predicting nicotine use status with models with and without 10-fold cross validation. The model modestly predicts non-nicotine use status, as the area under the curve with 10-fold cross validation is 0.64. The most important predictors in the model are days of lived with an illicit substance user or prescription drug abuser in childhood, annual household income less than $25,000, bad mental health in the past month, lived with an incarcerated adult in childhood, sexual abuse as a child, sex, lived with an alcoholic or problem drug user in childhood, and whether basic needs were met as a child.
