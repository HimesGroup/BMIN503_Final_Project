# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository is for my final written report for BMIN503. Originally forked from [Final Project Repo](https://github.com/HimesGroup/BMIN503_Final_Project).

This is the analysis of a dataset done on a small pilot study that I was involved with a few years ago. It involved a telemedicine intervention on children that were obese or had asthma. Monthly for 6 months we had online sessions with the children and their families where we gave them counseling and had virtual doctor's visits. Each month we would send the child and their parent a copy of the PedsQL Survey via REDCap, and then for the initial and final visit, we did a much more in-depth evaluation, using multiple other surveys.

All data in this repo has been de-identified, there are no names present, and all dates have been shifted.
