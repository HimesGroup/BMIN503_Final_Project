### Files
The main file for running this analysis is **final_project_Cressman.Rmd.**

The accompanying files for this analysis are:
1. **Final_Project.Rproj** - R project file; must be saved in same folder as final_project_Cressman.Rmd in order to run. 
2. **all_counties_population.csv** - Contains 2019 population estimates for above counties.
3. **cdc_vacc_pa_nj_de.csv** - Contains county-level vaccination data from the CDC website. Already restricted to states of interest (PA, NJ, DE) due to size limits.
4. **cdc_cases_bucks.csv, cdc_cases_burlington.csv, etc.** - Each county has an individual case file downloaded from the CDC website.

**All other files are smaller chunks of code which make up final_project_Cressman.Rmd and can be ignored.**
