# Final_project

This repo contains my final project for BMIN503.

Overview of the project:
The overarching goal of this project is to explore potential mechanisms for an increased risk of gastric cancer among BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic germline variant (PV) carriers. Herein, we detail one route of exploration involving the use of BRCA1 and BRCA2 PV patient-derived gastric organoids (PDGOs).
Using PDGOs we look at differences in the number of organoids formed, growth, and morphology between PDGOs generated from BRCA1 and BRCA2 PV carriers as well as compared to PDGOs derived from patients without a known gene mutation.


This repo contains an .html and .qmd file of my final project. I had no prior coding experience before this class. Any and all comments or suggestions are welcome!
