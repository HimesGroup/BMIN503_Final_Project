# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project - Adherence to AAP Acute Otitis Media Guidelines
Author: Jonathan Beus

This project examines adherence to treatment guidelines for antibiotic duration for [acute otitis media](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Middle-Ear-Infections.aspx) (common ear infection) for patients seen and discharged from our emergency department. We explore factors associated with adherence to guideline-recommended antibiotic therapy duration. We additionally demonstrate improved adherence to the guidelines following implementation of new clinical decision support. Finally, we attempt to train machine learning models to predict which antibiotic a patient is likely to receive.

The included report is based on real data, but this project contains sample data as the original data cannot be shared due to the presence of patient identifiers. The sample data is based primarily on the distributions of variables observed within the data without respect to correlation between variables. This data allows the code to be tested, but should not be expected to give the same results as the real analysis.
