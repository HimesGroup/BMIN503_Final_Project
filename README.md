# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

## Project Overview
This project centers on the analysis of a pregnancy intention dataset, specifically focusing on a cohort of pre-COVID births at two affiliated hospitals—Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) and Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH)—both associated with the University of Pennsylvania (PENN). The primary focus of the study revolves around the investigation of whether individuals are asked the pregnancy desire question. The analysis intentionally avoids delving into the specifics of whether the pregnancy is desired or not. For the project's objectives, key variables of interest were extracted, particularly pertaining to patient demographics and patient-level characteristics.
