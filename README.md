**Summary**
This project is a retrospective secondary analysis of prospective cohort studies examining whole blood differential gene expression of septic shock patients within 24 hours of diagnosis compared to healthy controls. The objective is to perform a meta-analysis of publically available gene expression datasets in both pediatric and adult patient cohorts in order to identify which transcripts are differentially expressed both in common and unique to each population. Functional gene annotation enrichment analysis will then be performed utilizing the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) in order to identify which biologic and cellular processes are differentially regulated both in common and unique to each patient group. These results will help to characterize the transcriptomic response to septic shock in each patient population.
