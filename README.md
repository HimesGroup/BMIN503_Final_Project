This is the README file for my final project titled 'The Association Between Surgical Utilization Rates and Presidential Election Results in 2012 & 2016'. The primary objective is to use multivariable linear regression to determine the relationship (if any) between the rate of surgical discharges in the year prior to a Presidential election and Presidential election results (Republican voting share), while adjusting for prior election results, county-level socioeconomic, economic measures of growth, and surgeon workforce. My primary hypothesis is that, on average, counties with higher surgical utilization will show an association with higher Republican voting shares in the following year's election due to prior literatures that suggests surgeons lean more Republican and conservatism being linked with more aggressive decision-making. Surgery is considered the most aggressive treatment most patients can receive, so the objective of my project is to study whether the considerable variation in surgical decision-making seen across the United States may be associated with local political affiliations.

All instructions for downloading and storing the datasets used in this project are included in the RMD/HTML files. Data should be stored in the local directory of the user's choice (see the setwd() command included in the R code). A Zotero bibliography has been uploaded as a biblio.json file that I hope can be used to generate the References section of the project, if stored locally.
