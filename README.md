Social determinants of health, such as inadequate housing, lack of access to reliable transportation, and insufficient food access, have increasingly been recognized as being factors that adversely impact health outcomes (https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health). In this project, I attempted to determine if there was an observed association between low food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence in continental United States counties for the most recent year for which data about both were available, 2015. The project started with the hypothesis that there may be a positive association between decreased food access and type 2 diabetes prevalence. To be more specific, individuals in low food access areas may have little choice but to rely on convenience foods and fast foods for their nutritional intake, which may  increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. I used the AHRQ Social Determinants of Health dataset for this work.
