# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project is on the chILD Registry, a national multi-center registry for subjects with childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD).The intent of this project is to explore general demographics of subjects enrolled in the registry, and to conduct further analysis by diagnosis. A more in-depth analysis is performed on disorders with early presentations: neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), growth abnormalities, and surfactant dysfunction disorders, with a focus on diagnostics. The intent is to increase knowledge of important factors for diagnosis in theses cases, to help guide workup and management for children with suspected interstitial lung disease in the neonatal/infant period.

Special thanks is given to the Childrenâ€™s Interstitial and Diffuse Lung Disease Research Network (chILDRN) and Dr. Lisa Young for the opportunity to work on this project.
