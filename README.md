### Another comparison of two area-level socioeconomic deprivation indices: SVI (Social Vulnerability Index) and ADI (Area Deprivation Index) and their associations with asthma and smoking outcomes from survey data

#### Amy Goodwin Davies \| Fall 2023

This repo contains code and associated files for my final project for the "Data Science For Biomedical Informatics" (BMIN5030) course. The course director is Blanca Himes, PhD.

The goal of my final project is to compare the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and the University of Wisconsin-developed Area Deprivation Index (ADI) in their association with asthma and smoking outcomes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) CDC dataset.

The repo is organized as follows:
