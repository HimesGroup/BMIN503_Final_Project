# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This is the repository for the final project in BMIN5030/EPID6000: Data Science for Biomedical Informatics.

Overview of Project
This project utilized mammography risk factor data and MRI screening data from Penn Medicine (specifically Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania) to produce tables, graphs, and regression models examining differences in supplemental MRI screening utilization by race. 

The goal of this project was to use data from Penn Medicine 1) to see if the proportion of high risk Black and White women according to a new supplemental eligibility law is similar and 2) examine if eligibility and/or false negative rates are influenced by age and race/ethnicity. We determined that there were significant associations between race/ethnicity, false negative mammography rates and eligibility status.
