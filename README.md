### **Description**

This repository comprises the documentation and code for my final project in the BMIN503/EPID600 class. This project incorporates publicly available datasets for the following variables: 

  + **state-level mask mandates and COVID-19 mitigation policies** (Boston University)
  + **county-level COVID-19 cases and death** (NY Times)

Using these publicly available datasets, the project aims to examine the impact of statewide mandates on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in order to provide further support for or against a nationwide masking mandate for public face coverings. Specifically, the objective of this project is to explore whether statewide mandates played a role in curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States of America, as examined by a decrease in the exponential growth rate in COVID-19 incidence and mortality.
