# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project - Jacqueline Soegaard

Template repo for Data Science for Biomedical Informatics (BMIN503/EPID600) final project

Author: Jacqueline Soegaard

This is the README file for my final project "Thyroid Cancer - Penn Medicine Experience." 

Thyroid cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an estimated incidence of 52,890 cases per year in the United States [American Cancer Society: Cancer Statistics 2020]. It carries a favorable prognosis, with a disease-related 5-year survival of 98% overall and of 56% in patients with distant disease at the time of diagnosis. Thyroid cancer can be divided into several pathologic subtypes. The epithelial subtypes comprise three main categories: papillary (85% of cases), follicular (12%), and anaplastic or undifferentiated cancer (<3%). 

While it is a relatively rare tumor, at Penn Medicine we have a large amount of experience and tumor registry data for patients with this disease. Given our local experience, this project seeks to examine our dataset to understand summary statistics for our local population and their tumors and identify characteristics associated with tumor upstaging, tumor recurrence, and death. 

My repo contains two files of interes: 
- BMIN503_FinalProject_JSoegaard.rmd - code
- BMIN503_FinalProject_JSoegaard.rmd - HTML project report

Any critiques or suggestions welcome!
