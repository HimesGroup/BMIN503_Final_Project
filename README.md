# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project


## Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States

**Student: Long Khuong**


This repository contains files for my final project of BMIN503/EPID600 course, including the [.html file](https://khuongquynhlong.github.io/BMIN503_Final_Project/final_project_template.html) and the [.qmt file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khuongquynhlong/BMIN503_Final_Project/master/final_project_template.qmd) contains all the codes I used for the project.

Note: if you want to read the .html file directly without downloading, please click on this [.html file](https://khuongquynhlong.github.io/BMIN503_Final_Project/final_project_template.html). Since the data used in this project are heavy (2 Gb), I can not push them to this repo, but you can download them directly from the original links mentioned in the report.
