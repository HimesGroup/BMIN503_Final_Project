# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

My final project will be using the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey from 2018 to investigate the relationship between mental health outcomes and social predictors in adults living in Philadelphia County. 

Problem Addressed:
The problem I am focusing on is how the quality and perception of belonging in oneâ€™s neighborhood can be reflected in the occurrence of a mental disorder diagnosis and whether mental health treatment is sought out. There have been many publications showing increased odds of certain mental disorders in children living in neighborhoods with poor conditions (both physically and socially), but not much research has focused on this relationship in adults (Butler et al., 2012; Dahal et al., 2018; Kemp et al., 2016; Plybon & Kliewer, 2001; Reuben et al., 2020). A similar analysis was conducted in Philadelphia, investigating the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and serious mental illness diagnosis in adults (Byrne et al., 2013). However, my analysis will be using the entire Philadelphia population as a whole, whereas the Bynre et al. analysis only included adults already being treated for serious mental illness.

Dataset:
The dataset to be used is the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey from 2018. The 2018 survey was conducted during August 2018-January 2019, sampling 7,501 households in Southeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia County, Bucks County, Chester County, Delaware County, and Montgomery County). I will be focusing on only adult respondents. All of the variables used in this analysis are categorical. The mental health outcome variables are binary (yes/no), while social determinant and demographic variables have varying categorical values.

Research Areas:
This project will involve a few fields of knowledge to understand the problems, create appropriate analyses and visuals, and interpret the results and relationships. Firstly, this problem presents as an issue in the field of mental health; we can better understand what factors may predict poorer mental health outcomes. It is also a major issue for public health because the analysis will be at the population level. Revealing what neighborhoods are showing the greatest risks of neighborhood estrangement and associated mental health outcomes will educate public health entities in the Philadelphia area, and could even be a jumping-off point for geographically-targeted mental health interventions. Lastly, data science is an important field that will contribute to this project. The use of data tools to analyze, manipulate, and map these variables will be able to describe and visualize the relationships I aim to explore.
