# EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains a fake data set named "fake_data.csv" that can be imported into R to run the analysis. It also contains a Rmd file and an html file generated by running the RMD file. The Rmd file contains the full code for the data analysis and the html file displays the code as well as the results from running the code. The power point presentation is also pushed here.
