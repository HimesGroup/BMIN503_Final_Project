## Purpose

-   Merge NHC and VBC penetration data
-   Visualize and explore patterns across time
-   Linear modeling at the county level

## Imports

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```

## Load Data

```{r}
load(here("data", "interim", "county_vbc_penetration.Rda"))
load(here("data", "interim", "county_level_staffing.Rda"))
county_pene <- merged.subset
rm(merged.subset)
```

```{r}
county_staffing <- rename(
  county_staffing,
  Year = collection_yr
)

merged <- merge(
  county_pene,
  county_staffing,
  by=c("FIPS_Code", "Year"),
  all.x = TRUE
)
merged$VBCPenetration = merged$VBCPenetration * 100

merged$MAPenetration = merged$MAPenetration * 100
merged$ACOPenetration = merged$ACOPenetration * 100

merged$YearFactor = as.factor(merged$Year)
```

# Visualize across time

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(filter(merged, Year == 2017), mapping=aes(x = VBCPenetration, y = mean_cna_reported_hprd)) + geom_point() + xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,6) + ggtitle(label="Reported Nursing Aid Hours Per Resident Per Day By VBC Penetration (2017)")
plt
plt <- ggplot(filter(merged, Year == 2018), mapping=aes(x = VBCPenetration, y = mean_cna_reported_hprd)) + geom_point()  + xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,6) + ggtitle(label="Reported Nursing Aid Hours Per Resident Per Day By VBC Penetration (2018)")
plt
plt <- ggplot(filter(merged, Year == 2019), mapping=aes(x = VBCPenetration, y = mean_cna_reported_hprd)) + geom_point()  + xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,6) + ggtitle(label="Reported Nursing Aid Hours Per Resident Per Day By VBC Penetration (2019)")
plt
plt <- ggplot(filter(merged, Year == 2020), mapping=aes(x = VBCPenetration, y = mean_cna_reported_hprd)) + geom_point()  + xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,6)+ ggtitle(label="Reported Nursing Aid Hours Per Resident Per Day By VBC Penetration (2020)")
plt
plt <- ggplot(filter(merged, Year == 2021), mapping=aes(x = VBCPenetration, y = mean_cna_reported_hprd)) + geom_point() + xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,6) + ggtitle(label="Reported Nursing Aid Hours Per Resident Per Day By VBC Penetration (2021)")

How to explain the spike in VBC penetration in 2019? Something appears to be wrong with the data... Seeing rates \>1

https://www.naacos.com/press-release--medicare-aco-participation-flat-in-2022 Drop in ACO's in 2019. So why did VBC pene increase in this year? So why did VBC pene increase in this year? Is COVID impactful?

# Regression Models

### VBC Penetration by year

Negligible association, not clinically meaningful .002 \~= 7 seconds per resident per year In 2020-2021, increases to .005 \~= 17 seconds

Interesting that without adding state fixed effects, CNA casemix variable is not statistically significant.

```{r}
for (yr in 2017:2021) {
  filtered <- filter(merged, Year==yr)
  model <- lm(mean_cna_reported_hprd ~ VBCPenetration + mean_cna_cm_hprd, filtered)
  print(summary(model))
}
```

### VBC Penetration, Decomposed by Year

Still negligible. ACO pene loses stat signficance in 2019. This is the strange year where VBC penetration \> 1 in \~60 cases.

```{r}
for (yr in 2017:2021) {
  filtered <- filter(merged, Year==yr)
  model <- lm(mean_cna_reported_hprd ~ MAPenetration + ACOPenetration + mean_cna_cm_hprd, filtered)
  print(summary(model))
}
```

### VBC Decomposed with State / Year fixed effects

State / year fixed effects should prove influential for two reasons: - Regulatory environment varies by state and year. - COVID had a differential impact depending on statewide policies and cultural norms regarding vaccination.

\~10 second drop per pct point increase of MA penetration. ACO penetration is stat insignificant and tiny magnitude. Results are robust to incorporating case mix variable. In fact, the impact increases 3 seconds when adjusting for case-mix.

This is interesting. Reflects the differing levers in the MA program vs. the ACO program. MA payors contract directly with SNF's. A hospital based ACO's levers are indirect. May influence referral patterns, but only to the extent that they can influence hospital-based case managers. A physician based ACO probably has very limited influence in the SNF world.

```{r}
model <- lm(mean_cna_reported_hprd ~ MAPenetration + ACOPenetration + StateAbbrev.x:YearFactor + mean_cna_cm_hprd, merged)
print(summary(model))
```

### VBC Decomposed, total staffing

Total staffing initially dropping \~7 seconds with each point of MA penetration. Adjusting for case-mix makes magnitude even more negligible.

```{r}
model <- lm(mean_total_reported_hprd ~ MAPenetration + ACOPenetration + StateAbbrev.x:YearFactor + mean_total_cm_hprd, merged)
print(summary(model))
```

### Conclusions

Domain experts told me it was a nothing burger. My results support their claim that it's a nothing burger.

What counter-balancing forces may contribute to the outcome?

-   SNF's receiving pressure in Part A space, SNF admin responds by increasing services in Part B. AKA, the water balloon effect.
-   ACO's exert very little influence. Do not have many levers to pull in order to affect behavior. This outcome contradicts portrayals of SNF's as the "ACO piggybank".
-   Some SNF's may receive financial supports via integration in larger systems. For instance, a SNF onsite at a CCRC or Hospital may be subsidized against financial shocks.
-   MA contracting may be supportive in some respects. Depending on contract parameters, it may bring predictability that a FFS environment does not.
-   VBC penetration may actually increase concentration and adversely affect specific SNF's, but not decrease staffing levels on average.
