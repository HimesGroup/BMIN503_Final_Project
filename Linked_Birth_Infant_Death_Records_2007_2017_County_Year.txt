Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' appears instead of death, birth, and rate values when the death value represents 0-9 sub-national events. This"
"is because the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"2. 'Unreliable' appears for rates when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator. This is because the figure does not meet"
"the NCHS standard of reliability or precision. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Unreliable."
"3. 'Missing County' appears when county data is not available for a certain year. This occurs because the county did not meet"
"minimum population standards and thus the data for the county was recoded to the ""Unidentified Counties"" category for the"
"state of the county. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Missing."
"4. Infant deaths are weighted so numbers may not exactly add to totals due to rounding. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#WeightFactors-Totals."
"5. Note that there may be slight differences in the number of infant deaths when comparing the Linked Birth / Death Records to"
"the other vital statistics. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Weight Factors."
"6. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 250,000 persons or more. Data for all counties with fewer"
