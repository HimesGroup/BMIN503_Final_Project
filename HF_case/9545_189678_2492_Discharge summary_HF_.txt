Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right-sided thoracentesis [**5-20**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with a PMH of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation [**2199-4-14**], recent
STEMI and medical management [**2199-4-17**], and multiple UTIs, now
presents with CHF, fevers, and altered mental status. Ms.
[**Known lastname 4402**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-4-30**] after a 4d
hospitalization for altered mental status, felt to possibly be
due to UTI and/or pneumonia (treated with levaquin) and
benzodiazepine usage (ativan). Since discharge, she has been at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab. She had been on her baseline O2 requirement of 2L
by nc, but over the last week, was noted to have increased O2
need and crackles on exam. Attempts were made to diurese her
with 40mg IV lasix daily. A foley catheter was placed on [**2199-5-14**]
for better I/O monitoring. After 3 days (which was 3 days prior
to admission), she was noted to begin having mental status
changes. Her family described her as being \"wacky\" and she had a
fall (to her knees, no head trauma) on [**2199-5-17**]. On [**2199-5-18**], she
continued to be disoriented and confused. She also began to drop
her O2 sats again despite the diuresis, with O2 sats dropping to
the low 90s. Her oxygen requirement was increased to 3L by nc
with improvement in her sats. A UA was checked and was
suspicious for a UTI, so she was started on levofloxacin. On the
morning of [**2199-5-19**], she again became hypoxic with O2 sats in the
80s which improved to the high 90s on a NRB. She continued to be
delirious and confused, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation. In speaking to her RN at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, the
patient was noted to have lost 6 lbs in the last week (wt of 131
-> 125 lbs) with diuresis and there was a concern that she was
becoming dry. She was also noted to have elevated fingersticks
on [**2199-5-18**], with a FS of 470 (she is NOT a diabetic). With her
delirium, she was not sleeping and was noted to have NOT slept
in the last 48 hrs, which was unusual for her. She had been on a
1:1 sitter because she was attempting to get OOB on her own and
was pulling at lines (foley, IV). [**Name6 (MD) **] her RN, the patient had
been afebrile. She had NOT been on O2 prior to her MI, but has
been on 2L of O2 since the beginning of [**4-20**].
.
In the ED, her VS were noted to be T 102.4, HR 100s, BP 138/82,
RR 28, sats 100% on NRB, 89-91% on RA. She was given 500cc NS in
ER, then 40mg IV lasix (once her CXR returned). She had 250cc
UOP in the ER. FS was 91. CT head was performed and showed
resolution of her SDH. Given that her D-dimer was elevated, a
CTA was performed and was negative for PE, but did show a large
R sided pleural effusion and left atrial clot. She spiked a
fever, so was given PR tylenol and levaquin IV. Her troponin
also returned elevated at 0.20 and she was given a rectal dose
of aspirin. She was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring
of her respiratory and mental status.

.
IMAGING:
ECHO [**2199-4-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection
fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity
is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed (apical half of free wall). The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial vs. physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: inferoposterolateral myocardial infarct
.
TTE [**2199-5-20**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral hypokinesis/ akinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated and there is probable right ventricular
hypertrophy. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate mitral annular calcification with associated
mild mitral inflow gradient. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity
is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-18**],
findings are similar. LV ejection fraction may have been
underestimated in the prior study. There is evidence of severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in both studies.
.
NOTE: Transthorcic echocardiography cannot adequately assess
left atrial thrombus; this can be better assess by
transesophageal echocardiography if clinically indicated.
.
CXR [**2199-5-19**]: Low lung volumes. Since prior exam, there has been
interval increase in bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
The pulmonary vasculature congestion is seen. Stable appearance
of the right upper mediastinal mass, better seen on recent CT
and likely represents substernal goiter. Severe thoracolumbar
scoliosis is again seen and unchanged.
.
CTA [**2199-5-19**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. There does
appear to be a filling defect in the left atrial appendage, seen
on multiple views, likely representing thrombus. Alternative
explanation includes a CT reverberation artifact that can be
seen with patients in atrial fibrillation. Recommend correlation
with transesophageal echocardiography.
2. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis of the majority of the right lower lobe. Small left
pleural effusion with likely left basilar pneumonia or
aspiration.
3. Stable prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Evidence of right ventricular strain including persistence of
contrast and dilatation of the IVC and hepatic veins.
5. Stable superior mediastinal mass, previously characterized as
a goiter.
.
CT head [**2199-5-19**]: Limited study due to patient motion. Previously
identified left subdural hematoma is not currently appreciated
and there is no midline shift.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with history of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation, recent
STEMI medically managed, now with Staph aureus bacteremia and
left atrial clot, transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia
and unresponsiveness, then called out to the floor for further
management of her multiple medical problems as below.
.
# Hypoxia:  Admission CXR revealed effusions and pulmonary
edema.  Transudative effusion was tapped while in the MICU with
moderate improvement in her oxygen requirement.  Repeated CXRs
revealed stable b/l pleural effusions (R>L) with amount of
pulmonary edema varying with diuresis vs. fluid administration;
there were no infiltrates.  Once transferred to the floor, her
oxygen requirement increased so that she was requiring 10L
shovel mask in order to maintain O2 sats and did not improve
despite diuresis. The cause of her hypoxia is clearly
multifactorial as she has known diastolic CHF and with a. fib at
rate 90s-100s may have been affecting filling time and worsening
diastolic dysfunction.  Additionally, now has systolic dysfxn
with EF 45% post STEMI.  Her declining mental status also has
led to hypoventilation.  Decision was made with family not to
pursue intubation/MICU transfer if her respiratory status were
to further decompensate on the floor.  She was maintained on
shovel mask as above, while on the floor.
.
# Mental status changes:  Throughout her hospital course, her
mental status waxed and waned, and delirium was thought to be
multifactorial given her age, hospitalization, infection,
sedating medication (zyprexa), and hypercarbia.  While on the
floor, her mental status continued to decline so that she was
largely unresponsive.  Repeat CT head did not reveal rebleed in
the setting of anticoagulation.  ABG did reveal hypercapnea with
pCO2 in the 60-70 range, however family wishes were not to
intubate nor transfer to the ICU for noninvasive measures such
as bipap.  She remained somnolent and largely unarousable on the
floor.
.
# MRSA bacteremia:  Admission blood cultures showed [**2-17**] MRSA.
She was started on vancomycin and surveillance cultures have
shown no MRSA growth since [**5-25**] (at which time [**1-17**] were
positive).  The source of her bacteremia is not entirely clear
although she has a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] that was seen on CTA chest
(although not well visualized on TTE) and this may have been
seeded.  She does have a right shoulder effusion, but clinically
and on orthopedics evaluation, it does not appear to be a septic
joint.  imaging did reveal erosive changes of shoulder, but in
discussion with radiology, these findings are consistent with
degenerative disease in [**Age over 90 **] yo shoulder as opposed to infection
as cause of erosive changes.  Thus, right shoulder effusion was
not tapped.  Additionally, pleural effusion when tapped was
transudative and cultures were negative so as not to evoke this
as source of her bacteremia.  Furthermore, CT abd/pelvis/chest
did not reveal other sources of possible infection.  Midline and
right IJ pulled on [**2199-5-30**] and new PICC line was placed.  Given
the evolution of code status and family wishes to a focus on
comfort due to lack of substantial clinical improvement,
antibiotics were continued until discharge at which time they
were discontinued.
.
# Left atrial thrombus:  Seen on CTA chest, but poorly
visualized on TTE and TEE not performed.  Likely formed in the
setting of v. fib arrest and chronic atrial fibrillation as she
was not on anticoagulation most recently prior to this admission
given her recent SDH and subsequent burr hole evacuation.  As
above, in the setting of her bacteremia, there was concern that
the clot was likely seeded.  As above, subsequent surveillance
cultures have been negative while on vancomycin therapy.  She
was originally placed on heparin gtt and was then transitioned
to PO coumadin which, given her decline in mental status and
transition to focus on comfort was discontinued.
.
# Acute renal failure:  In the setting of diuresis and holding
of IVF administration to optimize her respiratory status, her
renal function worsened and she became oliguric most likely to
prerenal etiology as above.  Given her tenuous respiratory
status on shovel mask on the floor IVF were intermittently
administered while on the floor without significant improvement
in urine output nor renal function.
.
# CV:
a. CAD:  s/p STEMI and v. fib arrest in [**4-/2199**], medically
managed.  She was continued on ASA, BB, and statin while able to
take oral medications.  These were also discontinued with
decline in MS.
.
b. Pump:  EF 45% w/ inferolateral hypokinesis s/p STEMI as
above, diastolic dysfunction as well. She was admitted on ACEI,
but held in MICU [**2-15**] borderline blood pressures. As above,
imaging revealed bilateral pleural effusions (tapped x1
revealing transudate).  She was diuresed prn without improvement
in O2 requirements on the floor and additionally developed
increased bicarb in the setting of diuresis (contraction), but
also in the setting of worsening respiratory acidosis as above
(increasing pCO2).
.
c. Rhythm:  Atrial fibrillation with largely in the 90s-100s
occasionally requiring IV lopressor for rate control when unable
to take PO meds.  She was transitioned from heparin gtt to
coumadin as above.
.
# Anemia:  Hematocrit remained lower than previous BL 32-34 (MCV
elevated), but stable in the 27-30 range.  Although she was
anticoagulated, there was no clear source of bleed to account
for this new baseline.  CT head negative for rebleed [**5-30**].  Iron
studies reveal low iron at 17, TIBC 213, and ferritin of 171 and
appears to reflect iron deficiency anemia and element of ACD
given low TIBC.  B12 and folate were normal.
.
# Subdural hematoma:  No significant residual deficits post
bleed (previously with significant RUE weakness).  Neurosurgery
evaluated her on this admission and cleared her for the
reinitiation of anticoagulation as SDH had resolved.  Repeat CT
[**5-30**] while on anticoagulation showed no change from prior/no
acute bleed.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  No documented h/o DM, but consistently
elevated BS while here (100-150) likely in the setting of acute
illness/stress response.  HgbA1C was nml at 5.8% so as not to
suggest ongoing impaired glucose tolerance.  She was maintained
on insulin sliding which, but finger sticks and SS coverage were
discontinued to maintain patient's comfort.
.
# UTI:  Had enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin at OSH that was
treated prior to this admission.
.
# F/E/N:  PO as tolerated for comfort.
.
# Access:  Left PICC placed [**5-30**].
.
# Communication:  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4402**] (son, [**Name (NI) 382**] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12762**]
(home), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12763**] (cell), son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12764**].
.
