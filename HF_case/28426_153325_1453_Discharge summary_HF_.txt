History of Present Illness:
48 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 28, VL 65 [**2123-11-4**]; compliant
with HAART), CAD, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 30%)
who presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with respiratory failure and
NSTEMI. He presented to the office of his PCP [**12-17**] for a
three-week history of productive cough and was started on
levofloxacin 750 mg without improvement. He was admitted to
[**Hospital 8641**] Hospital [**2123-12-27**] with dyspnea and was intubated in the
ED. Partner states he was febrile to 102 the day of admission.
Chest x-ray with pulmonary edema but no significant
consolidation. He was started on vancomycin/zosyn and continued
on levofloxacin for broad coverage of pneumonia. Afebrile
without leukocytosis during admission.
.
BNP 1041. EKG showed lateral TWI. Cardiac enzymes: [**12-28**] 02:30
CK 348, MB 15.8, troponin I 2.77 -> [**12-28**] 08:00 CK 1514, MB
116.6, troponin I 39.19. He was started on heparin gtt and
integrillin gtt immediately prior to transfer in addition to
home aspirin 325 mg and plavix 75 mg. He was given lasix 40 mg

[**12-29**] CT abd:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations, concerning
for infection.
3. Compression changes in the thoracolumbar spine as detailed
above.
.
[**12-29**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and
regioanl akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, septum,
apex and the entire inferior wall. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**1-10**] Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with thinning and akinesis/aneurysm of the inferolateral wall
and akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall
and apex. (LVEF= 20-25 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: RV size and function appear normal. Severely reduced
LV systolic function with akinetic/aneurysmal inferolateral wall
and akinesis of the mid-LAD territory. There may be a thrombus
in the LV apex but this appearance may be due to near-field
artifact. IV echo contrast could not be used due to the
[**Hospital 228**] medical issues. A cardiac MR may help to clarify. At
least moderate mitral regurgitation, probably due to tethering
of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
.
[**1-15**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]:
The study is motion degraded. There is apparent fusion at C5-C6,
which is
likely post-surgical. No malalignment is noted. There is
increased signal
within the C6 vertebral body on both T1- and T2-weighted images,
which may
represent post-fusion sequela. There is no marrow edema on the
STIR images.
Axial images are markedly motion degraded.
At C4-C5, there appears to be a disc osteophyte complex with
mild central
stenosis and mild right and moderate left foraminal narrowing.
At C5-C6, there is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing, but no
significant
central stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is a disc osteophyte complex with mild central
stenosis and an indentation of the anterior thecal sac. There is
moderately severe left and moderate right foraminal narrowing.
At C7-T1, evaluation is limited.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes as described. Additionally,
there are
spondylotic changes at C4-C5 and C6-C7 as detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 1902**] transferred from
OSH with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.  Hospital
course by problem:
.
1. Respiratory distress/VAP/pulmonary embolism: Patient
transferred from outside hospital intubated due to respiratory
distress. Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
continue to be consistent with obstructive disease.  Patient
with trachobronchialmalacia on bronchoscopy. Patient treated
with solumedrol then prednisone [**1-1**] for COPD flare.  Patient
given presumptive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia
after developed infiltrate, increased secretions ?????? s/p BAL
[**1-2**], completed course vanc/cipro/zosyn.  Diuresed [**2034-1-2**]
given evidence of increased volume by CXR and secretions, but
did not improve oxygenation. PE seen on CT [**1-6**]; relatively
small but given patient's lack of pulmonary and cardiac reserve
this was treated with heparin, switched to Lovenox with bridge
to coumadin at time of discharge. He was extubated on [**1-11**] and
transferred to floor on [**1-12**].  He will have follow-up INR two
days post-discharge faxed to his primary physician's office.
.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: NSTEMI. Patient intially on heparin
and integrillin on presentation, but these were stopped on
recommendation of cardiology once his enzymes were trending
downward as they felt he had a completed infarct ?????? likely
mid-LAD stenosis. ECHO revealed new systolic dysfunction with EF
25%. As soon as able patient placed on aspirin, plavix, toprol,
lisinopril. Statin was discontinued as outpatient due to
interaction with HAART regimen. Cardiology recommended
outpatient stress test once patient recovered from this acute
illness. LV thrombus was noted and pt was anticoagulated on
heparin IV.
.
3. BRBPR: Had BRBPR in setting of initiating heparin and
integrillin gtt [**12-29**], transfused 2 units PRBCS. They were
initially held and then heparin IV was restarted once BRBPR
resolved. No further episodes and HCT was stable w/o need for
repeat transfusion.
.
4. HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have
virus with NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of
his HAART. We continued home HAART regimen; continued
fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis; and continued Bactrim and
[**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis.
.
5. Peripheral neuropathy and recent T8 compression fracture:
Neuropathy presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes in
OMR; on a very large home narcotic requirement.  Compression
fracture noted on outpatient chest x-ray ?????? chronic on imaging
here.  Initially, methadone IV was given to substitute for his
outpatient oxycontin. On [**1-12**] oxycontin and oxycodone prn were
restarted at significantly lower dose than patient was
documented to take outpt.  These were uptitrated rapidly as he
appeared to be withdrawing from home doses.  He tolerated up to
oxycontin 120 QID without adverse SE.
.
6. Hyperlipidemia: fibrate initially held, restarted [**1-12**].
.
7. Pyramidal symptoms: per patient's partner, hyperreflexia and
psychomotor agitation occurred after previous prolonged
intubation in [**2122**].  This was noted on [**1-15**].  Given concern for
hypersensitivity to SSRIs (per partner's account), fluoxetine
was discontinued and put as an allergy.  Given that patient has
hx of C5-C6 fusion and that he had bilateral pyramidal signs, an
MRI C-spine was ordered which showed an osteophyte complex with
mild central stenosis at C6-7.  Neurosurgery/spine service was
consulted and did not feel there was emergent need for
intervention.  His bilateral upper extremity tremor was felt
more likely to be due to SSRI hypersensitivity as he had had
this identical presentation previously after restarting
fluoxetine.  His fluoxetine has been stopped.  He will follow-up
in spine clinic with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in 6 weeks.
