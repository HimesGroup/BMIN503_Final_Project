Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VP shunt removal [**2203-11-20**]
VP shunt placement [**12-6**]
removal of Kwires R arm [**11-22**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3989**] is a 60y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, CAD s/p MI, AFib,
TIA, colon cancer s/p resection, s/p abdominal trauma with
splenectomy and left hand digit amputations, right forearm
fracture with plan for hardware removal [**11-22**], as well as
complicated hospital course last month for spontaneous SAH and
pneumonia now s/p trach/PEG/VP shunt who was sent from rehab to
an OSH for altered mental status and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
due to concern for VP shunt complication vs infection.

He was admitted to Neurosurgery [**Date range (1) 4216**] after presenting to an
OSH with the \"worst headache of his life\" and being found to
have a spontaneous SAH in the setting of Coumadin use (no trauma
and no known cerebral artery malformations).  He was intubated
in the ED, and was treated by an external ventricular drain.
His course was complicated by AFlutter requiring Dilt drip, VAP
(treated with Vanc/Cefepime, d/c'd to rehab on Vanc), brief
hypotension and pressors, and DVT (was restarted on Warfarin).
He underwent trach, PEG, and V-P shunt placement and was
discharged to rehab at [**Hospital1 700**].  His recent
baseline is that he is normally alert and responsive, able to
sit at edge of bed but not walking yet, and has no focal neuro
deficit.

Per transfer records, at rehab this morning at 1:30AM he was
confused, only A+O x1, slow to respond, and only verbalizing the
word \"yes.\"  Per report he had some new right-sided weakness.
Had temp 102.9 and was noted to have cloudy foul-smelling urine
in condom cath.  EMS was called and he received 800cc NS en
route to the OSH.

At the OSH, his VS were T 101.5, BP 167/118, HR 90, RR 16.  He
had WBC 13.3.  CXR with question of consolidation, and CT head
w/o contrast with no acute process.  Received Acetaminophen,
Ceftriaxone 1g IV, Azithromycin 250mg IV as well as Cefepime 2g
IV and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T 97.6, HR 75, BP 110/70, RR
18, POx 98% 3L TM.  Labs were notable for WBC 15.8 (74% PMNs, no
bands), UA with 0 epis, 35 WBC, few bacteria, moderate leuks,
>182 RBCs (foley had been placed).  CXR showed R>L bibasilar
opacities.  He was evaluated by Neurosurgery and underwent VP
shunt study which was normal.  VP shunt was tapped and CSF
revealed WBC 425 (87% polys), protein 57, glucose 63.  Gram
stain showed 4+ PMN, 4+ GPCs in pairs/clusters.  He received 1L
NS and Vancomycin 1g IV and was admitted to Medicine for further
management.  VS prior to transfer were 97.6, 67, 10, 170/83,
100%.

On arrival to the floor, patient was A&O x3, he denied fever,
chills, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, dysuria or
diarrhea. He reports headache with hip and knee pain that is
chronic. He wants to eat, but his daughter emphasize that he is
chronically NPO because he aspirated.

   WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    >15 colonies.

Imaging:
[**11-20**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of dependent bibasilar opacities,
which may
reflect an evolving aspiration pneumonia in the setting of
fever.

[**2203-11-21**] Wrist XR - In comparison with study of [**11-14**], there is
little overall change in the extensive fixation device about
previous fracture of the distal radius. Widening of the
scapholunate interval is not definitely appreciated on this
study.  Overlying cast greatly obscures bony detail.

[**2203-11-21**] CT head - Stable appearance of ventricular catheter and
ventricular size

[**11-22**] CXR - stable b/l lower base opacities suspicious for
pneumonia

[**2203-11-23**] CSF culture, source shunt. GRAM STAIN: no
polymorphonuclear leukocytes seen, no microorganism seen;
preliminary fluid culture is no growth.  WBC: 240(lymph 14%,
Mono 23%, Polys 63%, RBS 0), Tprot: 28, Glucose: 76.
[**12-1**] ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve,
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with mild to moderate global
hypokinesis. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-5**],
overall systolic function is slightly worse and hypokinesis
appears global. Severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Estimated pulmonary pressures are lower.

[**12-2**] Chest x-ray
FINDINGS:
  Right lung opacities have slightly worsened since previous
exam and are
slightly more confluent, suspicious for an infectious process or
aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Stable
cardiac contour is moderately enlarged.

CHEST 4:35 A.M., [**12-12**]
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-2**] through [**12-11**].

Right lower lobe consolidation and small accompanying pleural
effusion have improved since [**12-11**].  Mild-to-moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has improved since
[**12-2**], whether due to decreased
cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  Left lung grossly
clear.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard
placements and an upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and
out of view.  No pneumothorax.

[**2203-12-12**] 8:22 AM
PORTABLE HEAD CT

COMPARISON:  Prior head CTs without contrast from [**2203-12-10**], [**2203-12-6**] and dating back to [**2203-10-5**].

FINDINGS:  Study is limited due to the presence of artifact
produced by EEG electrodes and wires.  Again seen is a right
frontal approach ventricular shunt terminating in the right
lateral ventricle. There is persistent enlargement of the
visualized lateral ventricles which are significantly unchanged
when compared to prior examination.  There is opacification of
mastoid air cells, likely related to patient's supine position.
Many of the previously described findings are obscured due to
the artifact generated by the EEG electrodes, limiting an
adequate comparison.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2203-12-14**]):
      Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.

CXR [**12-13**]
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right
opacity is minimally more extensive than on the previous image.
Otherwise,
there is no relevant change.  Moderate cardiomegaly,
normal-appearing left
lung, the monitoring and support devices are constant.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3989**] is a 60y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, CAD s/p MI, AFib,
TIA, colon cancer s/p resection, s/p splenectomy, right forearm
fracture s/p ORIF with pins, and recent SAH and pneumonia now
s/p trach/PEG/VP shunt who presented with delirium that is
likely due to shunt infection. CSF cultures grew coag positive
staph aureus. Patient underwent VP shunt removal and received IV
antibiotics.

#. Altered mental status: Likely [**3-3**] infection (UTI vs PNA vs
shunt infxn).
He is currently back at his reported neurologic baseline but the
morning of presentation he had transient change in speech and
level of interactiveness.  He had fever and leukocytosis.
Post-splenectomy status puts him at risk of serious infection
with encapsulated organisms.  UA suggestive of UTI.  CXR also
suggests possible PNA.  More concerning is CSF with coag
positive staph. Patient underwent VP shunt removal and received
IV vancomycin and ceftazidime. Note that he does have hardware
in his arm but with no arm pain, not concerning for infection.
He is mentating fine, with good urine output and no elevation in
lactate so suspicion for shock is low but he certainly is
septic.

#. SAH in [**10/2203**] s/p trach, PEG, VP shunt.
His recent baseline is that he is normally alert and responsive,
able to sit at edge of bed but not walking yet, has some
left-sided weakness. He is continued on Tizanidine, Gabapentin.

#. h/o AFib: currently in AFib by exam.
Normally on Warfarin but has been off in anticipation of
returning to OR for Ortho surgery and has been bridged with
Dalteparin. Continued on metoprolol.

#. CAD s/p MI in the past: stable.
TTE with LVEF= 45-50% secondary to hypokinesis of the basal-mid
inferior wall, and inferior/anterior septum. He is on a statin
and BB.

#. HTN: BP currently elevated.
BP elevated but will permit in the setting of infection.
Lisinopril was recently uptitrated at rehab. Continue
Lisinopril, Metoprolol.

#. s/p MVA with Rt forearm fracture: s/p ORIF with hardware in
place.
Plans for removal of hardware soon but this will likely be put
off in the setting of infection. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is his Orthopedic
surgeon.

#. Neuropathy and chronic pain: stable. Continue Methadone,
Gabapentin and Dilaudid, Fluoxetine

#. h/o DM2 in the past: not on insulin currently.

[**11-19**] transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] for fevers, transient
neuro symptoms
[**11-20**] VP shunt removed, EVD placed, ICP 7 post-op with drain
clamped as of 1820oriented, moves all 4 to command readily
 [**11-21**]: EVD- open at 20,  exam he is awake, alert  pupils [**5-3**]
sluggish bilaterally, gave thumbs up on LUE, right arm casted
and moved fingers slightly to command, wiggles toes to command.
Started on sub q Heparin, as ICP was high, EVD unclamped, head
CT performed which showed
Ortho consult was done regarding his R arm fx : On schedule for
OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**11-22**] for removal fo Kwires

On [**11-23**], pt remained stable in the ICU and was transferred to
Step Down Unit.  ID was consulted and they recommended CSF
cultures, Legionella test, blood cultures and treatment with
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.  His vanco trough was 25.5 and thus
his dose was held.  Video swallow evaluated him and recommended
he be NPO for a repeat study.  On [**11-24**], patient's repeat trough
was 15.5 at target goal.  Video swallow was rescheduled for
[**11-25**].  Urine analysis and for legionellar was negative. CSF was
sent for analysis and culture. The CSF WBC was 75 and RBC 125.
ID recommended continuing the current antiobiotic regimen. His
neurologic status remained stable on [**11-26**].  On [**11-27**], CSF was
sent for analysis and culture: WBC 19; RBC 5. He remained
neurologically stable.
[**11-28**] the patient remained afebrile and  neurologicly stable.
[**11-29**] neurologic exam he became more lethargic and CT showed a
slight increase in ventricles size. EVD was set on 15, his trach
was decannulated.
[**11-30**]: his mental status improved , CSF study showed pr:15,
glu:74 and no organism in smear.

[**12-1**]: Patient diaphoretic and got an ECG.  Cardiology was
consulted at the request of Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding the evaluation
and management of altered mental status, diaphoresis, abnormal
ECG and positive cardiac troponin T. Cardiology recommended:
-start unfractionated heparin IV infusion without a bolus, with
a goal PTT 50-60 sec. Check PTT prior to infusion and adjust
percardiac sliding scale.
-Continue ASA 81mg daily after initial dose of 325mg tonight.
-Switch dosing schedule of metoprolol from 75mg [**Hospital1 **] to
50mg q8h (daily dose of 150mg). Adjust dose and intervals (q8h,
q6h) to achieve a target HR 55-65 bpm. Maintain SBP<140 mmHg if
OK from a neurosurgical perspective. Therapeutic options include
conversion of lisinopril to captopril with oral titration to
achieve goal BP vs. initiation of NTG IV
infusion with eventual transition to long-acting nitrates.
-Switch simvastatin to atorvastatin 80mg daily starting tonight
- Continue to cycle cardiac biomarkers (cTnT, CPK, MB q6h until
peak) as well as serial ECGs.
- Keep patient NPO in anticipation of possible cardiac
catheterization. Please check coags (PTT, INR in AM).
- Pt has a reported allergy to iodine. This needs to be further
clarified by the primary team, as contrast for cardiac
catheterization contains iodine and may cross-react. He has had
prior catheterizations and CT with contrast with no
documentation
of pre-treatment.
- He may require stenting which will mean at least 1 month of
ASA and
clopidogrel. He also has a recent DVT and chronic AF with a
CHADS2 score of 4 that requires, ideally, warfarin indefinitely.

[**12-6**]: Patient went to the OR for a VP shunt placement.  Aspirin
was held and 1 unit of platelets were given prior to the
procedure.

[**12-7**] : last night his o2 sat went down to 70s and after
suctioning came back to 99. CXR which did not show any
infiltration. Respiratory therapist got involved and found tube
feeding fluid in the lung. He remained afebrile.

[**12-8**]: exam stable. vomited x1 s/p pills. Med rec increasing
Metoprolol to 10mg IV Q4 hours until taking PO.

[**12-9**]:  HR 60-70 overnight. 2 doses of Lopressor held overnight.
Re-started tube feeds. Changed IV Lopressor to PO. Continued
Captopril 25mg TID. Vanc discontinued per ID recs.

[**12-10**]: Increased lethargy, hand tremors noted, desaturation,
thick sputum.  Sputum was sent for analysis. He also underwent a
CXR and non-contrast head CT. He became  diaphoretic-UA sent-
foley d/ced and replaced. Blood cultures and electrolytes were
sent.

[**12-11**]: EEG, CSF sent, desat overnight. He was intubated and tx
to ICU- likley PNA.

[**12-12**]: The Sputum culture showed staph aureus coag +

[**12-13**]: Mr. [**Known lastname 3989**] was extubated.  Tube feedings were re-started
and his neurologic status remained stable.

[**12-14**]: He remained neurologically stable. Hypertensive in PM.
Required Hydralazine and additional doses of Metoprolol.

[**12-15**]: Patient had some questionable seizure activity
charecterized by a hand tremor as visulized by his daughter. On
[**12-16**] we started the patient on Keppra and restarted the patient
on his Coumadin for his Atrial Fib.

Now DOD, patient is afebrile, vital signs stable and
neurologically stable.  He received his first dose of coumadin
(5mg) today for a goal of 2.0-3.0 for AFIb.  His incision is
clean, dry, intact without evidence of infection.  He is
tolerating tubefeeds.  He is currently non-ambulatory but is
working with PT/OT.  He is set for discharge to rehab in stable
condition and will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] accordingly.
