Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endotracheal intubation
2. Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
84 yo male history of prior stroke with right facial droop, COPD
on home O2, OSA on bipap, pulm HTN, HTN, MR, and CHF with EF 50%
who was sent in from the [**Hospital3 **] home after being
found at 9pm with unresponsiveness and pinpoint pupils. FS was
108. He was non-responsive to Narcan given by EMS.

In the ED, initial VS were: 96.8 176/80 48 100% on \"20L\". Upon
arrival to the ED, a right facial droop was noted and there was
not a lot of history from the facility or EMS so a Code Stroke
was called. Initially, he was able to open his eyes to sternal
rub, so he was intubated for unresponsiveness and airway
protection given concern for an evolving stroke. The ED noted a
difficult and inferior intubation. He received atropine 0.5mg
prior to intubation for bradycardia to the 30's. He was given
Fent/Versed after intubation.  No response to more Narcan in ED.
More information was then gathered. He had been at rehab for
coughing leading to syncopal episodes and rehab after prior
strokes. He was intermittently brady at the facility with BP
63/48. Patient on alfa-2 eye drops for glaucoma with constrict
pupils. Portable CXR after intubation noted that the ETT was low
and was subsequently pulled back [**2-8**] cms.  A RIJ was placed for
SBP of 80.  Repeat CXR was ordered.  He was given levofloxacin
for a UTI.  A CTA of the head and neck was done to rule out
stroke.  Neurology was consulted.  Neuro consult recs noted: CTA
attempted, contrast not perfused adequately. Transcranial
doppler (TCD) done on basilar artery showing flow to 110mm,
makes clot unlikely. Most recent vitals prior to transfer: afeb
47 103/61 500x14 50%x5.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated and sedated. His vital
signs were stable.  Of note, the patient's dry weight is
247-252lbs.  The patient called his wife this morning to say
\"goodbye\". He has been in the hospice section of nursing home
for end stage CHF.

Reports:
[**2179-2-21**] CXR: 1. ET tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina, and could
be withdrawn a few cm for optimal positioning. 2. Moderate
pulmonary edema. Right upper lobe paramediastinal consolidation,
which may represent acute infection or asymmetric edema.

[**2179-2-22**] CTA head and neck: CT head demonstrates no hemorrhage.
Mild changes of small vessel disease. CT angiography of the head
and neck was unsuccessful and no diagnostic CT angiographic
information is obtained. Exuberant calcifications are seen in
the aortic arch and the neck vessels. Pleural parenchymal
changes are seen in both lungs. - of note contrast extravasated
from the IV tubing.

[**2179-2-22**] CXR: Endotracheal tube has been repositioned, now
terminating about 5.2 cm above the carina. Heart remains
enlarged. Rapid improvement in pulmonary edema, which is nearly
resolved. More confluent opacity in right upper lobe is also
improving, but difficult to fully assess due to patient
rotation.  Calcified pleural plaques are present, indicative of
prior asbestos exposure.


Brief Hospital Course:
84yo M PMHx CVA, severe OSA, pHTN, and CHF w chronic 2L O2
requirement admitted with unresponsive episode, etiology
uncertain, family not wishing to pursue further workup, being
transferred back to nursing facility without a clear etiology to
the episode.

Active Issues:
# Syncope: Pt presented w unresponsive episode of unclear
etiology; given history of multiple UTIs, initially thought to
be toxic metabolic picture, however no clear source of infection
with all cultures negative.  Initially was intubated in setting
of episode, but was quickly extubated without residual acute
respiratory issues.  He was started empirically on vancomycin
and cefepime, which were stopped when cultures returned
negative.  Considered cardiac or neurologic cause; neurologic
thought to be unlikely given normal CT head; discussion was had
with family who agreed that no further workup was desired at
this time.  Patient was stable and discharged back to rehab.

Chronic issues:
# Diastolic CHF / pHTN/ OSA
Patient w severe OSA, severe R-sided CHF, pHTN, DLCO 50% ([**2166**]),
without signs of exacerbations on this admission.  Patient was
continued on home bipap.  Continued home torsemide, ASA,
