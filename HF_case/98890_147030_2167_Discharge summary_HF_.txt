Pertinent Results:
[**9-6**] Echo: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 30%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen with pressures 140 mm Hg systolic. MR jet
is central. Vena contracta goes from 5 mm at SBP 110 mm Hg to 7
mm at SBP 140 mm Hg. Reguritant volume by PISA 27 cc (HR 66, CO
4.5 L/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Regurgitant fractioni 40%) Post Bypass: The
patient is A -paced and an infusion of epinephrine.
Biventricular function is preserved. There is a mitral valve
ring in situ. It appears well seated and has mild residual
regurgitation (vena contracta 3mm). The mean gradient was [**12-20**]
mmHg across the mitral valve. The aorta is intact. The remainder
of the exam is unchanged.

Final Report
HISTORY: 61-year-old woman with status post mitral valve
replacement.
Followup right lower lobe opacity.

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest radiograph.

COMPARISON: Compared to chest radiograph from [**2118-9-11**].

FINDINGS: The right lower lobe opacity has improved with almost
complete
resolution. There is a small remaining right discoid atelectasis
at the right
lung base. The discoid atelectasis in the left mid lung has
improved in
appearance and is now just remaining small streak of
atelectasis. There is no
pleural effusion.

There are surgical changes from midline sternotomy with normal
alignment of
the sternal wire. The heart size is enlarged and unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in the right lower lobe
opacification, with
almost complete resolution. Small discoid atelectasis in the
right lung base.
Tiny atelectasis in the left mid lung. No pleural effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all pre-operative

directly to the operating room where she underwent a mitral
valve repair and coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery patient
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation and
awoke neurologically intact. On post-op day one she was started
on beta blockers and diuretics and transferred to the telemetry
floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were removed per protocol.  She continued to progress very
slowly with PT and was transfused 2UPRBC on POD 6 for a HCT of
22.  She was discharged to home in stable condition on POD#8.
Her creat. was 1.9 and will be rechecked on Fri. by the VNA.
