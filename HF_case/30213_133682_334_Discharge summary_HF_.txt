Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Planned Left internal carotid angio/stent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Catheterization with left internal carotid stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 yo male CAD s/p CABG, PVD, R Coronary artery
stenting, systolic CHF (EF 45%), CRF (creat 1.9), and HTN who is
now s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] stenting. In [**Month (only) 958**] and [**Name (NI) **] pt had episodes x1 of
LOC.  In [**Month (only) 958**], his wife walked into the room to find him
hunched over in his chair with + LOC and urinary incontinence.
She believed that he may have experienced some sort of prodrome
that caused him to sit down as the pt had been up out of the
seat prior to the episode.  It is unclear how long the episode
lasted but it was more than a few seconds as she called EMS.
During [**Month (only) **] the pt had another episode in which he was slumped
over in his chair + for LOC and urinary incontinence.  He
regained consciousnes in about 5 seconds.  The wife denies [**Name2 (NI) 3099**]
movements, bowel incontinence, and states that the patient was
not confused after the episode.
.
Review of systems + for exertional buttock and calf pain that
resolves with rest. + for SOB after walking 7-10 minutes.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema.

Echo [**2129-6-14**]:
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral wall and
hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel coronary disease. Mild diastolic dysfunction.
.
ECG [**2129-6-14**]:
Sinus bradycardia. First degree A-V delay. Prior inferior
myocardial
infarction. Lateral ST-T wave changes may be due to myocardial
ischemia
or left ventricular hypertrophy.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2129-6-13**]:
1. Severe 80% stenosis of left ICA.
2. Patent right ICA stent.
3. Successful PTA/stent of left ICA with bare metal stent.
.
Carotid series [**2129-6-1**]:
LEFT: B-mode images of the left carotid bifurcation show an
echolucent,
heterogeneous plaque at the origin of the internal carotid
artery. The common carotid artery waveforms are within normal
limits and have velocities of 58 cm/sec. The internal carotid
artery waveform has spectral broadening and velocities of
307/134 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 5.2. By velocity criteria,
this would correlate with an 80-99% stenosis. There has been
progression from the previous exam of [**2128-11-23**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 79 yo male with previous right Coronary artery
stenting who is s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] stenting at this admission.

[**Doctor First Name 3098**] stenting:
The patient had previous stenting to his [**Country **].  The patient had
a carotid series on [**2129-6-1**] showing a carotid artery waveform
with spectral broadening, velocities of 307/134 cm/sec, an
ICA/CCA ratio of 5.2, and 80-99% stenosis.  The patient received
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] stent.  He was monitored overnight in the ICU.  His
normal BP medications were held and his SBP was maintained
between 100-160 without the need for pressors. His neurological
function was monitored and remained normal.  He received ASA and
Plavix and was discharged on both medications.
.
# CAD/Ischemia:
The pt is s/p CABG in [**2113**], LIMA to LAD, SVG to rPDA and rPLV,
SVG to OM. He is s/p DES to SVG > OM2 in [**2124**].  While in the
hospital his ASA, plavix, and lipitor were continued.  His CKs
were normal.
.
# Pump:
The patient recieved an echo that showed left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel coronary disease, mild
diastolic dysfunction, and EF of 45-50%.  He was euvolemic while
in the hospital, had a normal pulmonary exam, and had normal
oxygen sat.  The patient was not on his home ACE or afterload
reducers because of the possibility of decreased BP secondary to
the vagal effects of stent placement.  He should restart these
medications after a BP check two days after discharge.
.
# Rhythm:
The patient should receive a halter monitor as an outpatient to
ensure that his previous two episodes of LOC were not secondary
to an abnormal rhythm.
.
# HTN:
The patient's normal home BP medications were held during the
hospitalization because of the possibility of decreased BP
secondary to the vagal effects of stent placement.  He should
restart these medications after a BP check two days after
discharge. The patient's normal home BP meds are Norvasc 5mg PO
daily, Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Toprol 100mg daily, and
Isosorbide Dinitrate 20mg TID
.
#CRI:
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency.  His baseline
creatinine is 1.9 and was 1.8 on this admission.
.
# Prophylaxis:
-The patient received Heparin 5000 units SQ TID during his
hospitalization

Medications on Admission:
Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily
Isosorbide Dinitrate 20 mg PO TID
Lipitor 40 mg PO daily 	
Lisinopril 5mg PO daily
