CT ABD and Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia. There
are also bilateral pleural effusions
2. There are bilateral hilar lymphadenopaties, which is
increased in size when compared to [**2113**]. Largest lymph node in
the right hilum measures 1.7 x 1.7 cm. At minimum this requires
follow up, since possibility of lymphoma or metastatic
malignancy cannot be excluded.
3. Multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphnodes.
4. Bilateral renal stones (right greater than left without
evidence of hydronephrosis). The stones on the right are
probably unchanged when compared to the prior study.
5. No intraabdominal abscess is identified.
6. Mild thickening of the colon is likely due to collapsed
colon, but possibility of mild colitis cannot be excluded.

Echo([**2116-7-28**]):
Ejection Fraction: 20% to 25%
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with some
preservation of basal posterior wall motion
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed


[**2116-8-1**]
CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2. Findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes and cerebral atrophy.

[**2116-8-3**]
LENIS
IMPRESSION: No acute deep vein thrombosis. Likely subacute or
chronic thrombus inhibiting wall to wall blood flow within the
right superficial femoral vein.

[**2116-8-3**]
VQ Scan
IMPRESSION: low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o male came into hospital because of need for dialysis.
Complained of substeranl chest pain and was sent to the
emergency room where he was placed in trendelenberg to have
central line placed. During procedure had severe dyspnea and
desaturation requiring intubation. Admitted to CCU service where
he was emergently dialysed for elevated potassium and volume
overload. While on dialysis he became hypotensive and shortly
developed a fever. He was found to have a right lower lobe
pneumonia for which he was started on antibiotic treatment. In
the CCU he was dialysed and volume status was watched closely as
he was known to have both systolic and diastolic cardiac
dysfunction. He was shortly extubated and after several sessions
of dialysis was stable for transfer to step down floor.
Throughout his stay he had periods of sinus tachycardia, of
which the cause was not discovered. He continued to have
tachycardia on the step down floor and so work up for PE was
undertaken. Evidence of chronic, non-occlussive clot in
superficial femoral vein was found on doppler of legs, but VQ
scan showed low probability of pulmonary embolus. His workup for
sinus tachycardia was negative and he eventually was discharged
with without tachycardia, on coumadin for prevention of PE, with
follow up of his INR, regularly scheduled diayisis, and follow
up with a cardiologist.
