Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Planned admission of aspirin desensitization.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lower extremity angiogram and stent of anterior tibial
artery

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M being admitted to CCU for aspirin desensitization prior
to RLE angiogram scheduled for [**5-9**]. He has been having
worsening RLE pain with ambulation that is partially relieved by
rest. A CT angiogram was performed showing significant arterial
disease. Given his PAD and CAD, it is important for him to be on
aspirin, but he has been resistant to this. He was reportedly
told by his physicians in [**Country 532**] to never again take aspirin,
and this is for unclear reasons. Given his need for
intervention, as well as worsening CAD and PAD, he is electively
admitted to the CCU for aspirin desensitization.
