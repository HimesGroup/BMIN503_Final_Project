Service:  CARDIAC

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old female with hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal
insufficiency, hypertension, and long history of atypical
chest pain, as well as possibly asymptomatic myocardial
infarction a long time ago.  Prior to admission, the last
cardiac evaluation was in [**Month (only) 956**], when a stress MIBI showed
an ejection fraction of 67% without evidence of ischemia,
although the patient only tolerated three minutes.

The patient was in the usual state of health until several
months ago, when she began to complain of increased shortness
of breath and pedal edema.  The symptoms specifically,
shortness of breath and chest pain, increased in intensity
about two weeks prior to admission.  On [**2181-9-3**], the
patient presented to her primary care physician and stress
tests were performed.  On the night, prior to admission, the
patient presented with left sided substernal chest pain
radiating to the scapula that had lasted for 10 to 12 hours.
The patient lasted all night prior to admission without
significant relief from sublingual nitroglycerin.  The
patient complained of nausea, shortness of breath.  The
patient was not diaphoretic.  EKG performed at the time
showed ST elevations in leads V1 through V3 and loss of R
wave.  The patient was given Morphine nitropaste and aspirin
according to protocol.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Gout.
4.  Arthritis.
5.  Multinodular goiter.
6.  History of appendectomy.
7.  Possible history of myocardial infarction in distant
past.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to AMIODARONE, WHICH
CAUSES FACIAL EDEMA.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
2.  Diltiazem CD 180 PO q.d.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg PO q.d.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d.
6.  Nitroglycerin patch 10 mg PO q.d.
7.  Vasotec 75 mg PO b.i.d.
8.  Allopurinol 100 mg q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Vital signs afebrile.  Heart rate:  \"geminy.\"  Blood
pressure:  110/60.  Respiratory rate:  16.  100% on room air.
 The patient appeared to be mild distress.  HEENT:  JVP
distention of about 10 cm.  No carotid bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, S3 sound, no
murmurs.  PULMONARY:  Examination showed diffuse crackles
anteriorly and laterally without wheezes.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities showed
trace edema.  Right dorsalis pedis pulse palpable.  Left
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were Dopplerable.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was alert and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves:  Grossly intact with full range of
motion of lower and upper extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
Hematocrit 32.4, white blood cell count 10.7, platelet count
260, sodium 143, potassium 5.0, BUN 33, creatinine 1.1.
Creatinine kinase 350, MB 55, troponin 24.1.  Chest x-ray
performed on [**2181-9-5**] showed enlarged cardiac silhouette,
diffuse interstitial opacifications and small bilateral
pleural effusions.  EKG showed sinus rhythm.  There was also
left atrial abnormality, slow R wave progression consistent
with underlying anterior myocardial infarction, nondiagnostic
Q waves seen in lead #3.  Anterolateral ST and T wave changes
consistent with ischemia.  There was also loss of R wave
progression in leads V1 through V3 with ST segment
elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the coronary
care unit.  The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction
by enzymes and EKG changes.  Cardiac catheterization
procedure was performed on [**2181-9-5**], showed three-vessel
coronary artery disease.  It also showed severe systolic left
ventricular dysfunction, severe biventricular diastolic
dysfunction.  There was also severe pulmonary hypertension.
IABP device was inserted.

On [**2181-9-6**] the patient was taken back to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory.  Successful stenting of the
proximal LAD was performed.  At the same time limited
angiography of the right dominant system showed a severely
diseased ALD with a 90% ulcerated lesion and a long segment
of 80% to 90% disease in the mid-distal LAD.  Cardiac
catheterization also revealed 50% diffuse disease in the mid
segment and 90% disease in the distal segment of the LAD.
Left circumflex artery had up to 90% disease.  RI had 50%
lesion.  RCA was diffusely diseased up to 80% in the proximal
segment and subtotally occluded approximately 99% in the mid
vessel.

The patient was started on IV heparin, nitroglycerin drip,
Lasix p.r.n., Protonix, Lipitor, and Lopressor, as well as
aspirin.

On [**2181-9-7**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times three with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending coronary artery, reverse saphenous
vein graft from the aorta to the right posterior descending
coronary artery and reverse saphenous vein graft from the
aorta to the obtuse marginal coronary artery.  The procedure
was without complications.  Please see the full operative
report for further details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
satisfactory condition.

Postoperative course was complicated by upper GI bleed.
Hematocrit at the time was 27 with platelet count of 125,000.
The patient was treated with FFP and packed red blood cells.
At that time urgent EGD was performed.  Upper GI studies
showed a deep ulcer in the GE junction, which was thought to
be the cause of the bleeding.  Epinephrine injection was
performed to stop the bleeding of the ulcer.

The patient continued to well in the Intensive Care Unit.
Diet was advanced.  She was in sinus rhythm with blood
pressures maintained without pressors on postoperative day
#3.  The patient was successfully extubated.

On [**2181-9-12**] the patient was transferred to the regular
cardiac floor for further care.  She was showing adequate
oxygenation at 96% on two liter nasal cannula.  She was noted
to be unwilling to get out of bed.  Regarding physical
therapy:  The patient's Foley catheter was discontinued on
[**2181-9-12**].  Maximum temperature was 100.0.  She had intensive
treatment program with physical therapy.

On examination, the patient continued to have significant
upper extremity swelling bilaterally.  The swelling slowly
subsided, although on the day of discharge she was still
edematous.  The patient was maintained on Lopressor and Lasix
throughout the hospitalization.  On [**2181-9-14**], the patient
was discharged to the rehabilitation center in stable
condition.
