Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation in class will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name and text below with your own, but leave the headers.

### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

I will analyze the NHANES data from 1999-2000 for 7386 participants in a study of the tuberculin skin test (TST) for Latent TB Infection (LTBI). The goal is to understand better the implications of the size (i.e., the width, measured in millimeters) of the reaction in individuals who are reactive and whether the traditional cut-off for positivity of 10 mm makes sense from a medical perspective.


### Introduction 
In the first paragraph, describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

In the second paragraph, explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains an immense health problem worldwide. Approximately one third of the world's population is, or has been, infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and new infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. Mycobacteria can survive for decades in latent form; approximately one in ten latent infections eventually reactivates, and active disease, if left untreated, is more than 50% fatal. High-prevalence countries typically vaccinate their inhabitants with Bacille de Calmette et Gu√©rin (BCG), which is, on average, approximately 50% effective in preventing tuberculosis. The tuberculin skin test (TST) has been around for more than 100 years and comprises a mixture of about 200 non-specific antigens that are shared with non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM), including the strains developed from Mycobacterium bovis for the BCG vaccine; thus, approximately 40% of individuals uninfected with MTB, but vaccinated with BCG, test positive by the TST. The motivation for this study comes from the clinical dilemmas faced by the Occupational Medicine Service of the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS). All new hires for UPHS are screened for TB infection using the TST, including those who were born outside the U.S. (where both MTB and BCG vaccination are more common). If the test is positive, a chest x-ray is obligatory to rule out active TB infection and thereby avoid exposure to UPHS patients. However, most MTB infections are latent (LTBI), and treatment of LTBI is not without risks. Which individuals with a positive TST should be treated for LTBI? Should the same standard cut-off for positivity of 10 mm be used for those with a low vs. high prior probability of LTBI, BCG, and NTM? 

To address the above questions, I will analyze the NHANES data from 1999-2000 for 7386 participants in a study of the TST for LTBI, starting with mixture models to assess the contributions of NTM and BCG to lower levels of reactivity. I will then use data on the prior probabilities of LTBI in different populations to generate positive predictive values for different sizes of TST reactivity. The problem is interdisciplinary as it draws on the mathematics and statistics of mixture models (with the help of Larry Singh, who did is his PhD on mixture models), Bayesian modeling (with the help of Shane Jensen, who is an expert on Bayesian data analytics), and the occupational medicine of TB testing (with the help of Amy Behrman, who is the Director of Occupational Medicine for UPHS). I've already discussed with Dr. Singh different approaches to mixture-modeling the TST data, and with Dr. Jensen the different ways to incorporate priors into the model. Most of the preceding paragraph on TB, and the dilemmas faced by Occupational Medicine in interpreting, and acting on, TST results, was derived from my conversations with Dr. Behrman. 

### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
