### Overview
My project is to explore the performance of predicting ventilator pressure using machine learning. The data I am using are shared through a Kaggle competition that hosted by Google brain and Prinston University (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ventilator-pressure-prediction/overview).

The three faculty/staff advisors for my projects are: Tsui Rich, Ruiz Victor, Russel Richie. During our discussion, they gave me suggestions on model selection, recurrent model techniques, and time-seires feature engineering.

### Introduction 
Clinicians use mechanical ventilator to help patients who have trouble breathing.But it is a labor intensive treatment. Especially in the early stage of COVID-pandemic, this caused a lot loss due to a shortage of clinicians. Develop automatic ventilator could relieve the burden but that requires precise pressure control and adaption to different lung attributes. I will explore using Deep Learning and time-seines data analysis to predict inspiration pressure of each breath. This is cross-disciplinarian problem as it requires knowledge in mechanics, machine learning, time-series modeling, and deep learning. In the meeting the faculty, we brain-stormed that recurrent neural network may potentially catch the time-series subtle changes during breath.


### Methods
Data:
The data are time-series records that catches the pressure censor readings during each breath (the output to be predicted).The input features (data used to predict) are two control inputs and two lung-specific features. The two cnotrol inputs are (1) inspiratoory valve (0-100), indicating the percentage of valve that let air in, and (2) the expiratoory valve (0 or 1), indicating whether the exploratooory valve is open. The lung-specific attribute features are R-indicating how restricted the airway is, and C-indicating how compiant the lung is.  

Modeling strategies:
LSTM
LSTM+CNN
LSTM+Manual feature engineering
LSTM+CNN+Manual feature engineering

### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
