Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, but this is not required.

### Overview
Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

For this project, we are seeking to improve the time to diagnosis to heart failure diagnosis by leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data. Specifically, we aim to use various methods to pull the various diagnostic components from EHR, then analyze and process them to assist with heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) diagnosis. For this class specifically, we are looking to leverage  the unstructured text from medical notes using NLP to assist in HF diagnosis. We will determine the diagnostic ability of unstructured text notes in determing HF and then compare it to other known diagnostic and predictive factors. 

### Introduction 
Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem. Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Heart failure (HF) is a progressive clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood. It carries a poor prognosis with 50% mortality within the first 5 years of diagnosis, and is associated with significant co-morbidity and remarkable decrease in quality of life and functional status. Unfortunately, recent data suggest HF-associated mortality and morbidity are on the rise. 

While the reason for the HF-related poor outcomes is multifactorial, an early and time-sensitive diagnosis has been shown to paly a significant role. In fact, research showed that a time-sensitive diagnosis of HF may reduce patientsâ€™ mortality and morbidity. As such, wide research efforts are being deployed to develop processes including algorithms to support clinicians (particularly non-cardiologist) in early diagnosing HF. 


### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

For this project, we are using MIMIC-III which is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. This is a vast dataset with many variables. We just got accessed to the dataset yesterday (11/16/2022) and are planning to pull the data, query it and start analyzing. 

To retrieve the data, we are using Google Big Query to pull the data onto our local environment. As part of retrieving that data via Google Big Query, we will need to make use of SQL. Subsequently, we will load the retrieved data on our Rstudio (or Python) to query and clean the data. Demographics and results are shown below. 

Next we will take the following steps;
  1. We will apply HFrEF phenotype to defined case and control populations (~100 each) for heart failure with reduce ejection fraction (HFrEF) using existing definitions from https://phekb.org/. We have edited the definition of our case to be more specific for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such definitions will be provided in the supplementary materials. 
  2. Query notes associated with HFrEF encoded encounters
  3. Apply open-source NLP tools to encode variables for your study 
  4. Develop and apply logic to features that are indicative to HFrEF definition from notes to predict case label
  5. Evaluate how well the predictive power of rule logic for phenotyping HFrEF (extrinsic evaluation) and areas for improvement based on errors in NLP and rules (intrinsic evaluation)


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
