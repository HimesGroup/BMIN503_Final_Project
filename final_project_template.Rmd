Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation in class will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name and text below with your own, but leave the headers.

### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.


The goal of this project is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of lung transplantation in the United States using publicly available data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We will also investigate how the coefficients of the lung allocation score (LAS; a prediction model used to prioritize patients for lung transplant) have changed over time. Finally, we will assess how well the current LAS model predicts post-transplant survival, and compare its performance to that of a logistic regression model which allows the coefficients of important predictors to vary with time.


### Introduction 
In the first paragraph, describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

In the second paragraph, explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

In May 2005, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) modified their lung transplantation policy from one in which potential recipients were prioritized based on the amount of time spent on the waiting list to one in which donor lungs were allocated to recipients based on a lung allocation score (LAS). The LAS essentially compares patients' transplant benefit to their waiting list urgency, assigning individuals with higher values greater priority for transplant. Since the adoption of the LAS, studies have shown that the mortality rate for patients on the lung transplant waiting list has decreased. However, resource use and geographic and gender disparities in lung allocation have increased. Additionally, while the statistical models used to construct the LAS control for patientsâ€™ demographics, diagnoses, and laboratory values, the model itself is static in nature. That is, a derivation cohort is assembled, model coefficients are estimated based on this cohort, and then those coefficients are applied to individuals outside the cohort. To date, the LAS coefficients have been updated using three different cohorts at three different times: 2005, 2010, and 2015. Yet no one has investigated how LAS coefficients change over time, or whether such changes impact the predictive accuracy of the LAS. In this project, we aim to explore the prevalence and risk factors of lung transplantation in the United States using publicly available (after submitting a [data request](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/)) data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) collected between 2007 and 2015. We will also investigate how the coefficients of the lung allocation score (LAS; a prediction model used to prioritize patients for lung transplant) have changed over time. Finally, we will assess how well the current LAS model predicts post-transplant survival, and compare its performance to that of a logistic regression model which allows the coefficients of important predictors to vary with time.

This problem is relevant to many different stakeholders, including epidemiologists, statisticians, clinicians, and sociologists. Epidemiologists are interested in characterizing how both the pre- and post-transplant mortality rate of individuals with chronic lung diseases changes over time, as well as identifying whether certain risk factors are associated with mortality. Statisticians are interested in developing tools that allow prediction models (such as the LAS) to be updated more easily and frequently, as "dynamic" modeling strategies might improve the performance of prediction models in real-world settings. Clinicians are interested in predicting pre- and post-transplant survival accurately so that donor lungs are allocated to the appropriate patients in the appropriate order. Finally, sociologists are interested in understanding the role such prediction models play in clinical decision making. 

Given the interdisciplinary nature of this project, I sought advice from representatives from each of these fields: Dr. Stephen Kimmel, MD, MSCE, a cardiovascular epidemiologist with experience in the development and validation of clinical prediction models; Dr. Alisa Stephens-Shields, PhD, a biostatistician with expertise in observational studies, longitudinal data, and causal inference methods; Dr. Julia Szymczak, PhD, a medical sociologist with expertise in using qualitative methods to understand medical culture and practice; and Dr. Edward Cantu, MD, MSCE, a lung transplant surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Together, these individuals have suggested that I: 1) compare the observed mortality outcomes for patients who received lung transplants to the mortality outcomes that were predicted by the existing lung allocation score (LAS) algorithm; 2) compare the observed mortality outcomes to those predicted by a logistic regression model which allows for coefficients to change over time; 3) think beyond traditional measures of predictive accuracy, such as calibration and discrimination, to consider the target parameter that the LAS algorithm purports to estimate versus the target parameter that the LAS algorithm actually estimates; 4) think about how the current LAS model is used in clinical practice, and whether modifications to this model would influence how it is used; and 5) consider looking into disparities in transplantation among different patient populations (e.g., patients with different ages, race/ethnicity, or diagnoses). 


### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
