### Overview
Castleman disease is a rare inflammatory disorder. The most-deadly subtype (idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD)) has a 35% mortality rate. Siltuximab is the only FDA-approved drug to treat iMCD, and nearly 60% of patients do not respond to siltuximab. Using data obtained from the siltuximab trial and from the first-ever Castleman disease natural history registry, ACCLERATE, this project aims to identify the characteristics of siltuximab responders vs. non-responders.  First, the siltuximab-trial data will be used to develop a decision tree to identify responders vs. non-responders.  The decision tree algorithm will then be validated by data collected in the ACCELERATE registry. Bill LaCava advised on the development of decision tree algorithm - specifically he provided advice on restricting to certain data collection points.  In addition, regression models will be run on the ACCELERATE data in order to test the association between several predictors and the response outcome.  Rebecca Hubbard advised on the development of regression models. Specifically, we discussed the non-standard time-points and data collection and how to develop a mixed-effects model. Using heatmaps, clinical, laboratory, and pathological features of Castleman disease patients will be graphically presented. Jason Moore advised on developing heatmaps looking at characteristics on one axis, patients on the other axis, and using hierarchical clustering to try and identify subgroups. 

### Introduction 
Castleman disease consists of a group of three heterogeneous diseases, characterized by common lymph node features.  The three subtypes include unicentric Castleman disease (UCD), HHV8-associated multicentric (HHV8+MCD), and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). UCD is often curative (95%) by lymph node excision. Caused by the HHV8 virus, HHV8+MCD is well controlled with rituximab and anti-viral medications.  However, iMCD represents the most deadly subtype, with 35% 5-year mortality rate.  Though there is one FDA-approved drug for iMCD (siltuximab), only ~30-40% patients respond positively. In order to appropriately treat patients, it is crucial to understand why a subset of patients responds to siltuximab while others do not. 

Understanding the patient population and characteristics of treatment responders vs. non-responders requires a multidisciplinary approach.  Proteomics can be used to characterize the protein state of patients in flare compared to remission and to understand if there are proteomic changes specific to any certain subgroup.  It is also crucial to understand the patient's clinical presentation and to associate clinical phenotype with proteomic phenotype.  Understanding this patient population and disease requires a translational and multidisciplinary approach. While our research group is performing studies to understand the proteomic state of these patients, we currently have available a rich set of clinical data from the siltuximab trial and are actively collecting data in the first ever patient registry.  Using these two datasets, a decision tree identifying responders and non-responders can be developed and validated. Further, additional predictors collected in the ACCLERATE registry can be modeled in a mixed effects model to determine their effect on treatment response.  In addition, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this patient population can be summarized using visualization techniques. 

### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
