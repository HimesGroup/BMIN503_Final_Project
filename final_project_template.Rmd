### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

> Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a cornerstone of clinical bone health assessment. The preferred skeletal regions of interest for pediatric patients are the total body and lumbar spine. However, due to a variety of reasons, these two measurements are at times unattainable. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop valid and informative measures of bone density at alternative skeletal regions of interest. The ultradistal radius (i.e., the wrist) is one skeletal site with considerable potential, but this particular measure has yet to be thoroughly characterized in children with respect race and sex differences, changes during growth, tracking throughout childhood and adolescence, the confounding of stature, and it's ability to predict fracture. The goal of this project is to characterize ultradistal radius bone mineral density during childhood with respect to race, sex, age, stature, bone geometry, and fracture history. We will accomplish this study by performing a secondary analysis of the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study which includes >2,000 black and non-black males and females ages 5-19 at baseline with over 10,000 measurements collected over a six-year period. Dr. Zemel and Dr. Kalkwarf's background on childhood growth and Dr. McCormack's background in R programming were excellent sources of knowledge for the development of this project, which can be located at the following link: --------. 

### Introduction 
> The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) has been instrumental in characterizing bone growth during childhood and identifying the factors that contribute to these complex processes. Several traditional and non-traditional bone phenotypes have been explored using BMDCS data, with the exception of bone mineral density (BMD) at the ultradistal radius (i.e., the forearm). Understanding the factors associated with ultradistal radius BMD during childhood, such as age, sex, race, and bone geometry, will be criticial in developing this specific phenotype for clinical application, as well as understanding fracture etiology during growth since the forearm is the most common fracture site in youth.

> Both modifiable and non-modifiable factors are involved in achieving optimal bone health during childhood. The attainment of "peak bone mass" during growth has significant ramifications on the risk for fracture and osteoporosis in adulthood. Bone-augmenting modifiable factors include physical activity, diet, and medications, while non-modifiable factors include genetics, population ancestry, sex, age, and sexual maturation. I am a nutritionist and bone biologist by training and my post-doc mentor, Dr. Babette Zemel, is a biological anthropologist with vast knowledge of human growth. Dr. Zemel was the principal investigator on the BMDCS, which was a prospective multi-site study of greater than 2,000 children funded by the NIH, and has identified maturational, dietary, and genetic determinants of bone health in this cohort. Dr. Kalkwarf is also a nutritionist and bone biologist, and has extensive expertise in childhood growth. Finally, Dr. McCormack is an endocrinologist and is an expert in childhood growth and R programming. Collectively, this collaborative team has aided in developing the study aims, conducting longitudinal statistical analyses in R, and developing a plan of action to further develop this new phenotype (i.e., ultradistal radius BMD) in future studies with respect to understanding the genetic and behavioral factors involved in forearm bone density accrual. Current pediatric recommendations for clincal bone health assessment suggest either the total body or lumbar spine as the two most appropriate skeletal regions for osteoporosis diagnosis. However, developing the ultradistal radius BMD phenotype  will help efforts toward establishing this outcome as an ancillary measure of bone health in instances that a total body or lumbar spine bone density scan is not feasible or appropriate at these skeletal regions of interest. 

### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

>We used data from the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) to complete this study. The BMDCS was a large, multi-center, multi-ethnic study including 2014 healthy black and non-black children and adolescents that completed approximately 10,000 laboratory visits over a six year period. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was assessed at the ultradistal (UD) radius using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), fracture history was assessed via self-report, and bone geometry was assessed at the distal radius using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Longitudinal mixed regression was used to assess changes in UD radius aBMD during childhood, as well as sex- and race-related differences in these changes. Additionally, relationships between UD radius aBMD and fracture history and bone geometry were assessed using longitudinal mixed regression.


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
