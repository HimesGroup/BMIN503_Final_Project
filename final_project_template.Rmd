### Overview 
For this project, we are seeking to determine the feasibility of rule logic language processing tool to extract the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from unstructured text data (from medical notes such as discharge summaries) to assist in diagnosing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The LVEF is an essential diagnostic component in rendering a heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) diagnosis. It is also used as a prognostic indicator of cardiovascular outcomes and a monitoring tool to assess response to therapeutic interventions. We are using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset for this project. Lastly, we will assess how well this tool works by computing its precision, recall and accuracy. 


### Introduction 
Heart failure is the primary reason for preventable hospital stays in the elderly population in the US. Unfortunately, it is also associated with significant mortality and morbidity with a projected cost of ~70 billion dollars by 2030. While the reason for the associated morbidity and mortality is multifactorial, failure to adhere to guideline-directed trial-proven medical regimen and underdiagnosis of heart failure both play significant contributory roles leading to poor cardiovascular outcomes including higher mortality. 

Herein, we are seeking to improve both the early recognition and the time to diagnosis to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) diagnosis by leveraging unstructured data in the electronic health record (EHR). Specifically, we are seeking to extract the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) which is a critical diagnostic AND prognostic indicator of heart failure status and cardiovascular outcomes from clinical notes (e.g., outside hospital discharge summary notes). Moreover,it is used to guide therapeutic management including the implementation of guideline-directed medical regimen (GDMT).

The LVEF is obtained following assessment of the cardiac function with an echocardiogram. While it can be documented in table format from the echocardiogram report, more often than not, it is documented in free-text clinical notes or reports. This is particularly true for patients that are coming from other hospitals where it is not feasible to transfer echocardiogram DICOM images to the receiving hospital, further impeding appropriate and timely patient care.


### Methods
For this project, we are using MIMIC-III which is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. This is a vast dataset with many variables and limited access. It comes in form of various datasets which were then cleaned. 

Method: Step 1: Getting access to the MIMIC-III dataset which is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. It comes in form of many variables in various data tables.

Step 2: Querying and cleaing the data. Merge pertinent datasets together. Provide a descriptive analysis including basic demographics of the MIMIC-III dataset. 

Step 3: Defying case and cohort of for the population based on ICD 9 codes. Case definition for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was adapted from https://phekb.org/ and modified. 

Step 4: Querying notes associated with HFrEF encoded encounters. Developping and then applying open-source NLP tools to encode and retrieve LVEF.

Step 5: Lastly, we evaluated how well the predictive power of rule logic using accuracy, precision, and recall.

#Explaination of codes
#Applying NLP using Python codes to encode for/extract left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) for the cohorts. 
```{r eval = TRUE}
#Upon further investigation of the "text" column, one notices that the LVEF value is often listed in a paragraph with a heading for left ventricle systolic function or within a table format listing the LVEF. At times, it is located within the body of the paragraph. As such, we adopted recently published work from Wagholikar et al. ( https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-018-1066-7), edited and modified it for our project. Please see our codes in python for further details.

#For our project, the logic remains consistent in that it will retrieve the left ventricular ejection fraction by searching a tab for 1) a tabular pattern, 2) a section for the left ventricle with numerical and range patterns, and 3) qualitative expressions in decreasing order of precedence. Please see our codes in python for further details.

```

#Conclusion
Using our rule logic NLP tool, it is feasible to extract the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from unstructured data such as free-text medical notes such as physician notes, clinic notes, discharge summaries, clinical reports. It has great accuracy (0.79), precision (0.86), recall (0.97) and F-1 score (0.91). This tool can be integrated into existing platforms to assist with time to HF diagnosis and early recognition of HFrEF.  

#Limitations 
There are several limitations including case and control ICD9-based definition, patient population selection, data formats. Particularly, ICD9 codes can underestimate or overestimate a specific disease condition within a population as it is primarily used for billing and not for diagnostic purposes. It often does not reflect a true representation of a specific disease phenotype. As for patient population selection, we used a ICU cohort which is inherently a different population than patients that are on the stepdown units and/or are being followed outpatient. Lastly, while our NLP rule logic is fairly accurate, it can certainly further improved on and expanded on.
