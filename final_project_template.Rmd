### Overview
Food insecurity, or a "lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life", is a major public health issue in the United States, where approximately 11% of households experienced food insecurity in 2018 (1). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishes a Food Environment Atlas, which contains data on over 275 variables with respect to food insecurity, including access to food retail, use of government food assistance programs, health and socioeconomic indicators, etc. These data are collected from various sources, span several years and geographic levels, and have been made publicly available. The goal of this project is to assess how the food retail environment varies across space, and assess the relationship between food access and other indicators such as race, income, food assistance, and health outcomes variables. Geospatial differences will be analyzed, with a specific focus on Philadelphia in comparision to 1) other counties in Pennsylvania, and 2) Baltimore, MD, another large urban county recommended as a suitable comparison by Moriah Hall, a faculty consultant.

### Introduction
In the United States, approximately 11% of households were food insecure in 2018 (1). In Philadelphia, this rate is nearly double the national average at 18.3%, and more than one out of every five Philadelphian struggles with basic food access (2). Food insecurity contributes to the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, both of which are two of the United State’s top ten leading causes of death (3). Additionally, food insecurity affects children’s cognitive development, and their ability to excel in school (4). Thus, food insecurity has long-lasting impacts on the productivity of a population, and understanding the regional factors that contribute to food insecurity and adverse health outcomes is vital for creating effective local and national interventions. 

A food secure environment provides both physical and financial access to nutritious food. By analyzing the food retail environment in context of socioeconmic factors and government assistance programs, this project spans the disciplines of sociology, economics, geography, public policy, and public health. Based on consulting with Dr. Alyson Karpyn, an analysis on a vulnerable but previously under-researched population, senior citizens, has also been incorporated. Another consultant, Moriah Hall, suggested doing a comparison of Philadelphia, PA to Baltimore, MD, a peer urban county. This project thus aims to use a multidisciplinary approach to understanding regional-specific factors influencing food insecurity, and in doing so, may provide critical insight on how to tackle food insecurity in the United States.

### Methods

#### Downloading data and necessary packages
The main data set used for this project was obtained from the USDA's publicly available data on the [Food Environment Atlas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/). The downloaded Excel file contained several sheets pertinent to this project and have been loaded into R as a list of dataframes called "mysheets". These dataframes contain county-specific information on access and proximity to food retail providers (grocery stores, convenience stores, farmers' markets, etc), food assistance usage, food insecurity rates, diabetes and obesity rates, and socioeconomic indicators including race, age, income, etc. 

To create maps, the counties polygon dataset from BMIN503 Assignment 5 has been downloaded and used.

All necessary packages will be installed and loaded first.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Installations
install.packages("readxl")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Load libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(leaflet)
```

The data downloaded has been saved into the working directory and is loaded into R. Note that names of some of the sheets were slightly modified in Excel to exclude spaces and make them R-compatible.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Load in data
#The following function allows one to read in multiple sheets from one Excel file into a list, with each sheet representing a separate dataframe within the list.
read_excel_allsheets <- function(filename, tibble = TRUE) {
    sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(filename)
    x <- lapply(sheets, function(X) readxl::read_excel(filename, sheet = X))
    if(!tibble) x <- lapply(x, as.data.frame)
    names(x) <- sheets
    x
}
mysheets <- read_excel_allsheets("USDAFoodEnvironmentAtlasMarch2018.xls")
head(mysheets$ACCESS) #to check that data has been loaded properly
```

Load in the counties polygon dataset to use for creating maps.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
counties <- readRDS(gzcon(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimesGroup/BMIN503/master/DataFiles/uscounties_2010.rds")))
```

The following themes will be used throughout the report for generating maps. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#For static maps:
myPalette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "YlOrRd"))

my_theme <- function() {
  theme_minimal() +                                  
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),                 
        axis.text = element_blank(),                 
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "white"),  
        legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "cm"),          
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),       
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12))      
}

#For interactive maps:
# Select a color palette with which to run the palette function
pal_fun2 <- colorNumeric("YlOrRd", NULL)    # Yellow-Orange-Red from RColorBrewer
```

#### Cleaning data

The next step is to clean the data using the dplyr and tidyverse packages. Each dataframe will be updated to only include variables that will be analyzed in this project.

Further analyses will be conducted in the Results section. 

### Results
To address food insecurity, interventions need to address three main facets: 1) availability of food; 2) access to food; and 3) utilization of food. Availability of healthy, nutritious food is impacted by the physical food retail environment of a neighborhood. Are there grocery stores, farmers' markets, or other avenues through which residents can acquire food? Access refers to both physical availability of food, but also the financial ability to acquire the food. How expensive are basic food items? Are there stores that accept government assistance benefits such as SNAP or WIC that individuals can use to purchase food? Utilization of food refers to individuals actually purchasing and consuming healthy food items. Although this dataset does not have any comsumption data, we can use redemption of SNAP and WIC benefits as a proxy for utilization, as these food assistance programs have restrictions on the types of food individuals can purchase with them. The next few sections will assess some of these questions and issues.

#### Lay of the land: state of food insecurity in the United States
The map below shows the three-year household food insecurity average for each state from 2013-2015. What immediately jumps out is that most states in the US have faily high insecurity rates of above 10%. The situation is particularly dire the southern United States with rates generally being 15% or higher, with a few exceptions. States with particularly high food insecurity include: OR, AZ, LA, AL, MO, KY.   

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
Insec1315 <- Insecurity %>%
  select(FIPS, State, County, FOODINSEC_13_15)
Insec1315$GEO_ID <- paste0("0500000US", Insec1315$FIPS)
Insec1315map <- inner_join(counties, Insec1315, by="GEO_ID")

# Pop-up message

                     "<br>Food Insecurity, Three Year Average (2013 - 2015): ", round(Insec1315map$FOODINSEC_13_15, 1))

              fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, # increase opacity and resolution
              popup = pu_Insec1315) %>%                # add a popup message

  addScaleBar()
```

##### Food insecurity: Philadelphia, PA versus Baltimore, MD
One limitation of the three-year food insecurity rates data is that it is at the state level, and we cannot compare Philadelphia to other counties within or outside of PA. However, we can compare the state of Pennsylvania and Maryland. The bar graph below shows that the three-year average in PA and MD are very similar, making them ideal for drawing comparisons across other variables. While the food insecurity rate decreased in Maryland over time, the rate did not change in PA, and it will be interesting to explore other differences between these two states, and specifically between Philadelphia, PA and Baltimore, MD throughout this report. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create dataframe of interested variables
Insec10121315_PM <- Insecurity %>%
  select(FIPS, State, County, FOODINSEC_10_12, FOODINSEC_13_15) %>%
  filter(FIPS %in% c("42101", "24005")) %>%
  rename(Insecurity_2010_2012 = FOODINSEC_10_12, Insecurity_2013_2015 = FOODINSEC_13_15) %>%
  select(-FIPS)

IPM10121315 <- data.frame(State = rep(c("Maryland", "Pennsylvania"), 2),
                   Year = rep(c("2010-2012", "2013-2015"), each=2),
                   Percent = c(Insec10121315_PM$Insecurity_2010_2012, Insec10121315_PM$Insecurity_2013_2015))
  
#Create a bar graph to visualize
ggplot(data = IPM10121315, aes(State, Percent, fill=Year)) + #Load data, specify variables
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") + #Add a visual layer that is a barplot
  labs(title="Food Insecurity, Three Year Average") + labs(x="State", y="Household food insecurity (%) 3 year average")
```

#### Availability of food
In this section, we will explore the food retail environment across the United States. We are using food retail providers such as grocery storesas a proxy to assess availability of food. 

##### Availability of food across the United States
The maps below depict the number of grocery stores, supercenters and club stores, convenience stores, and farmers' markets at the county level relative to the population. 

###### Grocery stores
For the purposes of this dataset, grocery stores included supermarkets, smaller grocery stores, and deli stores. Most counties across the United States have 0.5 or fewer grocery stores per 1000 individuals. Generally, the northern half of the US has more counties with higher numbers of grocery stores. This may be one of the factors that contribute to the lower food insecurity rate in the northern half of the United States. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
Grocery2014 <- Stores %>%
  select(FIPS, State, County, GROCPTH14)
Grocery2014$GEO_ID <- paste0("0500000US", Grocery2014$FIPS)
Grocery2014map <- inner_join(counties, Grocery2014, by="GEO_ID")

# Pop-up message
pu_Grocery2014 <- paste0(Grocery2014map$County, ",", " ", Grocery2014map$State,  # paste0 to append tract name with other relevant text 
                     "<br>Grocery stores/1,000 population, 2014: ", round(Grocery2014map$GROCPTH14, 1))

# Basic leaflet map
leaflet(Grocery2014map) %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, # remove polygon borders
              fillColor = ~pal_fun2(GROCPTH14), # addPolygons requires variable and a pass to a palette function  
              fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, # increase opacity and resolution
              popup = pu_Grocery2014) %>%                # add a popup message
  addTiles() %>%                                         # default basemap
  addLegend("bottomright",                           # location of legend
            pal=pal_fun2,                             # palette function
            values=~GROCPTH14,                 # variable to be passed to palette function
            title = 'Grocery stores/1,000 population, 2014',                  # legend title
            opacity = 1) %>%                         # legend opacity (1 = completely opaque)
  addScaleBar()
```

Looking specifically at Pennsylvania, Philadelphia has a higher number of grocery stores relative to other counties in Pennsylvania. This may be due to how urban Philadelphia is relative to the other counties in PA. 

PA-specific Grocery Stores
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
GroceryPA2014 <- Grocery2014 %>%
  filter(State=="PA")
GroceryPA2014map <- inner_join(counties, GroceryPA2014, by="GEO_ID")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = GroceryPA2014map) + 
  geom_sf(data = GroceryPA2014map, aes(fill = GROCPTH14), lwd = 0) +
  my_theme() +
  ggtitle("County-Level Grocery stores in Pennsylvania, 2014") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Grocery stores/1000 population", colours = myPalette(100))
```

###### Supercenters and club stores
Generally, the eastern half of the US appears to have higher numbers of supercenters and club stores relative to the western half. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
Super2014 <- Stores %>%
  select(FIPS, State, County, SUPERCPTH14)
Super2014$GEO_ID <- paste0("0500000US", Super2014$FIPS)
Super2014map <- inner_join(counties, Super2014, by="GEO_ID")

# Pop-up message
pu_Super2014 <- paste0(Super2014map$County, ",", " ", Super2014map$State,  # paste0 to append tract name with other relevant text 
                     "<br>Supercenters and club stores/1,000 population, 2014: ", round(Super2014map$SUPERCPTH14, 4))

# Basic leaflet map
leaflet(Super2014map) %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, # remove polygon borders
              fillColor = ~pal_fun2(SUPERCPTH14), # addPolygons requires variable and a pass to a palette function  
              fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, # increase opacity and resolution
              popup = pu_Super2014) %>%                # add a popup message
  addTiles() %>%                                         # default basemap
  addLegend("bottomright",                           # location of legend
            pal=pal_fun2,                             # palette function
            values=~SUPERCPTH14,                 # variable to be passed to palette function
            title = 'Supercenters and club stores/1,000 population, 2014',                  # legend title
            opacity = 1) %>%                         # legend opacity (1 = completely opaque)
  addScaleBar()
```

Relative to other counties in Pennsylvania, there are relatively few superstores and club centers in Philadelphia. Again, this may be due to how urban Philadelphia is. Rural counties may have the larger land scapes required for large warehouse stores such as superstores and club centers.

PA-specific Supercenters/club stores
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
SuperPA2014 <- Super2014 %>%
  filter(State=="PA")
SuperPA2014map <- inner_join(counties, SuperPA2014, by="GEO_ID")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = SuperPA2014map) + 
  geom_sf(data = SuperPA2014map, aes(fill = SUPERCPTH14), lwd = 0) +
  my_theme() +
  ggtitle("County-Level Supercenters and club stores in Pennsylvania, 2014") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Supercenters and club stores/1000 population", colours = myPalette(100))
```

###### Convenience stores
Other than a few counties that are exceptions, most of the US is relatively uniform in distribution with respect to the number of ceonvenience stores. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
Conv2014 <- Stores %>%
  select(FIPS, State, County, CONVSPTH14)
Conv2014$GEO_ID <- paste0("0500000US", Conv2014$FIPS)
Conv2014map <- inner_join(counties, Conv2014, by="GEO_ID")

# Pop-up message
pu_Conv2014 <- paste0(Conv2014map$County, ",", " ", Conv2014map$State,  # paste0 to append tract name with other relevant text 
                     "<br>Convenience stores/1,000 population, 2014: ", round(Conv2014map$CONVSPTH14, 4))

# Basic leaflet map
leaflet(Conv2014map) %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, # remove polygon borders
              fillColor = ~pal_fun2(CONVSPTH14), # addPolygons requires variable and a pass to a palette function  
              fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, # increase opacity and resolution
              popup = pu_Conv2014) %>%                # add a popup message
  addTiles() %>%                                         # default basemap
  addLegend("bottomright",                           # location of legend
            pal=pal_fun2,                             # palette function
            values=~CONVSPTH14,                 # variable to be passed to palette function
            title = 'Convenience stores/1,000 population, 2014',                  # legend title
            opacity = 1) %>%                         # legend opacity (1 = completely opaque)
  addScaleBar()
```

There are relatively fewer convenience stores in Eastern Pennslyvania compared to western Pennsylvania. I would have expected urban areas like Philadelphia to have a higher density of convenience stores than rural counties, so this finding is a bit surprising. 

PA-specific convenience stores
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
ConvPA2014 <- Conv2014 %>%
  filter(State=="PA")
ConvPA2014map <- inner_join(counties, ConvPA2014, by="GEO_ID")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ConvPA2014map) + 
  geom_sf(data = ConvPA2014map, aes(fill = CONVSPTH14), lwd = 0) +
  my_theme() +
  ggtitle("County-Level Convenience stores in Pennsylvania, 2014") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Convenience stores/1000 population", colours = myPalette(100))
```

##### Farmers' markets
The northwestern half of the US has relatively higher numbers of farmers' markets. This may influence the relatively lower rates of food insecurity in these counties. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create new dataframe with variables of interest
Farmers2016 <- Local %>%
  select(FIPS, State, County, FMRKTPTH16)
Farmers2016$GEO_ID <- paste0("0500000US", Farmers2016$FIPS)
Farmers2016map <- inner_join(counties, Farmers2016, by="GEO_ID")

# Pop-up message
pu_Farmers2016 <- paste0(Farmers2016map$County, ",", " ", Farmers2016map$State,  # paste0 to append tract name with other relevant text 
                     "<br>Farmers' market/1,000 population, 2016: ", round(Farmers2016map$FMRKTPTH16, 4))

# Basic leaflet map
leaflet(Farmers2016map) %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, # remove polygon borders

In Pennsylvania, the counties immediately surrounding Philadelphia have fewer farmers' markets. This may be due to the efforts of The Food Trust and other non-profit organizations, as well as the Department of Public Health, in promoting interventions involving farmers' markets in Philadelphia.

##### Comparison of Food Retail Environment: Philadelphia, PA versus Baltimore, MD 
With the exception of grocery stores, Baltimore has a larger presence of stores serving food than Philadelphia relative to the population. This may account for the lower food insecurity rate observed in Baltimore, MD. However, Philadelphia has nearly double the number of grocery stores as Baltimore relative to population. This may highlight the important of not only providing availability of food, but also phhysical and financial access to food. Philadelphia's grocery stores may be less physically accessible, or more expensive than Baltimore's. We will explore these questions in the subsequence sections. 
(Note: I have not included farmers' market in this graph because the data are from 2016, whereas the data for the other retail stores are from 2014.)

#### Access to food
In this section, we will explore physical and financial access to food.

##### Physical access to food
The dataset contains information about the number of people with low access to food. Low access in this study is defined as living more than 1 mile from a supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store if in an urban area, or more than 10 miles if in a rural area. It also contains information about factors that might affect low access, such as income, age, and race.

###### Low Access to Stores
The map below shows the percent popluation with low access to stores in 2015 across the US. The western United States has higher percentage of individuals with low access to stores. What's intriguing is that areas with low access to stores do not all overlap with areas of high food insecurity. For example, the northwestern part of the US has relatively lower food insecurity rates, yet there are many counties in this region with a high percentage of the population having low access to grocery stores. 
One limitation of this Access dataset is that only large grocery stores and supermarkets were considered, and many individuals may use other retail options, such as convenience stores, to meet their regular grocery needs.

                   Percent = c(17.5, 3.98, 2.52, 1.21, 0.158, 0.221))

#Create a bar graph to visualize

  labs(title="Relationship Between Age and Access to Stores in Philadelphia and Baltimore 2015") + labs(x="Age Group", y="Percent (%) Population with Low Access to Stores")
```
To test association: chi-squared test?

```
I'm surpised to see that relative to other counties in PA, Philadelphia rate is pretty low. In fact the immediate counties surrounding Philly have higher rates.

  labs(title="Relationship Between Race and Access to Stores in Philadelphia and Baltimore 2015") + labs(x="Race", y="Percent (%) Population with Low Access to Stores")
```
Would've expeted the rate to be higher in minority populations like Blacks and Hispanics. Not white.

Note that this is state level data. Interesting that NM stands out. Is there some policy that makes it so? How does this compare to insecurity levels and SNAP-authorized stores? Redemption?

PHL vs BALT SNAP Participants comparison
```{r, eval=TRUE}
#Create dataframe of interested variables
SNAPPar2016_PHLBAL <- Assistance %>%
  select(FIPS, County, PCT_SNAP16) %>%
  filter(FIPS %in% c("42101", "24005")) %>%
  rename(SNAP = PCT_SNAP16) %>%
  select(-FIPS)

#Create a bar graph to visualize
ggplot(data = SNAPPar2016_PHLBAL, aes(x=County, y=SNAP)) + #Load data, specify variables
    geom_bar(stat="identity") + #Add a visual layer that is a barplot
  labs(title="SNAP Participants (% of Population) in Philadelphia and Baltimore 2016") + labs(x="County", y="SNAP Participants (% of Population)")
```

PHL vs BALT WIC Participants comparison
```{r, eval=TRUE}

Perhaps a table format would be more meaningful for SNAP and WIC particpants in each city.
