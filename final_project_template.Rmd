Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers.

### Overview
My project is hinged on the COVID19 and the unclear testing statistics subject not only to the U.S. but other countries as well. It is has been an uncertainty to others as administrations build their statistics on commendatory perspectives rather than the practical actuality. This project will shed light on this and hopefully provide a rational answer to not only me but whoever is confused and curious on the belief. I will be using primary articles and primary resources online based on the  statistics of the testing ratio in several states as well as a few countries. I have spoken with the following:

### Introduction 
The calculation of the prevalence rates and general statistics of the COVID19 Pandemic has been an area of confusion, with administration preferring to relay the statistics that give a favourable outlook, instead of the reality. The project is interested in observing the test ratio for the COVID19 pandemic as a statistic of interest in the pandemic. The project will aim at conducting a comparative study of the testing being done in different countries with special focus in the test ratios among positive and negative diagnoses.
Given that the pandemic itself is an epidemiological event, the field of epidemiology will make significant contribution to the study, in addition to the fields of statistics, demography and spatial studies. 


### Methods

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
options(width = 400)
```  

```{r}
## LOading the data set
covid19 <- read.csv("covid19.csv")
## viewing the first and the last five rows of the data set
head(covid19)
tail(covid19)
```

```{r}
## checking missing values
sum(is.na(covid19))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = covid19) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Deaths...100.Cases, y = Recovered...100.Cases))
```
### Results
The above graph shows that there exist a positive relationship between the deaths/100 cases and recovered/100 cases. Furthermore, we also observe that the recovery rate is higher than the death rate.
