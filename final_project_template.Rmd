### Overview
##### Discovery of CKD patient subtypes with differential risk profiles is essential for improving health promotion strategies and precision medicine approaches in the prevention and treatment of kidney function decline and prediction of clinical outcomes.  Using baseline data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, including demographic, clinical history, kidney function, anthropometric/ nutritional, functional scores, vascular, medication usage, together with novel biochemical markers, we aim to create CKD subtypes with unsupervised cluster analysis algorithms.

### Introduction
##### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 15% of adults in the United States and is a major cause of end-stage-renal-disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. The estimated crude U.S. prevalence rate of stage 3 and 4 CKD was 7.0% in 2011-14, along with higher percentage of symptomatic and asymptomatic stage 1 and 2 CKD. The goal of CKD treatment and management is to delay disease progression, and minimize and prevent complications. Thus, it is important to address the heterogenity within CKD population and to identify the unobservable patient subgroups featured with different risk factor profiles. Discovery of the unique clusters among people with CKD will potentially provide insights to outcome prognosis, disease pathophysiology, and prevention strategies. 

##### Revealing the latent clusters within CKD patients is an interdisciplinary research question that requires input from both renal pathophysiology and bioinformatics. CKD subgroups are traditionally based on the two common existing kidney markers of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and microalbuminuria, which classifies patients on their impaired kidney function. However, patients with the same impaired kidney function does not necessarily have the same contributing disease pathophysioloy. Thus, the use of high-dimensional data, including risk factors and early disease biomarkers, with machine learnign algorithm will allow us to construct meaningful patients clusters that discriminate disease risks and add more information to the existing patients classification. Also, the data-driven consensus clustering approach makes less assumption about the data and is hypothesis free, which is more flexible to use with complex data structure.


### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
