### Overview

I am interested in exploring in a pilot, feasibility study, the relative utility of machine learning vs "traditional" generalized linear models, and of structured vs. unstructured data in predicting clinical outcomes among patients admitted to the hospital with critical illness. I will explore this question using the [MIMIC-III dataset](https://mimic.physionet.org/).

I plan to meet with the following faculty members to explore this problem:

* Scott Halpern, MD, PhD, Associate Professor, Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division
* Lyle Ungar, PhD, Professor, Department of Computer and Information Science
* Rebecca Hubbard, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology


### Introduction 

Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is costly, places strain on busy health systems, and may not be matched with patient preferences. Predictive models of newly hospitalized patients could provide early identification of patients at risk of death or a prolonged ICU stay. Such a model could prompt early discussions of limitations on life-sustaining therapy, or be used to efficiently allocate hospital resources. Prior work on such predictive models has relied on structured data from laboratory results, vital signs, demographic, and adminstrative sources.

Our goal is to incorporate unstructured text data from clinical notes into these predictive models and assess the feasibility and utility of using such data sources. This investigation requires collaboration between practicing clinicians, hospital policymakers, statisticians, and experts in machine learning and natural language processing. From meetings with various faculty members I have learned about: 1) approaches for cross-validation of discrete time-series predictive models using longitudinal with repeated observations, and 2) the role of differential language analysis, including open- and closed-vocabulary methods to extract meanginful features from unstructured text data.


### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
