### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer provides critical information about tumor response. The I-SPY1 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging and Molecular Analysis) integrated clinical and imaging data to evaluate and predict pathologic complete response(PCR) and recurrence-free survival(RFS) based on MRI imaging, and the data from I-SPY1 TRIAL consists of image data, clinical and outcome data for locally advanced breast cancer patients. My ultimate goal is to use these data to find the relationship and predictability of PCR and RFS based on tumor biomarkers, as well as evaluate the ability of MRI for prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 

### Introduction 
In the first paragraph, describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

In the second paragraph, explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a common treatment that used to treat woman with invasive breast cancer, and it has shown to reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery and siginificant overall survival outcomes. There is a positive association between change of primary tumor size in response to chemotheray and overall survival, therefore, the size change of primary tumor can be regarded as a biomarker for breast cancer. Thus, monitoring tumor response can provide prediction of PCR and RFS toneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Current clinical assessment of tumor response to radiation or chemotherapy and therapeutic efficacy can be obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the indication of changes in tumor morphology resulted from the molecular changes to tumor tissue. 
The purpose of this project is to find the relationship of PCR and RFS based on tumor biomarkers assessed by MRI, and compare MRI data and clinical assessment for prediction of pathologic response for patients received neoadjuvant chemotheray to test the prediction ability of MRI. 

To address this problem, multidisciplinary approach is required. Understanding pathophysiology of breast cancer will be helpful to interpret clinical assessments of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as well as histopathologic analysis of surgical specimens. Having knowledge in MR imaging technique as well as knowledge in MR image data assessment is also necessary to understand image data of tumor response to chemotherapy. Finally, statistics will serve as a key input for the overall study to not only show the data graphically, but also explore data among important issues, and make correctly and properly inference. Thus, the probelm addressed in this project is interdisciplinary.




### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
