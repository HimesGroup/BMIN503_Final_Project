### Overview
Literature on Gene expression studies in cigarette smokers are abundant and most have identified several dysregulated molecular
pathways that can alter respiratory health of a smoker or increase their risk of developing chronic conditions. However, there is a lack of literature on similar and/or parallel studies in marijuana smokers, partly because there are high chances of concurrent cigarette smoking whcih acts as a confounder in determining effect. S. Sharma and C. Liu et al hypothesized that studying difference in expression of alveolar macrophage (AM) 
between Marijuana and cigarette smokers can identify disease pathways that may influence respiratory disease development among those exposed to cannabis smoke.


### Introduction 
Recently as many US states legalized recreational marijuana use, while policy makers are trying to restrict access of cannabis vaping among teenagers because of evidence of respiratory implications of cannabis vaping. Hence it has become increasingly important to study effect of cannabis smoke exposure and its association with potential respiratory disease related gene expression. 

[This study](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2018.197.1_MeetingAbstracts.A4161) by S. Sharma and C. Liu et al, could potentially identify genes and pathways which would give additional insight into mechanisms that influence cannabis-associated respiratory diseases and if it differs greatly from those exposed to cigarette smoke or no smoke.

This study is at the intersection of public health, Bioinformatics and Biomedical genetics and should draw insight from these fields for a deeper understanding of the effects of cannabis smoking on a molecular level in the general population.


### Methods
I will be utilizing the raw data for this study available in the GEO database, accession [GSE155213](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155213)
