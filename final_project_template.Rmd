### Overview
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles in various locations throughout a city. The process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations. At these docking stations, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different location within a specific time period. All major cities have a bike share system. Philadelphia's bike share system is called Indego. 

### Introduction 
Indego is a public bike sharing system in Philadelphia, PA that has docking stations throughout the city. Users can sign up for various types of passes such as annual, monthly, daily, hourly, etc. and are able to leave the bikes at a different station from where they undocked. Predicting the demand for bikes at different locations throughout the city is difficult. Improper distribution of bikes across the city, due to poor predictions, leaves some stations with not enough bikes and others with too many. Furthermore, there are several neighborhoods that do not readily have access to any docking station. The goal of my project is to develop a model using random forests to accurately predict demand. Specifically, I would like to predict demand in new areas that docking stations were recently installed as described in the next paragraph.

Spatial distribution of docking stations has become an increasing problem in many cities. During my discussion with Dr. Michelle Johnson, who utilized the bike share system Capital Bikeshare when she lived in Washington DC, stated the docking stations tend to be more concentrated in areas with predominantly white populations. “One of the previous assumptions about bike share was that the reason lower-income communities of color were not using it was due to a lack of interest,” says Dr. Johnson. This assumption, however, is wrong according to Dr. Johnson, who believes that minority groups have a favorable view and interest in bike sharing. Philadelphia added several new docking stations in neighborhoods that are predominately non-white in the past few years. Using the data gathered in the past year to predict demand in the new neighborhoods will allow us to see if the demographics of users are changing. If the results show that the new docking stations will be just as popular as the old ones, then this study can serve as an impetus for other cities to also build docking stations in underrepresented neighborhoods. 

This study is interdisciplinary because it concerns urban planning, transportation and health. Results from this study can contribute to all these fields and give more insight into where demand will be greatest. This can help urban planners in cities that are planning to build new or improve existing bike share systems. By studying the demographics of different areas, different health insights of various populations can be derived. 


### Methods
Draft:
The data that will be used for this final project will come from Philadelphia’s bike share website. This data is publicly available, however there was a system failure and I was unable to access the data. I contacted Allan Wenches, who is the leads the operations of Indego, and he sent me the appropriate data. 

My approach will begin with exploring the data to gain a complete picture of what is provided. I will then create a test and training datasets from what is provided. I will check for any missing values. I will then create histograms and other relevant plots to visually depict distributions of different variables provided in the dataset. I’ll then do hypothesis testing using multivariate analysis. Using the library ‘rpart’ I’ll make a decision tree algorithm, from which I’ll predict the bike demand. 
 


### Results
Draft:
Results will include histograms to visualize numeric variables given in dataset, boxplots to show differences between categorical variables, a decision tree used to model the prediction. The conclusion will include prediction on the bike demand in different areas. This information can help determine where new bike stations should be built throughout Philadelphia.
