### Overview

This project investigates the structural brain change resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI), 
specifically probing for a reliable measure to quantify the severity of TBI, which is agnostic to 
the type and location of the trauma. The aim is to quantify structural brain volumes, to identify 
regions with disease-related atrophy, and to compare the relative distribution of brain volume in 
TBI stubjects against normal controls.

The data was collected by the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is a large-scale, prospective, 
population-based, observational cohort study. Voluntary participants were recruited across the 
United Kingdom, between 2006-2010. Extensive baseline data was collected, including questionnaires 
about health and lifestyle, anthropometric measures, biological samples, and samples for genetic 
analysis. Neuroimaging data was collected using a 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Skyra, Siemens 
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel radio frequency receiver head coil. The T1 imaging 
sequence used a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (voxel: 1 x 1 x 1 mm; 
matrix: 208 x 256 x 256; inversion time: 880 msec; repetition time: 2000 msec). This research has 
been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 35148.

### Introduction 
Each year, 1.5 million Americans sustain a traumatic brain injury, which is the cause of a 
long-term disability in 80,00-90,000 people [1]. Yet, there is no quantifiable measure that 
can differentiate between those people who recover and those who suffer from a long-term 
disability. For that reason, it is more difficult for those people with a disability to qualify 
for the services that they need to deal with their injury. The tau pathology in chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy is well documented post-mortem [2], but there is currently no in vivo 
method for quantifying the severity of a traumatic brain injury or diagnosing a patient with CTE.

This project takes advantage of computer vision to address a clinical problem. Using feature 
extraction from medical image analysis, it is possible to use a data-driven approach to evaluate 
abnormal regions of interest and to calculate a non-specific measure of disease-related brain change.

### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
