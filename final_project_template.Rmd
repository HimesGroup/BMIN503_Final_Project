### Overview
For this project, we are seeking to determine the feasibility, diagnostic and predictive power of unstructured text data (from medical notes) to diagnose heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We are using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset for this project. Specifically, we are seeking to determine the feasibility of extracting pertinent components of the unstructured text of medical note (e.g. discharge summary) using natural language processing (NLP) methods to assist in making a heart failure diagnosis. Secondarily, we aim to compare the diagnostic and predictic power of the unstructured text to conventional factors in making a heart failure diagnosis. 

### Introduction 
Heart failure (HF) is a progressive clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood. It carries a poor prognosis with 50% mortality within the first 5 years of diagnosis, and is associated with significant co-morbidity and remarkable decrease in quality of life and functional status. Unfortunately, recent data suggest HF-associated mortality and morbidity are on the rise. While the reason for the HF-related poor outcomes is multifactorial, underdiagnosis and time-sensitive diagnosis play a significant contributory role leading to poor cardiovascular outcomes. This is mainly because the diagnosis of heart failure is a clinical and thus, it requires compilation of various data points including detailed and thorough history and physical exam.


### Methods
For this project, we are using MIMIC-III which is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. This is a vast dataset with many variables and limited access. It comes in form of various datasets which were then cleaned. Datatables containing basic demographics, ICD codes and note events were then merged. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) definition (using definition from https://phekb.org/  was used to define case and control populations. 

#Retrieving datatables
```{r eval = TRUE}

library(magrittr)
library(pROC)
NOTEEVENTS <- read.csv("~/Downloads/NOTEEVENTS.csv", comment.char="#")

DIAGNOSES_ICD <- read.csv("~/Downloads/DIAGNOSES_ICD_3.csv", header=TRUE)
ADMISSIONS <- read.csv("~/Downloads/ADMISSIONS.csv", header=TRUE)
```

#Query the data, QI and cleaning
```{r eval = TRUE}
#Quering the dataset

#uniquep <-length(unique(PATIENTS$SUBJECT_ID)) #46,520 unique subject IDs
#uniquens <-length(unique(NOTEEVENTS$SUBJECT_ID)) #46146 unique subject IDs

#Duplicates in subject ID for patient dataset.
