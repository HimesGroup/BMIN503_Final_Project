Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, but this is not required.

### Overview
Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

> My research project will answer the question, can common risk-factors and patient demographic data be used to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients? For this research question, we will use a dataset of ~27,000 patients from the Unniversity of Pennsylvania Health System with well characterized risk factors for AKI and labeled outcome of AKI or no AKI. This dataset is provided by DEBI faculty member Todd Miano.

> I will discuss this project with Todd Miano, PharmD, PhD, DBEI, Critical Care Pharmacist and John Holmes, PhD, Professor of Medical Informatics in Epidemiology, who has experience in AKI prediction, machine learning projects. 

A git repo for this project is available [here](https://github.com/HaediThelen/BMIN503_Final_Project). 

### Introduction 
Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.


### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
