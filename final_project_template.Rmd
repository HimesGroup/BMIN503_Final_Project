Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation in class will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name and text below with your own, but leave the headers.

### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

This project will explore what factors are associated with participation in a weekly produce box program in an outpatient pediatric clinic setting. Existing EHR and programmatic datasets will be merged to determine whether, for example, those screening food insecure are more or less likely to participate in the program and which characteristics (zip code, age of child, referring provider, etc.), correlate with participation. These questions are of particular interest as health systems seek to address social determinants of health, including food insecurity, through interventions with little idea of which types of programs are effective and for which populations.

Moriah Hall (MPH Program Associate Director): We discussed the various barriers that might keep someone from participating in a hospital produce program. She also suggested I consider adding a qualitative portion to this quantitative analysis for a potential mixed methods capstone project. 

Rebecca Hubbard (Associate Professor of Biostatistics, CCEB): I originally intended to look at program participation (outcome) as both a dichotomous and a continuous variable, with the latter representing the number of instances of participation.  Based on my (small) sample size, however, Dr. Hubbard suggested that I avoid looking at my outcome as a continuous measure, perhaps creating 3-4 categories of participation for analysis in addition to ever/never.  She also recommeded I use GEE analysis rather than basic logistic regression.  Finally, we discussed using either CART of LASSO for  any prediction modeling as they both provide output coefficients that other models (random forest, etc) would not.

Carolyn Cannuscio (Director of Research for the Center for Public Health Initiatives): no response.

### Introduction 
In the first paragraph, describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

Recently, and especially thanks to the ACA, healthcare systems are placing increasing focus on addressing the social determinants of health (food security, housing, etc.) of their patients in addition to their medical issues.  This stems from evidence showing that social factors play a much greater role in health (40-75%) than does healthcare provision (10%).  Research on which interventions are best suited for which populations are scant, however, especially as regards food insecurity.

In the second paragraph, explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

This approach to health is necessarilily interdisciplinary, as it brings together clinicians with social service providers to address health outcomes via a public health lens.  Each brings knowledge to the issue of food insecurity, but efforts will only be successful if evaluation is conducted that shows intervention programs truly impact the health of recipients.  This requires both quantitative data exploring the details of participation, but also qualitative analysis to understand what is ultimately a socially driven problem.  As is often the case with interventions, program data is collected without forethought for how it will be analyzed which seriously limits what conclusions can be drawn and requires methods that take the provenance and shortcomings of the data into consideration. 


### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

Three separate, but related, datasets were merged to incorporate aspects of patient visit information and programmatic data into one complete set.  Descriptive analysis was run on the complete dataset for areas of interest.
The first dataset consisted of a food insecurity (FI) registry drawn from the EHR containing visit records of all patients screened for FI at any point beginning in April 2012, when the two item screener was incorporated into the EHR, thru October 2017.The registry contained 79,286 observations of 30 variables, including demographics, referral, provider, location, and insurance information, health stats, and all diagnoses associated with each visit.  This registry contained 16,297 distinct patient visits, comprised of 11,438 distinct patients.
The second dataset was drawn from the same EHR and containted visit records of all patients who received a referral to the produce program between February 2015, when the referral was added to the EHR, thru October 2017.  This registry contained 14,492 obvservations of the same 30 variables in the FI registry, comprised of 2433 distict patients visits for 2245 distinct patients.
The third dataset was an excel spreadsheet maintained by produce program staff containing any referral written from February 2014 thru October 2017, including paper referrals written prior to and after referral inclusion in the EHR.  This dataset contained 2736 observations of 21 variables, including caregiver contact information, referral provider, location, and date, as well as follow-up and outcomes for each referral.  This dataset contained 2678 distinct patient visits for 2504 distinct patients.

### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
