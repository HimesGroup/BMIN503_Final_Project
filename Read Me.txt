BMIN 503 - Final Project
Calculation of Diagnostic Utility Metrics with a Clustered Study Design

Background: 
Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) are commonly reported and commonly used diagnostic utility metrics for clinical tests. Because of their ubiquity multiple R packages exist which can calculate these metrics for properly formatted data. However, none of these packages can accommodate a clustered study design. This is unfortunate as diagnostic accuracy studies frequently use clustered study designs, most frequently with repeat measurements on the same patient. The purpose of this project is to write a program which can correctly calculate Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV for a diagnostic accuracy study which uses repeat measurements assessed by multiple raters. 

Study Population: 
Four pediatric electrophysiologists measured the Bazett corrected QTc on the same 200 15-lead pediatric ECGs randomly selected from all ECGs read by a pediatric electrophyisologist at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2021. The gold standard will be the QTc as finalized in the patient's chart (to be extracted the GE MUSE ECG database). QTcs will be converted to a dichotomous variable with a cutoff of >=460 ms. The Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV and their respective 95% confidence intervals calculated per the methods described in Kwat et al.
