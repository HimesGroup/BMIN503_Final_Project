# 1 OVERVIEW: 
This study aims to identify any clinical or cytogenetic associations between newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and excess body weight (EBW) in participants of the MMRF CoMMpass study. Data include clinical information at diagnosis including ISS stage, BMI and ECOG performance status and, cytogenetics including whole genome, whole exome and bulk RNA sequencing. We will use BMI as a surrogate marker for excess body weight though it is an imperfect measure of adiposity. Please find my Github Repository for the final project [here](https://github.com/bearazzo/BMIN503_Final_Project).

# 2 INTRODUCTION:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common blood cancer diagnosis, with over 20,000 cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Age, race and genetic factors are known predisposing risk factors, but obesity is the only modifiable characteristic consistently implicated in the development of both MGUS and MM (Carson, Bates, and Tomasson 2014; Landgren et al. 2010; Wallin and Larsson 2011). Persons with excess body weight are 10-20% more likely to develop multiple myeloma, with an estimated number of 12,480 cases attributed to excess body weight in the United States between 2011-2015 (Islami et al. 2019).

The pathophysiological basis of this association is not fully understood, with systemic and marrow immune dysfunction as putative driver mechanisms. Inflammatory pathways include... Possible 

*The way I would introduce it would be OBESITY=> INFLAMMATION => 1) aging (LTL, CHIP) and APOBEC (“viral response”)*
 



# METHODS/RESULTS:

# 3 Data acquisition and BMI distribution
The following sections will introduce the methods used for data acquisition and analyses along with the presentation and discussion of any relevant findings. 

## 3.1 Data Source  
The MMRF CoMMpass database (MMRF in short hereafter) is a study designed to prospectively profile newly diagnosed, treatment naive MM (NDMM) from more than 1000 patients with longitudinal clinical follow up. Tumor specimens collected at diagnosis and relapse are interrogated by whole-exome, modified low pass whole-genome, and or RNA sequencing. The longitudinal component required clinical follow-up of each patient with collection of clinical parameters four times annually over a period of 10 years. Furthermore, each patient participating in the study underwent an IMID and/or Proteasome inhibitor-based treatment regimen at diagnosis determined by the treating hematologist. 

# 3.2 Data loading and wrangling

All libraries and color theme as loaded as follows. XXX spreadsheets containing data extracted between 2018-2020 by Dr. Eileen Boyle (participant in the MMRF, direct download not available to me at the time) were loaded and modified according to the following code. They are all available as .csv on github. Data from 758 of 1273 participants contained height and weight at the time of diagnosis and this subset of patients is primarily used in the following analyses given the focus of this report. Demographic distribution does not significantly differ from the overall cohort (data not shown, previously published in Boyle et. al Leukemia 2021).  

Of all samples available, 980 underwent germline WGS - all were analyzed for clonal hematopoiesis and 911 were analyzed for leukocyte telomere length. There were 848 matching tumor specimens available - 809 underwent tumor WGS (747 analyzed for complex rearrangements and 807 analyzed for tumor telemere length), 848 underwent tumor WES (included analyses for mutations, translocations and CNA) and 683 underwent bulk RNA sequencing. Most patients for which BMI information is available also contributed samples for genetic information as described above.

# 4 Conventional clinical and genetic features and their relationship with BMI distribution

## 4.1 Demographic and clinical data according to BMI

The scatter plot shows a small but statistically significant decline in BMI with older age at diagnosis. Later analyses will need to take this relationship into account, because age has been shown to have significant prognostic implications as previously published by our group (ref). Although there was a trend toward increased mean BMI in males, this was not a statistically significant trend. Similarly, there were no significant variations in BMI distribution according to race. Mean BMI was also not significantly different according to ISS stage at diagnosis.

## 4.3 Characterization of BMI at diagnosis with respect to MM related cytogenetic changes and RNA risk category

In regards to the BMI distribution of the most common MM related translocations, most did not segregate with BMI. Although t(8;14) did appear to have statistically significant distribution with respect to weight, it is a rare translocation often associated with later clonal evolution so unlikely to be a clinically significant finding in regards to newly diagnosed genetic drivers (Tomas LML abstract 2022). 1q gain and 17p deletion are included in newer MM staging systems (R-ISS and R2-ISS) and were obtained in this subset by tumor NGS. Neither appear to change in frequency according to BMI.

Finally, the BMI distribution is also exactly the same across individuals with and without the clinically established high risk RNA risk profiling GEP70 (70 risk genes with high risk defined as score > ≥45.2).

## 4.4 Outcome Summary Statistics

In order to first validate our cohort containing BMI data, I first demonstrated that genetic and clinical data used in NDMM staging (ISS, R-ISS and R2-ISS staging/prognostic systems) I first repeated...

I then explored our clinical data as it relates to survival outcomes...

Though there were no survival differences in outcomes with BMI stratified in the 4 WHO defined categories, I also sought to determine the Cox proportional hazard ratio of BMI in univariate and multivariate analyses given the possible confounding of age and sex. While other clinical and genetic characteristics did not segregate with BMI and are therefore not felt to confound outcomes within BMI cohorts, they were included in some of the multivariate analyses in order to weigh the prognostic features.

# 5. Exploratory genetic features and relationship with BMI distribution in this population

## 5.1 NMF for Apobec signatures

What is APOBEC: "The APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3) family of cytidine deaminases is responsible for two mutational signatures (SBS2 and SBS13) found in cancer genomes. APOBEC3 enzymes are activated in response to viral infection, and have been associated with increased mutation burden and TP53 mutation. (Jakobsdottir BMC Biology 2022)"

Mutational signatures were called using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with counts per sample calculated for the six possible SNV types and the 16 possible 3-base sequence contexts, creating a table with 96 columns. The R package “NMF” was used for all calculations (CRAN - Package NMF). The number of signatures was determined by running 50 iterations of the algorithm for 2-7 signatures. A number of signatures was chosen that maximized the cophenetic distance and dispersion values. One thousand (1,000) iterations of the algorithm were run for that number of signatures. Cosine similarity was used to determine the Sanger signatures that were closest to the detected signatures.

# 7 DISCUSSION:

*TTHIS IS STILL PENDING*

***ORIGINAL ONE FROM EILEEN***
We identified 1143 patients. 1122 had BMI information. The median BMI was 27.3 (13.6-61.6). 2% (n=22) were underweight, 30% (n=340) were within normal range, 38% (n=425) were overweight, and 30% (n=335) were obese. When sub setting the obese population according to WHO: 60% (n=202), were I 28% (n=95) were II, 11% (n=38) were III, and 6% (n=21) were stage IV.

We assessed CH on WGS germline data. We noted that patients with CH had significantly smaller BMIs (27.4 (15.2-41.1) vs 26.4 (19.9-35.7) chi-squared = 4.534, df = 1, p-value = 0.03). *I think this statistic is incorrect*

(Is this not GSEA?) We performed an nNMF in order to identify the APOBEC mutational signature. These was no correlation between BMI and APOBEC mutational signature using BMI as a *continuous variable (F=3, p=0.08)* or *segmented in groups (X2: 2.1, DF=3, p=0.5)*, Figure XXX. 
	
Telomere length has been associated with Aging and chronic aggressions. In myeloma, Tumour Telomere length has been associated with chromothrypsis, age, and an adverse outcome. In order to access the role of obesity, we matched BMI and 887 LTL and 779 TTL derived from WGS. As continuous variables, there were no correlations between BMI and both LTL and TTL. As discrete categories were concerned, there was a significant correlation between *BMI and LTL (for group Chi 12, DF 3, p=0.006)* and WHO classification (13.6 DF5, p=0.01). Interestingly, patients with a higher BMI had longer LTL *(need to correct this data by age though!)*. Of note, there was no linear correlation between Age and BMI in this dataset (F-statistic: 3.225 on 1 and 958 DF,  p-value: 0.07 ). ***(However in the 758 patients with BMI data there does appear to be a correlation)*** 
	In terms of outcome, there were no difference in PFS according to BMI.
