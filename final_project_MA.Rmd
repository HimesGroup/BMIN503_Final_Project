Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation in class will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name and text below with your own, but keep the headers.

### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

The goal is to examine car crash data in Philadelphia in 2008 and 2018, respectively. This project will first obtain and compare the critical factors contributing the fatal car crashes in 2008 and 2018 using machine learning methods. Then, the important factors contributing to the deadly car crashes will be plotted. 


### Introduction 
In the first paragraph, describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

This project utilizes the data provided by the Philadelphia government for all car crashes in 2008 and 2018. Car crashes can be fatal and detrimental to the families of victims. By finding the most critical factors contributing to fatal car crashes, this project could provide a warning and raise the caution to drivers and pedestrians of those factors, and potentially reduce the fatal rate of accidents. 

In the second paragraph, explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Since the car crash data also contains information on observed dangerous driving behaviors, including alcohol consumption, speeding, this data would be useful to study the effect of human psychology and health status on the severity of accidents. 


### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
