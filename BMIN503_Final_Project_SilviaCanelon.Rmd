### Overview

The project makes use of the freely-available MIMIC-III Clinical Database to investigate the characteristics of pregnant patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and their inpatient care. This large dataset of over forty thousand patients admitted to critical care units will be used to identify predictors significantly associated with mortality and/or specific cause of death.

Three faculty/staff being consulted for the project:
- Mary Regina Boland; Assistant Professor of Informatics; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics
- Ray Bai; Postdoctoral Researcher; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics
- Lena Davidson; Data Analyst; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics

### Introduction 

The secondary use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) facilitates retrospective research on data collected during the course of patients' clinical care. The data available through the MIMIC-III Clinical Database provides detailed health-related information collected from a diverse population of patients admitted to intensive care units of a large me dical center, some of whom may have been pregnant at the time of admission. Given the nature of intensive care units, any pregnant patients admitted were likely considered high-risk pregnancies before or at the time of admission. In addition, a subset of these pregnant patients will have deceased or suffered other adverse outcomes during their care, information which can be gleaned through analysis of in-hospital mortality and billing-related information recorded in the EHR. Understanding the characteristics of the pregnant patient population, as well as their care, will shed light on patterns related to adverse outcomes experienced during critical care and hopefully provide preliminary data pertinent to the clinical decison-making process.

The analysis and subsequent interpretation of EHR data is interdisciplinary because it combines domains of the biomedical informatics, epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical fields. Uncovering potential correlations between patient and patient care information and clinical outcomes involves the use of informatics and statistical analysis skills, whereas epidemiology and clinical domains provide the necessary context for defining/refining the analysis approach and interpreting the results. Consultation with all three faculty/staff has confirmed that adverse outcomes among the patient population admitted to critical care are important to understand from a public health perspective, and likely to not be "rare" events given the intensive care unit context, which allows for standard statistical approaches.


### Methods

The Mimic-III Clinic Database contains de-identified health data records for over 40,000 patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of Boston, Massachusetts from 2001 and 2012. The database includes information on demographics, vital sign measurements, laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, billing-related information, and mortality.
Demographic, procedure, mortality, and billing-related information such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes, will be used to explore patient characteristics and care while being treated at Beth Isreal Deaconess Medical Center, and mortality studied as an outcome.

```{r}
# narrowing to only binary variables of interest
patients_recoded_trim_glm <- patients_recoded_trim %>% select(-(AGE_ADM:LOS_ICU))

# logistic regression model
patients_glm <- glm(MORTALITY ~ ., data = patients_recoded_trim_glm, family = binomial(logit))
summary(patients.glm)

# There were signficant positive associations between all insurance types and MORTALITY
```

#### Limitations
- Because all dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality, I could not compare c-section rates to national rates reported by the CDC per year. Reference: https://mimic.physionet.org/mimicdata/time/
  - Date shifting removed:
      - Year - The year is randomly distributed between 2100 - 2200
      - Day of the month - The absolute day of the month is not preserved
      - Inter-patient information - Two patients in the ICU on 2150-01-01 were not in the ICU at the same time
- Not all `ICD9_CODES` in the database match to a ICD code
- Population is mostly older which means fewer pregnancies, so pregnancy-related outcomes are not easily studied
