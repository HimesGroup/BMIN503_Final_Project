AB Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cancer cause of death. To date, only one targeted therapy trial generated positive survival outcomes in a selected population among many targeted therapy trials. This trial showed the addition of trastuzumab to fluoropyrimidine/platinum chemotherapy as first-line chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive GC that resulted in an overall survival (OS) benefit. The increasing use of next generation sequencing approach to genomically profile GC patients allows the identification of many more GC patients who could benefit from specific targeted agents. Here we provide a comprehensive review of targeted therapy trials in GC and discuss future potential actionable driver mutations in GC.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the recent progress in defining the patterns of genetic evolution giving rise to relapse in follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma, and discusses their implications with respect to 'personalized medicine'.; RECENT FINDINGS: High-throughput sequencing studies have uncovered a large degree of clonal heterogeneity within tumors, and found that subclones have a variable contribution to relapse. Recent studies aimed at defining patterns of clonal evolution have revealed that serial tumors in some malignancies share their ancestry in a less evolved common progenitor cell (CPC) that bears only a subset of the mutations that are present in the fully evolved tumors that present clinically. This pattern of 'divergent evolution' means that the majority of 'actionable mutations' in tumor specimens are absent within the progenitors that give rise to relapse.; SUMMARY: Follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma are clinically, biologically and genetically distinct mature B-cell malignancies. However, recent studies have found them to share important similarities in their patterns of genetic evolution. Tumor cells that constitute subclonal populations within these tumors, or between consecutive tumors, share their origins within a genetically less evolved common progenitor cell. This pattern of evolution indicates that current therapies are unable to eradicate these less evolved populations that are at the root of relapse. This suggests that in order to obtain the best results with modern 'targeted therapies' that are directed towards 'actionable mutations', these mutations should be considered within the context of the evolutionary stage at which mutations are acquired, not simply on a presence or absence basis.

AB OBJECTIVES: Feedback should facilitate learning, but within medical education it often fails to deliver on its promise. To better understand why feedback is challenging, we explored the unique perspectives of doctors who had also trained extensively in sport or music, aiming to: (i) distinguish the elements of the response to feedback that are determined by the individual learner from those determined by the learning culture, and (ii) understand how these elements interact in order to make recommendations for improving feedback in medical education.; METHODS: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 doctors or medical students who had high-level training and competitive or performance experience in sport (n=15) or music (n=12). Data were analysed iteratively using constant comparison. Key themes were identified and their relationships critically examined to derive a conceptual understanding of feedback and its impact.; RESULTS: We identified three essential sources of influence on the meaning that feedback assumed: the individual learner; the characteristics of the feedback, and the learning culture. Individual learner traits, such as motivation and orientation toward feedback, appeared stable across learning contexts. Similarly, certain feedback characteristics, including specificity, credibility and actionability, were valued in sport, music and medicine alike. Learning culture influenced feedback in three ways: (i) by defining expectations for teachers and teacher-learner relationships; (ii) by establishing norms for and expectations of feedback, and (iii) by directing teachers' and learners' attention toward certain dimensions of performance. Learning culture therefore neither creates motivated learners nor defines 'good feedback'; rather, it creates the conditions and opportunities that allow good feedback to occur and learners to respond.; CONCLUSIONS: An adequate understanding of feedback requires an integrated approach incorporating both the individual and the learning culture. Our research offers a clear direction for medicine's learning culture: normalise feedback; promote trusting teacher-learner relationships; define clear performance goals, and ensure that the goals of learners and teachers align. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The implementation of patient-centered medical homes has reinforced the need for interprofessional practice as the means to increasing patient quality. The nurse executive is well positioned to facilitate interprofessional collaborative practice; however, more sophisticated and focused strategies are needed for high levels of interprofessional partnerships that wholeheartedly ensure patient-driven health care. This article presents strategies to meet the needs of the patient as the interprofessional team coordinates activities across the continuum. Strategies include having a clear understanding of the patient-centered medical homes concept, clear articulation of patient centricity behaviors, selection of metrics that are actionable, competence in developing high-functioning partnerships, and processes to strengthen the organizational cultural to support interprofessional practice.

AB Coronary artery disease is complex chronic disease best managed by a team empowered by actionable data and a comprehensive approach, the ability to improve intermediate outcomes was dramatically enhanced after Geisinger created a system of care to do so. Continuous measurement of critical data elements of process and intermediate outcome measures allows the delivery of actionable information to the most appropriate team member, including the patients and family as team members. Continuous monitoring of the overall program looking for trends and opportunities across sites and regions allows for program enhancements. The comprehensive "all-or-none" bundled approach to care, which has already realized a 300% improvement, will be further enhanced by incorporating additional "Big Data" flows.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric hearing loss is an increasingly recognized problem with significant implications. Increasing our quantitative understanding of potentially modifiable environmental risk factors for hearing loss may form the foundation for prevention and screening programs.; OBJECTIVE: To determine whether specific threshold exposure levels of personally modifiable risk factors for hearing loss have been defined, with the overarching goal of providing actionable guidance for the prevention of pediatric hearing loss.; DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was performed. Computerized searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were completed and supplemented with manual searches.; REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed to determine specific threshold values of personally modifiable risk factors on hearing loss in the pediatric population. Searches and data extraction were performed by independent reviewers.; RESULTS: There were 38 criterion-meeting studies, including a total of 50,651 subjects. Threshold noise exposures significantly associated with hearing loss in youth included: (1) more than 4 hours per week or more than 5 years of personal headphone usage, (2) more than 4 visits per month to a discotheque, and (3) working on a mechanized farm. Quantified tobacco levels of concern included any level of in utero smoke exposure as well as secondhand exposure sufficient to elevate serum cotinine.; CONCLUSIONS: Specific thresholds analyses are limited. Future studies would ideally focus on stratifying risk according to clearly defined levels of exposure, in order to provide actionable guidance for children and families. © American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2014.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine if the current body of evidence describes specific threshold values of concern for modifiable societal-level risk factors for pediatric hearing loss, with the overarching goal of providing actionable guidance for the prevention and screening of audiological deficits in children.; DATA SOURCES: Three related systematic reviews were performed. Computerized PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library searches were performed from inception through October 2013 and were supplemented with manual searches.; REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed to determine specific threshold values of societal-level risk factors on hearing loss in the pediatric population. Searches and data extraction were performed by independent reviewers.; RESULTS: There were 20 criterion-meeting studies with 29,128 participants. Infants less than 2 standard deviations below standardized weight, length, or body mass index were at increased risk. Specific nutritional deficiencies related to iodine and thiamine may also increase risk, although data are limited and threshold values of concern have not been quantified. Blood lead levels above 10 g/dL were significantly associated with pediatric sensorineural loss, and mixed findings were noted for other heavy metals. Hearing loss was also more prevalent among children of socioeconomically disadvantaged families, as measured by a poverty income ratio less than 0.3 to 1, higher deprivation category status, and head of household employment as a manual laborer.; CONCLUSIONS: Increasing our understanding of specific thresholds of risk associated with causative factors forms the foundation for preventive and targeted screening programs as well as future research endeavors. © American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2014.

AB The treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer has not moved much beyond single agent gemcitabine until recently when protocols such as FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine have demonstrated some improved outcomes. Advances in technology especially in massively parallel genome sequencing has progressed our understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer especially the candidate signalling pathways that are involved in tumourogenesis and disease course. This has allowed identification of potentially actionable mutations that may be targeted by new biological agents. The heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer makes tumour tissue collection important with the aim of being able to personalise therapies for the individual as opposed to a one size fits all approach to treatment of the condition. This paper reviews the developments in this area of translational research and the ongoing clinical studies that will attempt to move this into the everyday oncology practice.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a need for theoretically grounded and evidence-based interventions that enhance the use of research evidence in physical therapist practice. This paper and its companion paper introduce the Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (PEAK) program, an educational program designed to promote physical therapists' integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making. The pedagogical foundations for the PEAK educational program include Albert Bandura's social cognitive theory and Malcolm Knowles's adult learning theory. Additionally, two complementary frameworks of knowledge translation, the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) and Knowledge to Action (KTA) Cycle, were used to inform the organizational elements of the program. Finally, the program design was influenced by evidence from previous attempts to facilitate the use of research in practice at the individual and organizational levels.; DISCUSSION: The 6-month PEAK program consisted of four consecutive and interdependent components. First, leadership support was secured and electronic resources were acquired and distributed to participants. Next, a two-day training workshop consisting of didactic and small group activities was conducted that addressed the five steps of evidence based practice. For five months following the workshop, participants worked in small groups to review and synthesize literature around a group-selected area of common clinical interest. Each group contributed to the generation of a "Best Practices List" - a list of locally generated, evidence-based, actionable behaviors relevant to the groups' clinical practice. Ultimately, participants agreed to implement the Best Practices List in their clinical practice.; SUMMARY: This, first of two companion papers, describes the underlying pedagogical theories, knowledge translation frameworks, and research evidence used to derive the PEAK program - an educational program designed to promote the use of research evidence to inform physical therapist practice. The four components of the program are described in detail. The companion paper reports the results of a mixed methods feasibility analysis of this complex educational intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinicians need innovative educational programs to enhance their capacity for using research evidence to inform clinical decision-making. This paper and its companion paper introduce the Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (PEAK) program, an educational program designed to promote physical therapists' integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making. This, second of two, papers reports a mixed methods feasibility study of the PEAK program among physical therapists at three university-based clinical facilities.; METHODS: A convenience sample of 18 physical therapists participated in the six-month educational program. Mixed methods were used to triangulate results from pre-post quantitative data analyzed concurrently with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Feasibility of the program was assessed by evaluating change in participants' attitudes, self-efficacy, knowledge, skills, and self-reported behaviors in addition to their perceptions and reaction to the program.; RESULTS: All 18 therapists completed the program. The group experienced statistically significant improvements in evidence based practice self-efficacy and self-reported behavior (p<0.001). Four themes were supported by integrated quantitative and qualitative results: 1. The collaborative nature of the PEAK program was engaging and motivating; 2. PEAK participants experienced improved self-efficacy, creating a positive cycle where success reinforces engagement with research evidence; 3. Participants' need to understand how to interpret statistics was not fully met; 4. Participants believed that the utilization of research evidence in their clinical practice would lead to better patient outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: The PEAK program is a feasible educational program for promoting physical therapists' use of research evidence in practice. A key ingredient seems to be guided small group work leading to a final product that guides local practice. Further investigation is recommended to assess long-term behavior change and to compare outcomes to alternative educational models.

AB A 14-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency presented three times to a medical facility over a period of 4 months with fever and headache that progressed to hydrocephalus and status epilepticus necessitating a medically induced coma. Diagnostic workup including brain biopsy was unrevealing. Unbiased next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid identified 475 of 3,063,784 sequence reads (0.016%) corresponding to leptospira infection. Clinical assays for leptospirosis were negative. Targeted antimicrobial agents were administered, and the patient was discharged home 32 days later with a status close to his premorbid condition. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and serologic testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) subsequently confirmed evidence of Leptospira santarosai infection.

AB As more research studies incorporate next-generation sequencing (including whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing), investigators and institutional review boards face difficult questions regarding which genomic results to return to research participants and how. An American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 2013 policy paper suggesting that pathogenic mutations in 56 specified genes should be returned in the clinical setting has raised the question of whether comparable recommendations should be considered in research settings. The Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) Consortium and the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network are multisite research programs that aim to develop practical strategies for addressing questions concerning the return of results in genomic research. CSER and eMERGE committees have identified areas of consensus regarding the return of genomic results to research participants. In most circumstances, if results meet an actionability threshold for return and the research participant has consented to return, genomic results, along with referral for appropriate clinical follow-up, should be offered to participants. However, participants have a right to decline the receipt of genomic results, even when doing so might be viewed as a threat to the participants' health. Research investigators should be prepared to return research results and incidental findings discovered in the course of their research and meeting an actionability threshold, but they have no ethical obligation to actively search for such results. These positions are consistent with the recognition that clinical research is distinct from medical care in both its aims and its guiding moral principles.

AB We developed a systematic algorithmic solution for quantitative drug sensitivity scoring (DSS), based on continuous modeling and integration of multiple dose-response relationships in high-throughput compound testing studies. Mathematical model estimation and continuous interpolation makes the scoring approach robust against sources of technical variability and widely applicable to various experimental settings, both in cancer cell line models and primary patient-derived cells. Here, we demonstrate its improved performance over other response parameters especially in a leukemia patient case study, where differential DSS between patient and control cells enabled identification of both cancer-selective drugs and drug-sensitive patient sub-groups, as well as dynamic monitoring of the response patterns and oncogenic driver signals during cancer progression and relapse in individual patient cells ex vivo. An open-source and easily extendable implementation of the DSS calculation is made freely available to support its tailored application to translating drug sensitivity testing results into clinically actionable treatment options.

AB INTRODUCTION: The MRE11A-RAD50-Nibrin (MRN) complex plays several critical roles related to repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Inherited mutations in the three components predispose to genetic instability disorders and the MRN genes have been implicated in breast cancer susceptibility, but the underlying data are not entirely convincing. Here, we address two related questions: (1) are some rare MRN variants intermediate-risk breast cancer susceptibility alleles, and if so (2) do the MRN genes follow a BRCA1/BRCA2 pattern wherein most susceptibility alleles are protein-truncating variants, or do they follow an ATM/CHEK2 pattern wherein half or more of the susceptibility alleles are missense substitutions?; METHODS: Using high-resolution melt curve analysis followed by Sanger sequencing, we mutation screened the coding exons and proximal splice junction regions of the MRN genes in 1,313 early-onset breast cancer cases and 1,123 population controls. Rare variants in the three genes were pooled using bioinformatics methods similar to those previously applied to ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and CHEK2, and then assessed by logistic regression.; RESULTS: Re-analysis of our ATM, BRCA1, and BRCA2 mutation screening data revealed that these genes do not harbor pathogenic alleles (other than modest-risk SNPs) with minor allele frequencies>0.1% in Caucasian Americans, African Americans, or East Asians. Limiting our MRN analyses to variants with allele frequencies of <0.1% and combining protein-truncating variants, likely spliceogenic variants, and key functional domain rare missense substitutions, we found significant evidence that the MRN genes are indeed intermediate-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes (odds ratio (OR)=2.88, P=0.0090). Key domain missense substitutions were more frequent than the truncating variants (24 versus 12 observations) and conferred a slightly higher OR (3.07 versus 2.61) with a lower P value (0.029 versus 0.14).; CONCLUSIONS: These data establish that MRE11A, RAD50, and NBN are intermediate-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes. Like ATM and CHEK2, their spectrum of pathogenic variants includes a relatively high proportion of missense substitutions. However, the data neither establish whether variants in each of the three genes are best evaluated under the same analysis model nor achieve clinically actionable classification of individual variants observed in this study.

AB BACKGROUND: Hospital mortality is increasingly being regarded as a key indicator of patient safety, yet methodologies for assessing mortality are frequently contested and seldom point directly to areas of risk and solutions. The aim of our study was to classify reports of deaths due to unsafe care into broad areas of systemic failure capable of being addressed by stronger policies, procedures, and practices. The deaths were reported to a patient safety incident reporting system after mandatory reporting of such incidents was introduced.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: The UK National Health Service database was searched for incidents resulting in a reported death of an adult over the period of the study. The study population comprised 2,010 incidents involving patients aged 16 y and over in acute hospital settings. Each incident report was reviewed by two of the authors, and, by scrutinising the structured information together with the free text, a main reason for the harm was identified and recorded as one of 18 incident types. These incident types were then aggregated into six areas of apparent systemic failure: mismanagement of deterioration (35%), failure of prevention (26%), deficient checking and oversight (11%), dysfunctional patient flow (10%), equipment-related errors (6%), and other (12%). The most common incident types were failure to act on or recognise deterioration (23%), inpatient falls (10%), healthcare-associated infections (10%), unexpected per-operative death (6%), and poor or inadequate handover (5%). Analysis of these 2,010 fatal incidents reveals patterns of issues that point to actionable areas for improvement.; CONCLUSIONS: Our approach demonstrates the potential utility of patient safety incident reports in identifying areas of service failure and highlights opportunities for corrective action to save lives.

AB Heparan sulfate (HS) is a biopolymer consisting of variably sulfated repeating disaccharide units. The anticoagulant heparin is a highly sulfated intracellular variant of HS. HS has demonstrated roles in embryonic development, homeostasis, and human disease via non-covalent interactions with numerous cellular proteins, including growth factors and their receptors. HS can function as a co-receptor by enhancing receptor-complex formation. In other contexts, HS disrupts signaling complexes or serves as a ligand sink. The effects of HS on growth factor signaling are tightly regulated by the actions of sulfyltransferases, sulfatases, and heparanases. HS has important emerging roles in oncogenesis, and heparin derivatives represent potential therapeutic strategies for human cancers. Here we review recent insights into HS signaling in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and differentiation. A cancer-specific understanding of HS signaling could uncover potential therapeutic targets in this highly actionable signaling network.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ubiquity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) is creating new sources for healthcare information, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical drugs. We aimed to examine the impact of a given OSN's characteristics on the content of pharmaceutical drug discussions from that OSN. We compared the effect of four distinguishing characteristics from ten different OSNs on the content of their pharmaceutical drug discussions: (1) General versus Health OSN; (2) OSN moderation; (3) OSN registration requirements; and (4) OSNs with a question and answer format. The effects of these characteristics were measured both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that an OSN's characteristics indeed affect the content of its discussions. Based on their information needs, healthcare providers may use our findings to pick the right OSNs or to advise patients regarding their needs. Our results may also guide the creation of new and more effective domain-specific health OSNs. Further, future researchers of online healthcare content in OSNs may find our results informative while choosing OSNs as data sources. We reported several findings about the impact of OSN characteristics on the content of pharmaceutical drug discussion, and synthesized these findings into actionable items for both healthcare providers and future researchers of healthcare discussions on OSNs. Future research on the impact of OSN characteristics could include user demographics, quality and safety of information, and efficacy of OSN usage.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the implications of sequencing information and stated preferences for return of results among research participants.; METHODS: Six focus groups were held with 39 ClinSeq participants. The groups included participants who had received results, those who had not, those affected with cardiovascular disease, and healthy adults. Audio recordings of the sessions were transcribed and coded and analyzed for themes.; RESULTS: All participants expressed interest in receiving results that are medically actionable, nonactionable, carrier, and less so variants that cannot be interpreted. Most participants preferred to receive results in person, although several endorsed use of Internet-based resources that they could return to. Participants identified benefits for health management along with satisfying curiosity, making scientific contributions, and partnering in research. Value was seen in gaining control over health risks. Concerns were distress and/or fear that may result. Some participants were opposed to or ambivalent about learning certain types of results, particularly those having to do with diseases that were incurable or that might have implications for the health of their children.; CONCLUSION: There was relative enthusiasm about the value of learning sequencing information, yet it was tempered by concern about negative feeling responses and aversion to learning about incurable conditions.

AB The ACR formed the Actionable Reporting Work Group to address the potential role of IT in the communication of imaging findings, especially in cases that require nonroutine communication because of the urgency of the findings or their unexpected nature. These findings that require special communication with referring clinicians are classified as "actionable findings." The work group defines 3 categories of actionable findings that require, respectively, communication and clinical decision within minutes (category 1), hours (category 2), or days (category 3). Although the work group does not believe that there can be definitive lists of such findings, it developed lists in each category that would apply in most general hospital settings. For each category, the work group discusses ways in which IT can assist interpreting radiologists in successfully communicating to the relevant clinicians to ensure optimal patient care. IT systems can also help document the communication and facilitate auditing of the documentation. The work group recommends that vendors develop platforms that can be customized on the basis of local preferences and needs. Whatever system is used, it should be highly reliable and fit seamlessly into radiologists' workflow.  Copyright © 2014 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Oncogenic genetic alterations "drive" neoplastic cell proliferation. Small molecule inhibitors and antibodies are being developed that target an increasing number of these altered gene products. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool to identify tumor-specific genetic changes. To determine the clinical impact of extensive genetic analysis, we reviewed our experience using a targeted NGS platform (FoundationOne) in advanced cancer patients.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed demographics, NGS results, and therapies received for patients undergoing targeted NGS (exonic sequencing of 236 genes and selective intronic sequencing from 19 genes) between April 2012 and August 2013. Coprimary endpoints were the percentage of patients with targeted therapy options uncovered by mutational profiling and the percentage who received genotype-directed therapy.; RESULTS: Samples from 103 patients were tested, most frequently breast carcinoma (26%), head and neck cancers (23%), and melanoma (10%). Most patients (83%) were found to harbor potentially actionable genetic alterations, involving cell-cycle regulation (44%), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT (31%), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (19%) pathways. With median follow-up of 4.1 months, 21% received genotype-directed treatments, most in clinical trials (61%), leading to significant benefit in several cases. The most common reasons for not receiving genotype-directed therapy were selection of standard therapy (35%) and clinical deterioration (13%).; CONCLUSION: Mutational profiling using a targeted NGS panel identified potentially actionable alterations in a majority of advanced cancer patients. The assay identified additional therapeutic options and facilitated clinical trial enrollment. As time progresses, NGS results will be used to guide therapy in an increasing proportion of patients. ©AlphaMed Press.

AB OBJECTIVE: A substantial gap exists between patients and their mental health providers about patient's perceived barriers, facilitators, and motivators (BFMs) for taking antipsychotic medications. This article describes how we used an intervention mapping (IM) framework coupled with qualitative and quantitative item-selection methods to develop an intervention to bridge this gap with the goal of improving antipsychotic medication adherence.; METHODS: IM is a stepwise method for developing and implementing health interventions. A previous study conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and identified 477 BFMs associated with antipsychotic medication adherence. This article reports the results of using a variety of qualitative and quantitative item reduction and intervention development methods to transform the qualitative BFM data into a viable checklist and intervention.; RESULTS: The final BFM checklist included 76 items (28 barriers, 30 facilitators, and 18 motivators). An electronic and hard copy of the adherence progress note included a summary of current adherence, top three patient-identified barriers and top three facilitators and motivators, clarifying questions, and actionable adherence tips to address barriers during a typical clinical encounter.; DISCUSSION: The IM approach supplemented with qualitative and quantitative methods provided a useful framework for developing a practical and potentially sustainable antipsychotic medication adherence intervention. A similar approach to intervention development may be useful in other clinical situations where a substantial gap exists between patients and providers regarding medication adherence or other health behaviors. © 2013 Society for Public Health Education.

AB BACKGROUND: Family health history (FHH) is an underutilized tool in primary care to identify and risk-stratify individuals with increased cancer risk.; OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the influence of patient education on quantity and quality of FHH entered into a primary care-based software program, and impact on the program's cancer risk management recommendations.; DESIGN: Two primary care practices within a larger type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness controlled clinical trial.; PARTICIPANTS: English speaking non-adopted patients with a well visit appointment December 2012-March 2013.; INTERVENTIONS: One to two weeks prior to their well visit appointment, participants entered their FHH into the program. PARTICIPANTS were then provided educational materials describing key FHH components. They were instructed to use the interval to collect additional FHH information. Patients then returned for their scheduled appointment, and updated their FHH with any new information.; MAIN MEASURES: Percentage per pedigree of relatives meeting individual quality criteria. Changes made after patient education and changes to recommendations for surveillance, chemoprevention or genetic counseling referral.; KEY RESULTS: Post patient education, pedigrees exhibited a greater percentage (per pedigree) of: deceased relatives with age at death (84 vs. 81 % p = 0.02), deceased relatives with cause of death (91 vs. 87 % p = 0.02), relatives with a named health condition (45 vs. 42 % p = 0.002), and a greater percentage of relatives with high quality records (91 vs. 89 % p = 0.02). Of 43 participants with pedigree changes that could trigger changes in risk stratified prevention recommendations, 12 participants (28 %) received such changes.; CONCLUSIONS: Patient education improves FHH collection and subsequent risk stratification utilized in providing actionable evidence-based care recommendations for cancer risk management.

AB Pharmacogenomically relevant markers of drug response and adverse drug reactions are known to vary in frequency across populations. We examined minor allele frequencies (MAFs), genetic diversity (FST) and population structure of 1156 genetic variants (including 42 clinically actionable variants) in 212 genes involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in 19 populations (n=1478). There was wide population differentiation in these ADME variants, reflected in the range of mean MAF (DeltaMAF) and FST. The largest mean DeltaMAF was observed in African ancestry populations (0.10) and the smallest mean DeltaMAF in East Asian ancestry populations (0.04). MAFs ranged widely, for example, from 0.93 for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9923231, which influences warfarin dosing to 0.01 for SNP rs3918290 associated with capecitabine metabolism. ADME genetic variants show marked variation between and within continental groupings of populations. Enlarging the scope of pharmacogenomics research to include multiple global populations can improve the evidence base for clinical translation to benefit all peoples.

AB INTRODUCTION: Large-scale whole genome and exome resequencing studies have revealed that humans have a high level of deleterious rare variation, which has important implications for the design of future pharmacogenetics studies.; AREAS COVERED: Current pharmacogenetic guidelines focus on the implementation of common variation into dosing guidelines. However, it is becoming apparent that rare variation may also play an important role in differential drug response. Current sequencing technologies offer the opportunity to examine rare variation, but there are many challenges associated with such analyses. Nonetheless, if a comprehensive picture of the role that genetic variants play in treatment outcomes is to be obtained, it will be necessary to include the entire spectrum of variation, including rare variants, into pharmacogenetic research.; EXPERT OPINION: In order to implement pharmacogenetics in the clinic, patients should be genotyped for clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variants and patients responding unfavourably to treatment after pharmacogenetics-based dosing should be identified and resequenced to identify additional functionally relevant variants, including rare variants. All derived information should be added to a central database to allow for the updating of existing dosing guidelines. By routinely implementing such strategies, pharmacogenetics-based treatment guidelines will continue to improve.

AB While human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive squamous and adenosquamous carcinomas of the oropharynx have been well characterized, HPV-associated pure adenocarcinomas are exceptionally rare. Herein we report the clinicopathologic features of one such HPV-associated adenocarcinoma of the base of tongue (BOT). A 70year-old male presented with a 2.8cm base of tongue mass and lymphadenopathy. Immunohistochemically, the adenocarcinoma was p63 negative and p16 positive. HPV positivity was shown by in situ hybridization. Features of salivary type tumor or metastasis from a distant primary were absent. IonTorrent semiconductor sequencing analysis for 739 cancer-associated mutations in 46 actionable cancer genes was performed and PIK3CA exon 9 (p.E545K) and MET exon 2 (p.E168D) mutations were identified. No PIK3CA or MET amplification was identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A re-review of archival HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (n=89, 1983-2013) showed no additional cases of adenocarcinoma. The clinical follow-up for the three previously reported cases of HPV-associated adenocarcinoma of the BOT was updated. All previously reported cases were tested and were negative for PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 and MET exon 2 mutations. These findings offer a molecular basis for potential therapeutic use of PIK3CA inhibitors in a subset of patients with HPV-associated adenocarcinoma of BOT.

AB PURPOSE: For patients with a high likelihood of having metastatic disease (high-risk prostate cancer), bone scan is the standard, guideline-recommended test to look for bony metastasis. We quantified the use of bone scans and downstream procedures, along with associated costs, in patients with high-risk prostate cancer, and their use in low- and intermediate-risk patients for whom these tests are not recommended.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 were included. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and clinical T stage were used to define D'Amico risk categories. We report use of bone scans from the date of diagnosis to the earlier of treatment or 6 months. In patients who underwent bone scans, we report use of bone-specific x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and bone biopsy within 3 months after bone scan. Costs were estimated using 2012 Medicare reimbursement rates.; RESULTS: In all, 31% and 48% of patients with apparent low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent a bone scan; of these patients, 21% underwent subsequent x-rays, 7% CT, and 3% MRI scans. Bone biopsies were uncommon. Overall, <1% of low- and intermediate-risk patients were found to have metastatic disease. The annual estimated Medicare cost for bone scans and downstream procedures was $11,300,000 for low- and intermediate-risk patients. For patients with apparent high-risk disease, only 62% received a bone scan, of whom 14% were found to have metastasis.; CONCLUSIONS: There is overuse of bone scans in patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers, which is unlikely to yield clinically actionable information and results in a potential Medicare waste. However, there is underuse of bone scans in high-risk patients for whom metastasis is likely. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB INTRODUCTION: We describe clinical, pathologic, and molecular characteristics of never-smoker patients with small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs).; METHODS: We identified cases of SCLCs evaluated at our institution from 2005 to 2012. We collected smoking history, demographic, treatment, and survival data. EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, ALK testing, RB protein expression, and next generation sequencing were performed on available samples.; RESULTS: Two percent (23 of 1040) of patients with SCLCs were never-smokers. Eighty-three percent (19 of 23) had de novo SCLCs, whereas 17% had SCLC transformation as acquired resistance to erlotinib after treatment for EGFR-mutant lung carcinomas. Median survival from SCLC diagnosis was 23 months. Of de novo SCLCs, ALK rearrangement, KRAS mutations, EGFR mutations, and RB loss were identified in zero of five, zero of eight, two of eight, and six of seven, respectively. Two de novo samples underwent next generation sequencing. One had mutations in p53 and RB1 with amplification in TERT, and a second had mutations in CBL and GNAS with amplification in MYCL1.; CONCLUSIONS: Two percent of patients with SCLCs are never-smokers. Although transformation to SCLC can rarely occur in acquired resistance to erlotinib, 83% of never-smokers with SCLCs had de novo SCLC. RB loss was noted in 86% of cases. Multiplexed genotyping can be performed on tissues to identify potentially actionable oncogenic drivers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite numerous benefits of consuming a healthy diet and receiving regular physical activity, engagement in these behaviors is suboptimal. Since primary care visits are influential in promoting healthy behaviors, we sought to describe whether and how diet and physical activity are discussed during older adults' primary care visits.; METHODS: 115 adults aged 65 and older consented to have their routine primary care visits recorded. Audio-recorded visits were transcribed and diet and physical activity content was coded and analyzed.; RESULTS: Diet and physical activity were discussed in the majority of visits. When these discussions occurred, they lasted an average of a minute and a half. Encouragement and broad discussion of benefits of improved diet and physical activity levels were the common type of exchange. Discussions rarely involved patient behavioral self-assessments, patient questions, or providers' recommendations.; CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patient visits include discussion of diet and physical activity, but these discussions are often brief and rarely include recommendations.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Providers may want to consider ways to expand their lifestyle behavior discussions to increase patient involvement and provide more detailed, actionable recommendations for behavior change. Additionally, given time constraints, a wider array of approaches to lifestyle counseling may be necessary. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: The wide use of abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (APCT) in emergency departments (ED) has raised the concern for radiation exposure, costs and potential reactions to contrast agents. The aim of this study was to determine the yield and predictive factors for clinically actionable findings (CAF) in APCTs performed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who visit the ED.; METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including patients with IBD who visited the ED. Variables considered were demographics, IBD phenotype, clinical symptoms, IBD medication use prior to ED visit, laboratory values, and imaging results. The primary outcome was a composite of CAF, defined as new, intra-abdominal abscess or tumor, bowel obstruction, fistulae, diverticulitis, choledocholithiasis, or appendicitis.; RESULTS: 354 patients were included. One or more CAF were reported in 26.6% of the APCTs (32.1% in CD and 12.8% in UC [p<0.01]). Independent predictive variables of CAF in CD were: CRP level ≥5mg/dl (p=0.04), previous history of IBD surgery (p=0.037), Black race (p<0.01) and low body mass index (p<0.01). None of the study variables predicted CAF in UC.; CONCLUSIONS: The yield for CAF with APCT in the ED was high for CD patients but minimal for those with UC and was not improved by the use of contrast. Elevated CRP, low BMI, Black race and previous history of IBD surgery predicted CAF in CD but no variables were predictive of CAF in UC. Copyright © 2013 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

AB Protein levels and function are poorly predicted by genomic and transcriptomic analysis of patient tumours. Therefore, direct study of the functional proteome has the potential to provide a wealth of information that complements and extends genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects. Here we use reverse-phase protein arrays to analyse 3,467 patient samples from 11 TCGA 'Pan-Cancer' diseases, using 181 high-quality antibodies that target 128 total proteins and 53 post-translationally modified proteins. The resultant proteomic data are integrated with genomic and transcriptomic analyses of the same samples to identify commonalities, differences, emergent pathways and network biology within and across tumour lineages. In addition, tissue-specific signals are reduced computationally to enhance biomarker and target discovery spanning multiple tumour lineages. This integrative analysis, with an emphasis on pathways and potentially actionable proteins, provides a framework for determining the prognostic, predictive and therapeutic relevance of the functional proteome.

AB In contemporary oncology practices there is an increasing emphasis on concurrent evaluation of multiple genomic alterations within the biological pathways driving tumorigenesis. At the foundation of this paradigm shift are several commercially available tumor panels using next-generation sequencing to develop a more complete molecular blueprint of the tumor. Ideally, these would be used to identify clinically actionable variants that can be matched with available molecularly targeted therapy, regardless of the tumor site or histology. Currently, there is little information available on the post-analytic processes unique to next-generation sequencing platforms used by the companies offering these tests. Additionally, evidence of clinical validity showing an association between the genetic markers curated in these tests with treatment response to approved molecularly targeted therapies is lacking across all solid-tumor types. To date, there is no published data of improved outcomes when using the commercially available tests to guide treatment decisions. The uniqueness of these tests from other genomic applications used to guide clinical treatment decisions lie in the sequencing platforms used to generate large amounts of genomic data, which have their own related issues regarding analytic and clinical validity, necessary precursors to the evaluation of clinical utility. The generation and interpretation of these data will require new evidentiary standards for establishing not only clinical utility, but also analytical and clinical validity for this emerging paradigm in oncology practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Personalized cancer treatment relies on the accurate detection of actionable genomic aberrations in tumor cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) could provide an alternative genetic resource for diagnosis; however, the technical difficulties in isolating and analyzing rare CTCs have limited progress to date. In this preclinical study, we aimed to develop an improved capture system for molecular characterization of CTCs based on a novel cell sorting technology.; METHODS: We developed a cell capture platform using On-chip Sort (On-Chip Biotechnologies), a novel bench-top cell sorter equipped with a disposable microfluidic chip. Spike-in experiments comprising a series of lung cancer cell lines with varying epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression levels were conducted to assess the capture and purification efficiency of the platform. Samples were negatively enriched using anti-CD45-coated magnetic beads to remove white blood cells, followed by sample fixation and labeling. The enriched and labeled samples were then sorted by On-chip Sort based on cytokeratin, vimentin, and CD45 expression. Captured cells were immediately subjected to whole genome amplification followed by mutation analysis using deep targeted sequencing, and copy number analysis using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).; RESULTS: Spike-in experiments revealed an excellent overall mean capture rate of 70.9%. A 100% success rate in the detection of EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutations from captured cells was achieved using pyrosequencing and deep sequencing. The mutant variant detection rates were markedly higher than those obtained with the CellSearch profile kit. qPCR analysis of amplified DNA demonstrated reproducible detection of copy number changes of the EGFR in captured tumor cells.; CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel cell sorter, we established an efficient and convenient platform for the capture of CTCs. Results of a proof-of-principle preclinical study indicated that this platform has potential for the molecular characterization of captured CTCs from patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Family violence is a significant and complex public health problem that demands collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and policymakers for systemic, sustainable solutions. An integrated knowledge translation network was developed to support joint research production and application in the area. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the international Preventing Violence Across the Lifespan (PreVAiL) Research Network built effective partnerships among its members, with a focus on the knowledge user partner perspective.; METHODS: This mixed-methods study employed a combination of questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to understand partnerships two years after PreVAiL's inception. The questionnaire examined communication, collaborative research, dissemination of research, research findings, negotiation, partnership enhancement, information needs, rapport, and commitment. The interviews elicited feedback about partners' experiences with being part of the network.; RESULTS: Five main findings were highlighted: i) knowledge user partner involvement varied across activities, ranging from 11% to 79% participation rates; ii) partners and researchers generally converged on their assessment of communication indicators; iii) partners valued the network at both an individual level and to fulfill their organizations' mandates; iv) being part of PreVAiL allowed partners to readily contact researchers, and partners felt comfortable acting as an intermediary between PreVAiL and the rest of their own organization; v) application of research was just emerging; partners needed more actionable insights to determine ways to move forward given the research at that point in time.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the importance of developing and nurturing strong partnerships for integrated knowledge translation. Our findings are applicable to other network-oriented partnerships where a diversity of stakeholders work to address complex, multi-faceted public health problems.

AB IMPORTANCE: Targeting oncogenic drivers (genomic alterations critical to cancer development and maintenance) has transformed the care of patients with lung adenocarcinomas. The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium was formed to perform multiplexed assays testing adenocarcinomas of the lung for drivers in 10 genes to enable clinicians to select targeted treatments and enroll patients into clinical trials.; OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinomas and to use the data to select treatments targeting the identified driver(s) and measure survival.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From 2009 through 2012, 14 sites in the United States enrolled patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas and a performance status of 0 through 2 and tested their tumors for 10 drivers. Information was collected on patients, therapies, and survival.; INTERVENTIONS: Tumors were tested for 10 oncogenic drivers, and results were used to select matched targeted therapies.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Determination of the frequency of oncogenic drivers, the proportion of patients treated with genotype-directed therapy, and survival.; RESULTS: From 2009 through 2012, tumors from 1007 patients were tested for at least 1 gene and 733 for 10 genes (patients with full genotyping). An oncogenic driver was found in 466 of 733 patients (64%). Among these 733 tumors, 182 tumors (25%) had the KRAS driver; sensitizing EGFR, 122 (17%); ALK rearrangements, 57 (8%); other EGFR, 29 (4%); 2 or more genes, 24 (3%); ERBB2 (formerly HER2), 19 (3%); BRAF, 16 (2%); PIK3CA, 6 (<1%); MET amplification, 5 (<1%); NRAS, 5 (<1%); MEK1, 1 (<1%); AKT1, 0. Results were used to select a targeted therapy or trial in 275 of 1007 patients (28%). The median survival was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.96-7.70) for the 260 patients with an oncogenic driver and genotype-directed therapy compared with 2.4 years (IQR,0.88-6.20) for the 318 patients with any oncogenic driver(s) who did not receive genotype-directed therapy (propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.9], P=.006).; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Actionable drivers were detected in 64% of lung adenocarcinomas. Multiplexed testing aided physicians in selecting therapies. Although individuals with drivers receiving a matched targeted agent lived longer, randomized trials are required to determine if targeting therapy based on oncogenic drivers improves survival.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01014286.

AB One-hundred-fifty-three biliary cancers, including 70 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC), 57 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ECC) and 26 gallbladder carcinomas (GBC) were assessed for mutations in 56 genes using multigene next-generation sequencing. Expression of EGFR and mTOR pathway genes was investigated by immunohistochemistry. At least one mutated gene was observed in 118/153 (77%) cancers. The genes most frequently involved were KRAS (28%), TP53 (18%), ARID1A (12%), IDH1/2 (9%), PBRM1 (9%), BAP1 (7%), and PIK3CA (7%). IDH1/2 (p=0.0005) and BAP1 (p=0.0097) mutations were characteristic of ICC, while KRAS (p=0.0019) and TP53 (p=0.0019) were more frequent in ECC and GBC. Multivariate analysis identified tumour stage and TP53 mutations as independent predictors of survival. Alterations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, BAP1, PBRM1, SMARCB1) were seen in 31% of cases. Potentially actionable mutations were seen in 104/153 (68%) cancers: i) KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations were found in 34% of cancers; ii) mTOR pathway activation was documented by immunohistochemistry in 51% of cases and by mutations in mTOR pathway genes in 19% of cancers; iii) TGF-SS/Smad signaling was altered in 10.5% cancers; iv) mutations in tyrosine kinase receptors were found in 9% cases. Our study identified molecular subgroups of cholangiocarcinomas that can be explored for specific drug targeting in clinical trials.

AB In this issue of Blood, Nelson et al describe a novel somatic ARAF mutation in a child with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and demonstrate that the encoded protein has strong gain-of-function properties. Importantly, this mutant A-Raf molecule is sensitive to inhibition by vemurafenib, a potent and selective Raf kinase inhibitor that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma. This work thus identifies a new driver mutation in LCH that is potentially actionable in the clinic.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical specimens undergoing diagnostic molecular pathology testing are fixed in formalin due to the necessity for detailed morphological assessment. However, formalin fixation can cause major issues with molecular testing, as it causes DNA damage such as fragmentation and non-reproducible sequencing artefacts after PCR amplification. In the context of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), distinguishing true low frequency variants from sequencing artefacts remains challenging. The prevalence of formalin-induced DNA damage and its impact on molecular testing and clinical genomics remains poorly understood.; METHODS: The Cancer 2015 study is a population-based cancer cohort used to assess the feasibility of mutational screening using MPS in cancer patients from Victoria, Australia. While blocks were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded in different anatomical pathology laboratories, they were centrally extracted for DNA utilising the same protocol, and run through the same MPS platform (Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel). The sequencing artefacts in the 1-10% and the 10-25% allele frequency ranges were assessed in 488 formalin-fixed tumours from the pilot phase of the Cancer 2015 cohort. All blocks were less than 2.5 years of age (mean 93 days).; RESULTS: Consistent with the signature of DNA damage due to formalin fixation, many formalin-fixed samples displayed disproportionate levels of C>T/G>A changes in the 1-10% allele frequency range. Artefacts were less apparent in the 10-25% allele frequency range. Significantly, changes were inversely correlated with coverage indicating high levels of sequencing artefacts were associated with samples with low amounts of available amplifiable template due to fragmentation. The degree of fragmentation and sequencing artefacts differed between blocks sourced from different anatomical pathology laboratories. In a limited validation of potentially actionable low frequency mutations, a NRAS G12D mutation in a melanoma was shown to be a false positive.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DNA damage following formalin fixation remains a major challenge in laboratories working with MPS. Methodologies that assess, minimise or remove formalin-induced DNA damaged templates as part of MPS protocols will aid in the interpretation of genomic results leading to better patient outcomes.

AB We believe that no matter where a practice currently is in the EMR process--vetting products or companies to determine what will best meet its needs, implementing the new product just selected, or trying to take maximum advantage of the product already in use--we hope these suggestions, based on our experience, will contribute to your anticipated success. It is not uncommon for practices to become overwhelmed in the choice, implementation, and utilization of their EMR. What distinguishes those practices that are successful in their use of the EMR is their commitment to the product and their recognition that it is the central element in the treatment of their patients. Consistently exploring better ways to use OncoEMR, staying educated about the changes that occur, and taking full advantage of its best features will keep it simple and actionable for your practice.

AB IMPORTANCE: The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multicomponent study designed to generate actionable recommendations to reduce Army suicides and increase knowledge of risk and resilience factors for suicidality.; OBJECTIVES: To present data on prevalence, trends, and basic sociodemographic and Army experience correlates of suicides and accident deaths among active duty Regular Army soldiers between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, and thereby establish a foundation for future Army STARRS investigations.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of trends and predictors of suicide and accident deaths using Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems. Participants were all members of the US Regular Army serving at any time between 2004 and 2009.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death by suicide or accident during active Army service.; RESULTS: The suicide rate rose between 2004 and 2009 among never deployed and currently and previously deployed Regular Army soldiers. The accident death rate fell sharply among currently deployed soldiers, remained constant among the previously deployed, and trended upward among the never deployed. Increased suicide risk was associated with being a man (or a woman during deployment), white race/ethnicity, junior enlisted rank, recent demotion, and current or previous deployment. Sociodemographic and Army experience predictors were generally similar for suicides and accident deaths. Time trends in these predictors and in the Army's increased use of accession waivers (which relaxed some qualifications for new soldiers) do not explain the rise in Army suicides.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Predictors of Army suicides were largely similar to those reported elsewhere for civilians, although some predictors distinct to Army service emerged that deserve more in-depth analysis. The existence of a time trend in suicide risk among never-deployed soldiers argues indirectly against the view that exposure to combat-related trauma is the exclusive cause of the increase in Army suicides.

AB Professionalism is an indispensable element in the compact between the medical profession and society that is based on trust and putting the needs of patients above all other considerations. The resurgence of interest in professionalism dates back to the 1980s when health maintenance organizations were formed and proprietary influences in health care increased. Since then, a rich and comprehensive literature has emerged in defining professionalism, including desirable individual attributes and behaviors and how they may be taught, promoted, and assessed. More recently, scholarship has shifted from individual to organizational professionalism. This literature addresses the role that health care organizations can play to establish environments that are conducive to the consistent expression of professionalism by individuals and health care teams. We reviewed interdisciplinary empirical studies from health care effectiveness and outcomes, organizational sciences, positive psychology, and social psychology, finding evidence that organizational and individual professionalism is associated with a wide range of benefits to patients and the organization. We identify actionable organizational strategies and approaches that, if adopted, can foster and promote combined organizational and individual professionalism. In doing so, trust in the medical profession and its institutions can be enhanced, which in turn will reconfirm a commitment to the social compact.

AB False physiologic monitor alarms are extremely common in the hospital environment. High false alarm rates have the potential to lead to alarm fatigue, leading nurses to delay their responses to alarms, ignore alarms, or disable them entirely. Recent evidence from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The Joint Commission has demonstrated a link between alarm fatigue and patient deaths. Yet, very little scientific effort has focused on the rigorous quantitative measurement of alarms and responses in the hospital setting. We developed a system using multiple temporarily mounted, minimally obtrusive video cameras in hospitalized patients' rooms to characterize physiologic monitor alarms and nurse responses as a proxy for alarm fatigue. This allowed us to efficiently categorize each alarm's cause, technical validity, actionable characteristics, and determine the nurse's response time. We describe and illustrate the methods we used to acquire the video, synchronize and process the video, manage the large digital files, integrate the video with data from the physiologic monitor alarm network, archive the video to secure servers, and perform expert review and annotation using alarm "bookmarks." We discuss the technical and logistical challenges we encountered, including the root causes of hardware failures as well as issues with consent, confidentiality, protection of the video from litigation, and Hawthorne-like effects. The description of this video method may be useful to multidisciplinary teams interested in evaluating physiologic monitor alarms and alarm responses to better characterize alarm fatigue and other patient safety issues in clinical settings.

AB BACKGROUND: The premise that good governance will ultimately lead to better health outcomes has been central to the proliferation of work in this area over the past decade.; OBJECTIVE: To consolidate and align literature on governance by presenting an overview of efforts to define, describe and operationalize the health governance function.; METHODS: A targeted review of governance literature.; RESULTS: (1) A variety of terms have been assigned to precede health governance definitions. These terms commonly describe governance ideals (e.g. good, democratic) or characteristics of the organization of actors in governance arrangements (e.g. hierarchical, networked). (2) Dimensions of governance are defined from different perspectives and in varied combinations, capturing values, sub-functions and/or outcomes of governance. (3) Tools used to govern remain to be cataloged, however, measures can be aligned according to dimensions of governance or their ability to create specific relationships between actors.; DISCUSSION: Resolving the conceptual confusion around health governance requires recognition for the differences in the premise and approaches taken to defining governance, as well as specifying core dimensions and aligning applicable tools.; CONCLUSION: Despite a growing literature base, a concerted effort is needed for a more accessible understanding of health governance that is both practical at present and actionable for policy-makers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To articulate the concept of high-value care (i.e. clinically relevant, patient-important benefit at lowest possible cost) and suggest strategies by which clinicians can promote such care in rendering the Australian healthcare system more affordable and sustainable.; METHODS: Strategies were developed by the author based on personal experience in clinical practice, evidence-based medicine and quality improvement. Relevant literature was reviewed in retrieving studies supporting each strategy.; RESULTS: Ten strategies were developed: (1) minimise errors in diagnosis; (2) discontinue low- or no-value practices that provide little benefit or cause harm; (3) defer the use of unproven interventions; (4) select care options according to comparative cost-effectiveness; (5) target clinical interventions to those who derive greatest benefit; (6) adopt a more conservative approach nearing the end of life; (7) actively involve patients in shared decision making and self-management; (8) minimise day-to-day operational waste; (9) convert healthcare institutions into rapidly learning organisations; and (10) advocate for integrated patient care across all clinical settings.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and their professional organisations, in partnership with managers, can implement strategies capable of maximising value and sustainability of health care in Australia. What is known about this topic? Value-based care has emerged as a unitary concept that integrates quality and cost, and is being increasingly used to inform healthcare policy making and reform. What does this paper add? There is scant literature that translates the concept of high value care into actionable enhancement strategies for clinicians in everyday practice settings. This article provides 10 strategies with supporting studies in an attempt to fill this gap. What are the implications for practitioners? If all practitioners, in partnership with healthcare managers, attempted to enact all 10 strategies in their workplaces, a significant quantum of healthcare resources could be redirected from low- to high-value care, culminating in much greater health benefit from the healthcare dollars currently being spent. However, such reforms will require a shift in clinician thinking and practice away from volume-based care to value-based care.

AB Natural resource professionals in the United States recognize that climate-induced changes in phenology can substantially affect resource management. This is reflected in national climate change response plans recently released by major resource agencies. However, managers on-the-ground are often unclear about how to use phenological information to inform their management practices. Until recently, this was at least partially due to the lack of broad-based, standardized phenology data collection across taxa and geographic regions. Such efforts are now underway, albeit in very early stages. Nonetheless, a major hurdle still exists: phenology-linked climate change research has focused more on describing broad ecological changes rather than making direct connections to local to regional management concerns. To help researchers better design relevant research for use in conservation and management decision-making processes, we describe phenology-related research topics that facilitate "actionable" science. Examples include research on evolution and phenotypic plasticity related to vulnerability, the demographic consequences of trophic mismatch, the role of invasive species, and building robust ecological forecast models. Such efforts will increase phenology literacy among on-the-ground resource managers and provide information relevant for short- and long-term decision-making, particularly as related to climate response planning and implementing climate-informed monitoring in the context of adaptive management. In sum, we argue that phenological information is a crucial component of the resource management toolbox that facilitates identification and evaluation of strategies that will reduce the vulnerability of natural systems to climate change. Management-savvy researchers can play an important role in reaching this goal.

AB In spite of efforts to improve patient safety since the 1999 report, To Error Is Human, recent studies have shown limited progress toward preventing serious error. Most hospitals use root cause analysis as a method of serious event investigation. The authors postulate that this method suffers from 4 problems: (a) the use of root cause analysis is neither standardized nor reliable between organizations, (b) hospitals focus on "who" did "what" rather than on "why" the error occurred, (c) the identified causes are often too nonspecific to develop actionable correction plans, and (d) a standardized nomenclature does not exist to allow analysis of recurring errors across the organization. This article describes the modification of the Human Factors Analysis Classification System based on James Reason's theory of error causation for use in health care. This method resolves the 4 deficiencies noted above. The authors' experience investigating 105 serious events over 2 years is described.

AB There is growing interest in delivering genomically informed cancer therapy. Our aim was to determine the concordance of genomic alterations between primary and recurrent breast cancer. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, profiling 3,320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes often rearranged in cancer. Point mutations, indels, copy-number alterations (CNA), and select rearrangements were assessed in 74 tumors from 43 patients (36 primary and 38 recurrence/metastases). Alterations potentially targetable with established or investigational therapeutics were considered "actionable." Alterations were detected in 55 genes (mean 3.95 alterations/sample, range 1-12), including mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, AKT1, NF1, FBXW7, and FGFR3 and amplifications in MCL1, CCND1, FGFR1, MYC, IGF1R, MDM2, MDM4, AKT3, CDK4, and AKT2. In 33 matched primary and recurrent tumors, 97 of 112 (86.6%) somatic mutations were concordant. Of identified CNAs, 136 of 159 (85.5%) were concordant: 37 (23.3%) were concordant, but below the reporting threshold in one of the matched samples, and 23 (14.5%) discordant. There was an increased frequency of CDK4/MDM2 amplifications in recurrences, as well as gains and losses of other actionable alterations. Forty of 43 (93%) patients had actionable alterations that could inform targeted treatment options. In conclusion, deep genomic profiling of cancer-related genes reveals potentially actionable alterations in most patients with breast cancer. Overall there was high concordance between primary and recurrent tumors. Analysis of recurrent tumors before treatment may provide additional insights, as both gains and losses of targets are observed.

AB This article analyzes and theorizes the current knowledge silos at the intersection of omics science, ophthalmology, personalized medicine, and global visual health. Visual disorders represent one of the largest health care expenditures in the United States, costing $139 billion per year. In middle-income and industrialized countries, glaucoma is a World Health Organization priority category eye disease, known for difficulties in its early diagnosis, chronic progressive nature, and large person-to-person differences in drug efficacy and safety. A complex disease, glaucoma is best conceptualized as a syndrome displaying an ostensibly common clinical end-point, but with vastly heterogeneous molecular underpinnings and host-environment interactions. About 12% of all global blindness is attributable to glaucoma. Glaucomics is a term that we coin here so as to introduce omics science and systems diagnostics to ophthalmology, a field that can benefit enormously from personalized medicine, and which has sadly lagged behind in systems diagnostics compared to fields such as oncology. We define glaucomics as the integrated use of multi-omics and systems science approaches towards rational discovery, development, and tandem applications of diagnostics and therapeutics, for glaucoma specifically, and for personalized visual health, more broadly. We propose that glaucoma is one of the neglected lowest hanging fruits and actionable targets for omics and systems diagnostics in 21(st) century ophthalmology for the salient reasons we describe here. Additionally, we offer an analysis on two of the most pertinent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), trachoma and river blindness, which continue to plague visual health in developing countries. We conclude with a call for research on omics applications in glaucoma and personalized visual health.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in breast cancer that could be targeted with approved agents or investigational drugs in clinical trials using a next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling assay performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified and College of American Pathologists-accredited commercial laboratory. Methods. Fifty-one breast cancers were analyzed, including primary tumor biopsies of 33 stage I-II and 18 stage IV cancers (13 soft tissue, 3 liver, and 2 bone metastases). We assessed 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes often rearranged in cancer for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was 1,154*. Results. We observed 158 genomic alterations in 55 genes in 48 of 51 (94%) tumors (mean 3.1, range 0-9). The average number of potentially therapeutically relevant alterations was similar in primary (1.6, range 0-4) and in heavily pretreated metastatic cancers (2.0, range 0-4) (p = .24). The most common actionable alterations were in PIK3CA (n = 9, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K]/mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors), NF1 (n = 7, PI3K/mTOR/mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1-3 (n = 7, PI3K/mTOR/AKT inhibitors), BRCA1/2 (n = 6, poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors), and CCND1,2 and CCNE (n = 8)/cycline dependent kinase (CDK)6 (n = 1) (CDK4/6 inhibitors), KIT (n = 1, imatinib/sunitinib), ALK (n = 1, crizotinib), FGFR1,2 (n = 5, fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors), and EGFR (n = 2, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Our sequencing assay also correctly identified all six cases with HER2 (ERBB2) amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization when tumor content was adequate. In addition, two known activating HER2 mutations were identified, both in unamplified cases. Conclusion. Overall, 84% of cancers harbored at least one genomic alteration linked to potential treatment options. Systematic evaluation of the predictive value of these genomic alterations is critically important for further progress in this field.

AB Here, we use a large-scale cell line-based approach to identify cancer cell-specific mutations that are associated with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) dependence. For this purpose, we profiled the mutational landscape across 1,319 cancer-associated genes of 67 distinct cell lines and identified numerous genes involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PAXIP, and RAD50, as being associated with non-oncogene addiction to DNA-PKcs. Mutations in the mismatch repair gene MSH3, which have been reported to occur recurrently in numerous human cancer entities, emerged as the most significant predictors of DNA-PKcs addiction. Concordantly, DNA-PKcs inhibition robustly induced apoptosis in MSH3-mutant cell lines in vitro and displayed remarkable single-agent efficacy against MSH3-mutant tumors in vivo. Thus, we here identify a therapeutically actionable synthetic lethal interaction between MSH3 and the non-homologous end joining kinase DNA-PKcs. Our observations recommend DNA-PKcs inhibition as a therapeutic concept for the treatment of human cancers displaying homologous recombination defects.

AB Increased understanding of intertumoral heterogeneity at the genomic level has led to significant advancements in the treatment of solid tumors. Functional genomic alterations conferring sensitivity to targeted therapies can take many forms, and appropriate methods and tools are needed to detect these alterations. This review provides an update on genetic variability among solid tumors of similar histologic classification, using non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma as examples. We also discuss relevant technological platforms for discovery and diagnosis of clinically actionable variants and highlight the implications of specific genomic alterations for response to targeted therapy. ©2014 AACR.

AB BACKGROUND: Current technology permits an unbiased massive analysis of somatic genetic alterations from tumor DNA as well as the generation of individualized mouse xenografts (Avatar models). This work aimed to evaluate our experience integrating these two strategies to personalize the treatment of patients with cancer.; METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing analysis of 25 patients with advanced solid tumors to identify putatively actionable tumor-specific genomic alterations. Avatar models were used as an in vivo platform to test proposed treatment strategies.; RESULTS: Successful exome sequencing analyses have been obtained for 23 patients. Tumor-specific mutations and copy-number variations were identified. All samples profiled contained relevant genomic alterations. Tumor was implanted to create an Avatar model from 14 patients and 10 succeeded. Occasionally, actionable alterations such as mutations in NF1, PI3KA, and DDR2 failed to provide any benefit when a targeted drug was tested in the Avatar and, accordingly, treatment of the patients with these drugs was not effective. To date, 13 patients have received a personalized treatment and 6 achieved durable partial remissions. Prior testing of candidate treatments in Avatar models correlated with clinical response and helped to select empirical treatments in some patients with no actionable mutations.; CONCLUSION: The use of full genomic analysis for cancer care is encouraging but presents important challenges that will need to be solved for broad clinical application. Avatar models are a promising investigational platform for therapeutic decision making. While limitations still exist, this strategy should be further tested. ©2014 AACR.

AB Recently, the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) has been identified as the first actionable target in squamous cell lung cancer. Clinical trials testing specific FGFR inhibitors are in progress, and patients are selected based on their FGFR1 gene copy number status. Fluorescent in situ hybridization is the most commonly used method for detecting FGFR1 amplifications, but it has its limitations. In this paper, we describe a new non-fading and easy to assess assay for detecting FGFR1 amplification using a combination of chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization. We assessed 394 patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with the new assay and compared the results with those obtained by FGFR1 fluorescent in situ hybridization. We could assess copy number by the fluorescent in situ hybridization in 86.8 % (342/394) of cases, whereas with chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization, this was 79.4 % (313/394). By fluorescent in situ hybridization, a FGFR1 amplification was detected in 12.6 % (43/342) of cases, a low-level amplification (LLA) in 7.6 % (26/342) and a high-level amplification (HLA) in 5.0 % (17/342). By chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization, a FGFR1 amplification was found in 10.2 % (32/313) (5.7 % LLA, 4.5 % HLA). The two techniques showed highly concordant results (Pearson's correlation coefficient=0.971, p<0.01).

AB PURPOSE: Although predictive multiplex somatic genomic tests hold the potential to transform care by identifying targetable alterations in multiple cancer genes, little is known about how physicians will use such tests in practice.; PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Before the initiation of enterprise-wide multiplex testing at a major cancer center, we surveyed all clinically active adult cancer physicians to assess their current use of somatic testing, their attitudes about multiplex testing, and their genomic confidence.; RESULTS: A total of 160 physicians participated (response rate, 61%): 57% were medical oncologists; 29%, surgeons; 14% radiation oncologists; 37%, women; and 83%, research principal investigators. Twenty-two percent of physicians reported low confidence in their genomic knowledge. Eighteen percent of physicians anticipated testing patients infrequently (≤ 10%), whereas 25% anticipate testing most patients (≥ 90%). Higher genomic confidence was associated with wanting to test a majority of patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 6.09; 95% CI, 2.1 to 17.5) and anticipating using actionable (adjusted OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.2) or potentially actionable (adjusted OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.9) test results to inform treatment recommendations. Forty-two percent of physicians endorsed disclosure of uncertain genomic findings to patients.; CONCLUSION: Physicians at a tertiary-care National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center varied considerably in how they planned to incorporate predictive multiplex somatic genomic tests into practice and in their attitudes about the disclosure of genomic information of uncertain significance. Given that many physicians reported low genomic confidence, evidence-based guidelines and enhanced physician genomic education efforts may be needed to ensure that genomically guided cancer care is adequately delivered.

AB Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be divided into two different clinical entities based on their association with high-risk subtypes of human papilloma virus (HPV16 and HPV18). Dissimilarities in prognosis and molecular profiles have attracted much attention in recent years, in part because of increasing rates of HPV infection in HNSCC; however, the underlying mechanisms and detailed genetic profiles that set these tumors apart are still elusive. To elucidate oncogenic pathways in HNSCC with and without HPV infection, we used targeted next-generation sequencing to interrogate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 50 cancer-related genes. We detected SNPs in 25 of these genes from HNSCC tissue specimens with and without HPV infection. In 5 of the 25 genes, variant patterns were similar regardless of HPV infection status. A greater number of sequence variants in genes from the tyrosine kinase receptors and their associated pathways were preferentially present in HPV(+) specimens. SNPs in genes related to tumor-suppressor functions were more prevalent in HPV(-) HNSCC specimens. The observations may help to elucidate mechanisms involved in the molecular pathogenesis of two clinically diverse subclasses of HNSCC. Over-representation of SNPs in either HPV(+) or HPV(-) HNSCC is another indicator of potentially actionable sequence variants for targeted therapy.

AB The importance of health security in the United States has been highlighted by recent emergencies such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Superstorm Sandy, and the Boston Marathon bombing. The nation's health security remains a high priority today, with federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local governments, as well as nongovernment organizations and the private sector, engaging in activities that prevent, protect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from health threats. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR), led an effort to create an annual measure of health security preparedness at the national level. The collaborative released the National Health Security Preparedness Index (NHSPI()) in December 2013 and provided composite results for the 50 states and for the nation as a whole. The Index results represent current levels of health security preparedness in a consistent format and provide actionable information to drive decision making for continuous improvement of the nation's health security. The overall 2013 National Index result was 7.2 on the reported base-10 scale, with areas of greater strength in the domains of health surveillance, incident and information management, and countermeasure management. The strength of the Index relies on the interdependencies of the many elements in health security preparedness, making the sum greater than its parts. Moving forward, additional health security-related disciplines and measures will be included alongside continued validation efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: Somatic mutation analysis is standard of practice for solid tumors in order to identify therapeutic sensitizing and resistance mutations. Our laboratory routinely performed standalone PCR-based methods for mutations in several genes. Rapid discovery and introduction of new therapeutics has demanded additional genomic information for adequate management of the cancer patient. We evaluated a next generation sequencing assay, the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panelv2 (CHPv2), capable of identifying multiple somatic mutations in 50 genes in a single assay.; METHODS: Accuracy, precision, limit of detection, and specificity were evaluated using DNA from well-characterized cell lines, genetically engineered cell lines fixed and embedded in paraffin, and previously tested mutation positive or negative, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Normal kidney, tonsil and colon FFPE tissues were used as controls.; RESULTS: Accuracy studies showed 100% concordance in each patient sample between previous PCR results and the corresponding variants identified using the Ion Torrent panel. Precision studies gave consistent results when libraries were prepared from the same original DNA and were run on multiple 316 chips. The limit of detection was determined to be 5% for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 20% for insertions and deletions (indels). Specificity studies using normal FFPE tissue previously tested by PCR methods were also 100%.; CONCLUSIONS: We have evaluated the performance of the AmpliSeq Cancer Panel Hotspotv2 and show that it is suitable for clinical testing. This next generation sequencing panel has allowed the laboratory to consolidate a broader range of molecular oncology testing to a single platform and single assay.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Physician awareness of the results of tests pending at discharge (TPADs) is poor. We developed an automated system that notifies responsible physicians of TPAD results via secure, network email. We sought to evaluate the impact of this system on self-reported awareness of TPAD results by responsible physicians, a necessary intermediary step to improve management of TPAD results.; METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial at a major hospital affiliated with an integrated healthcare delivery network in Boston, Massachusetts. Adult patients with TPADs who were discharged from inpatient general medicine and cardiology services were assigned to the intervention or usual care arm if their inpatient attending physician and primary care physician (PCP) were both randomized to the same study arm. Patients of physicians randomized to discordant study arms were excluded. We surveyed these physicians 72 h after all TPAD results were finalized. The primary outcome was awareness of TPAD results by attending physicians. Secondary outcomes included awareness of TPAD results by PCPs, awareness of actionable TPAD results, and provider satisfaction.; RESULTS: We analyzed data on 441 patients. We sent 441 surveys to attending physicians and 353 surveys to PCPs and received 275 and 152 responses from 83 different attending physicians and 112 different PCPs, respectively (attending physician survey response rate of 63%). Intervention attending physicians and PCPs were significantly more aware of TPAD results (76% vs 38%, adjusted/clustered OR 6.30 (95% CI 3.02 to 13.16), p<0.001; 57% vs 33%, adjusted/clustered OR 3.08 (95% CI 1.43 to 6.66), p=0.004, respectively). Intervention attending physicians tended to be more aware of actionable TPAD results (59% vs 29%, adjusted/clustered OR 4.25 (0.65, 27.85), p=0.13). One hundred and eighteen (85%) and 43 (63%) intervention attending physician and PCP survey respondents, respectively, were satisfied with this intervention.; CONCLUSIONS: Automated email notification represents a promising strategy for managing TPAD results, potentially mitigating an unresolved patient safety concern.; CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01153451).

AB Precision medicine depends on the accurate identification of actionable mutations in a tumor sample. It is unknown how heterogeneous the distribution of such mutations can be in a tumor. Morphological (i.e. histopathological) heterogeneity is well described in lung adenocarcinoma and has been specifically recognized in the most recent official clinico-pathological classification. The most predominant subtype present is now used to classify each lung adenocarcinoma. No molecular profile exists to explain the intratumoral differences in lung adenocarcinoma morphology, despite the consistently observed association between specific predominant subtypes and poorer survival. Given a recent proposal stratifying lung adenocarcinoma into subtypes of differing metastatic potential, we questioned the assumption that major mutations are present uniformly throughout tumors; especially those showing discrete different subtypes. We selected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded lung adenocarcinoma specimens that showed discrete areas of different subtypes, extracted subtype DNA samples from those areas and screened for mutations in hotspot regions of the EGFR, KRAS and BRAF genes using high resolution melting. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm all identified mutations. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was used to identify mutant allele specific imbalances in tumors with EGFR mutations. Interestingly, we found that KRAS and BRAF mutations could be confined to morphological domains of higher grade. On the other hand, EGFR mutations were found through all histological subtypes in each tumor consistent with the driver status of this mutation. Intratumoral heterogeneity has major implications for tumorigenesis, chemoresistance and the role of histopathology in molecular screening for precision medicine. This study not only confirms that intratumoral mutational heterogeneity does occur, but also that it is associated with morphologically distinct regions in some tumors. From a practical perspective, small biopsies may not adequately represent a tumor's full mutational profile, particularly for later arising but prognostically important mutations such as those in the KRAS and BRAF genes.

AB Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is very common worldwide and can cause significant health problems from periodic skin and corneal lesions to encephalitis. Appearance of drug-resistant viruses in clinical therapy has made exploring novel antiviral agents emergent. Here we show that chloride channel inhibitors, including tamoxifen and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenyl-propylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB), exhibited extensive antiviral activities toward HSV-1 and ACV-resistant HSV viruses. HSV-1 infection induced chloride ion influx while treatment with inhibitors reduced the increase of intracellular chloride ion concentration. Pretreatment or treatment of inhibitors at different time points during HSV-1 infection all suppressed viral RNA synthesis, protein expression and virus production. More detailed studies demonstrated that tamoxifen and NPPB acted as potent inhibitors of HSV-1 early entry step by preventing viral binding, penetration and nuclear translocation. Specifically the compounds appeared to affect viral fusion process by inhibiting virus binding to lipid rafts and interrupting calcium homeostasis. Taken together, the observation that tamoxifen and NPPB can block viral entry suggests a stronger potential for these compounds as well as other ion channel inhibitors in antiviral therapy against HSV-1, especially the compound tamoxifen is an immediately actionable drug that can be reused for treatment of HSV-1 infections.

AB PURPOSE: Tailoring cancer treatment to tumor molecular characteristics promises to make personalized medicine a reality. However, reliable genetic profiling of archived clinical specimens has been hindered by limited sensitivity and high false-positive rates. Here, we describe a novel methodology, MMP-seq, which enables sensitive and specific high-throughput, high-content genetic profiling in archived clinical samples.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first validated the technical performance of MMP-seq in 66 cancer cell lines and a Latin square cross-dilution of known somatic mutations. We next characterized the performance of MMP-seq in 17 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical samples using matched fresh-frozen tissue from the same tumors as benchmarks. To demonstrate the potential clinical utility of our methodology, we profiled FFPE tumor samples from 73 patients with endometrial cancer.; RESULTS: We demonstrated that MMP-seq enabled rapid and simultaneous profiling of a panel of 88 cancer genes in 48 samples, and detected variants at frequencies as low as 0.4%. We identified DNA degradation and deamination as the main error sources and developed practical and robust strategies for mitigating these issues, and dramatically reduced the false-positive rate. Applying MMP-seq to a cohort of endometrial tumor samples identified extensive, potentially actionable alterations in the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and RAS pathways, including novel PIK3R1 hotspot mutations that may disrupt negative regulation of PIK3CA.; CONCLUSIONS: MMP-seq provides a robust solution for comprehensive, reliable, and high-throughput genetic profiling of clinical tumor samples, paving the way for the incorporation of genomic-based testing into clinical investigation and practice. ©2014 AACR.

AB We present advancements in microfluidic technology for rapid detection of as few as 10 rickettsial organisms in complex biological samples. An immuno-reactive filter, macroporous polyacrylamide monolith (PAM), fabricated within a microfluidic channel enhances solid-phase immuno-capture, staining and detection of targeted bacteria. Bacterial cells in samples flowing through the channel are forced to interact with the PAM filter surface due to size exclusion, overcoming common transport and kinetic limitations for rapid (min), high-efficiency (~100%) capture. In the process, targeted cells in sample volumes of 10 mul to >100 mul are concentrated within a sub-50 nl region at the PAM filter edge in the microchannel, thus concentrating them over 1000-fold. This significantly increases sensitivity, as the hydrophilic PAM also yields low non-specific immuno-fluorescence backgrounds with samples including serum, blood and non-targeted bacteria. The concentrated target cells are detected using fluorescently-labeled antibodies. With a single 2.0*2.0*0.3 mm PAM filter, as few as 10 rickettsial organisms per 100 l of lysed blood sample can be analyzed within 60 min, as compared to hours or even days needed for conventional detection methods. This method is highly relevant to rapid, multiplexed, low-cost point of care diagnostics at early stages of infection where diagnostics providing more immediate and actionable test results are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate potential natural and non-natural outbreaks or epidemics of rickettsial diseases. © 2013 The Authors.

AB The study of genetic influences on drug response and efficacy ('pharmacogenetics') has existed for over 50 years. Yet, we still lack a complete picture of how genetic variation, both common and rare, affects each individual's responses to medications. Exome sequencing is a promising alternative method for pharmacogenetic discovery as it provides information on both common and rare variation in large numbers of individuals. Using exome data from 2203 AA and 4300 Caucasian individuals through the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, we conducted a survey of coding variation within 12 Cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes that are collectively responsible for catalyzing nearly 75% of all known Phase I drug oxidation reactions. In addition to identifying many polymorphisms with known pharmacogenetic effects, we discovered over 730 novel nonsynonymous alleles across the 12 CYP genes of interest. These alleles include many with diverse functional effects such as premature stop codons, aberrant splicesites and mutations at conserved active site residues. Our analysis considering both novel, predicted functional alleles as well as known, actionable CYP alleles reveals that rare, deleterious variation contributes markedly to the overall burden of pharmacogenetic alleles within the populations considered, and that the contribution of rare variation to this burden is over three times greater in AA individuals as compared with Caucasians. While most of these impactful alleles are individually rare, 7.6-11.7% of individuals interrogated in the study carry at least one newly described potentially deleterious alleles in a major drug-metabolizing CYP.

AB BACKGROUND: While unannounced standardized patients (USPs) have been used to assess physicians' clinical skills in the ambulatory setting, they can also provide valuable information on patients' experience of the health care setting beyond the physician encounter. This paper explores the use of USPs as a methodology for evaluating patient-centered care in the health care system.; METHODS: USPs were trained to complete a behaviorally-anchored assessment of core dimensions of patient-centered care delivered within the clinical microsystem, including: 1) Medical assistants' safe practices, quality of care, and responsiveness to patients; 2) ease of clinic navigation; and 3) the patient-centeredness of care provided by the physician. Descriptive data is provided on these three levels of patient-centeredness within the targeted clinical microsystem. Chi-square analyses were used to signal whether variations by teams within the clinical microsystem were likely to be due to chance or might reflect true differences in patient-centeredness of specific teams.; RESULTS: Sixty USP visits to 11 Primary Care teams were performed over an eight-month period (mean 5 visits/team; range 2-8). No medical assistants reported detecting an USP during the study period. USPs found the clinic easy to navigate and that teams were functioning well in 60% of visits. In 30% to 47% of visits, the physicians could have been more patient-centered. Medical assistants' patient safety measures were poor: patient identity was confirmed in only 5% of visits and no USPs observed medical assistants wash their hands. Quality of care was relatively high for vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, weight and height), but low for depression screening, occurring in only 15% of visits. In most visits, medical assistants greeted the patient in a timely fashion but took time to fully explain matters in less than half of the visits and rarely introduced themselves. Physicians tried to help patients navigate the system in 62% of visits.; CONCLUSIONS: USP assessment captured actionable, critical, behaviorally-specific information on team and system performance in an urban community clinic. This methodology provides unique insight into the patient-centeredness and quality of care in medical settings.

AB INTRODUCTION: We summarize the development, definitive trials, and practical use of enzalutamide for practicing urologists and medical oncologists. The care paradigm for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a changing landscape, with the ongoing discovery of drivers of cancer progression yielding actionable targets for drug development. Since 2010, sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, abiraterone with prednisone, radium 223 and enzalutamide have been Food and Drug Administration approved based upon improvement in overall survival in men with mCRPC.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE search for "enzalutamide or MDV3100" yielded 258 results. Prospective trials were reviewed. Abstracts from ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) meetings and press release information were included where applicable.; RESULTS: Enzalutamide, an oral inhibitor of the androgen receptor pathway, was approved in 2012 based upon improvement in overall survival of 4.8 months in men with mCRPC following docetaxel versus placebo. Measures of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and radiographic response, and clinically significant endpoints such as quality of life improvement and toxicity parameters favored enzalutamide. Toxicity is modest with asthenia and fatigue being most common, with a 1% incidence of seizure reported, though patients can be selected to decrease this risk.; CONCLUSION: Enzalutamide is an effective oral therapy for mCRPC, with an overall survival benefit before and following chemotherapy. Toxicity is mild, and seizure risk can be mitigated by careful patient selection. Ongoing studies will help determine the best sequence of novel agents for prostate cancer, along with safe and effective combinations of therapies. Better understanding of tumor characteristics, particularly reliance on the androgen receptor pathway, will lead to personalized approaches to prostate cancer therapy.

AB Epidemiological projections of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the rapidly expanding population over the age of 65, and the enormous societal consequence on health, economics, and community foretell of a looming global public health crisis. Currently available treatments for AD are symptomatic, with modest effect sizes and limited impact on longer term disease outcomes. There have been no newly approved pharmaceutical treatments in the last decade, despite enormous efforts to develop disease-modifying treatments directed at Alzheimer's-associated pathology. An unprecedented collaborative effort of government, regulators, industry, academia, and the community at-large is needed to address this crisis and to develop an actionable plan for rapid progress toward successfully developing effective treatments. Here, we map out a course of action in four key priority areas, including (1) addressing the fundamental mechanisms of disease, with the goal of developing a core set of research tools, a framework for data sharing, and creation of accessible validated and replicated disease models; (2) developing translational research that emphasizes rapid progress in disease model development and better translation from preclinical to clinical stages, deploying leading technologies to more accurately develop predictive models; (3) preventing AD through the development of robust methods and resources to advance trials and creating fundamental resources such as continuous adaptive trials, registries, data repositories, and instrument development; and (4) innovating public/private partnerships and global collaborations, with mechanisms to incentivize collaborations and investments, develop larger precompetitive spaces, and more rapid data sharing.  © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB Integration of conservation partnerships across geographic, biological, and administrative boundaries is increasingly relevant because drivers of change, such as climate shifts, transcend these boundaries. We explored successes and challenges of established conservation programs that span multiple watersheds and consider both social and ecological concerns. We asked representatives from a diverse set of 11 broad-extent conservation partnerships in 29 countries 17 questions that pertained to launching and maintaining partnerships for broad-extent conservation, specifying ultimate management objectives, and implementation and learning. Partnerships invested more funds in implementing conservation actions than any other aspect of conservation, and a program's context (geographic extent, United States vs. other countries, developed vs. developing nation) appeared to substantially affect program approach. Despite early successes of these organizations and benefits of broad-extent conservation, specific challenges related to uncertainties in scaling up information and to coordination in the face of diverse partner governance structures, conflicting objectives, and vast uncertainties regarding future system dynamics hindered long-term success, as demonstrated by the focal organizations. Engaging stakeholders, developing conservation measures, and implementing adaptive management were dominant challenges. To inform future research on broad-extent conservation, we considered several challenges when we developed detailed questions, such as what qualities of broad-extent partnerships ensure they complement, integrate, and strengthen, rather than replace, local conservation efforts and which adaptive management processes yield actionable conservation strategies that account explicitly for dynamics and uncertainties regarding multiscale governance, environmental conditions, and knowledge of the system? © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB The usual remedy suggested for bridging the science-to-practice gap is to improve the efficiency of disseminating the evidence-based practices to practitioners. This reflection on the gap takes the position that it is the relevance and fit of the evidence with the majority of practices that limit its applicability and application in health promotion and related behavioural, community and population-level interventions where variations in context, values and norms make uniform interventions inappropriate. To make the evidence more relevant and actionable to practice settings and populations will require reforms at many points in the research-to-practice pipeline. These points in the pipeline are described and remedies for them suggested.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: Resuscitation measures should be guided by previous patient choices about end-of-life care, when they exist; however, documentation of these choices can be unclear or difficult to access. We evaluate the concordance of a statewide registry of actionable resuscitation orders unique to Oregon with out-of-hospital and emergency department (ED) care provided for patients found by emergency medical services (EMS) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.; METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients found by EMS providers in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 5 counties in 2010. We used probabilistic linkage to match patients found in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with previously signed documentation of end-of-life decisions in the Oregon Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) registry. We evaluated resuscitation interventions in the field and ED.; RESULTS: There were 1,577 patients found in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, of whom 82 had a previously signed POLST form. Patients with POLST do-not-resuscitate orders for whom EMS was called had resuscitation withheld or ceased before hospital admission in 94% of cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 83% to 99%). Compared with patients with no POLST or known do-not-resuscitate orders, more patients with attempt resuscitation POLST orders had field resuscitation attempted (84% versus 60%; difference 25%; 95% CI 12% to 37%) and were admitted to hospitals (38% versus 17%; difference 20%; 95% CI 3% to 37%), with no documented misinterpretations of the form once CPR was initiated.; CONCLUSION: In this sample of patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, out-of-hospital and ED care was generally concordant with previously documented end-of-life orders in the setting of critical illness. Further research is needed to compare the effectiveness of Oregon's POLST system to other methods of end-of-life order documentation. Copyright © 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians.

AB This third and final installment of this series on innovative designs for the smart ICU addresses the steps involved in conceptualizing, actualizing, using, and maintaining the advanced ICU informatics infrastructure and systems. The smart ICU comprehensively and electronically integrates the patient in the ICU with all aspects of care, displays data in a variety of formats, converts data to actionable information, uses data proactively to enhance patient safety, and monitors the ICU environment to facilitate patient care and ICU management. The keys to success in this complex informatics design process include an understanding of advanced informatics concepts, sophisticated planning, installation of a robust infrastructure capable of both connectivity and interoperability, and implementation of middleware solutions that provide value. Although new technologies commonly appear compelling, they are also complicated and challenging to incorporate within existing or evolving hospital informatics systems. Therefore, careful analysis, deliberate testing, and a phased approach to the implementation of innovative technologies are necessary to achieve the multilevel solutions of the smart ICU.

AB Since September 2010, more than 10,000 patients have undergone preemptive, panel-based pharmacogenomic testing through the Vanderbilt Pharmacogenomic Resource for Enhanced Decisions in Care and Treatment program. Analysis of the genetic data from the first 9,589 individuals reveals that the frequency of genetic variants is concordant with published allele frequencies. Based on five currently implemented drug-gene interactions, the multiplexed test identified one or more actionable variants in 91% of the genotyped patients and in 96% of African American patients. Using medication exposure data from electronic medical records, we compared a theoretical "reactive," prescription-triggered, serial single-gene testing strategy with our preemptive, multiplexed genotyping approach. Reactive genotyping would have generated 14,656 genetic tests. These data highlight three advantages of preemptive genotyping: (i) the vast majority of patients carry at least one pharmacogenetic variant; (ii) data are available at the point of care; and (iii) there is a substantial reduction in testing burden compared with a reactive strategy.

AB IMPORTANCE The mean cost of medical care in the United States is growing at an unsustainable rate; from 2003 through 2011, the cost for an emergency department (ED) visit rose 240%, from $560 to $1354. The diagnostic tests, treatments, and hospitalizations that emergency clinicians order result in significant costs. OBJECTIVE To create a "top-five" list of tests, treatments, and disposition decisions that are of little value, are amenable to standardization, and are actionable by emergency medicine clinicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Modified Delphi consensus process and survey of 283 emergency medicine clinicians (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) from 6 EDs. INTERVENTION We assembled a technical expert panel (TEP) and conducted a modified Delphi process to identify a top-five list using a 4-step process. In phase 1, we generated a list of low-value clinical decisions from TEP brainstorming and e-mail solicitation of clinicians. In phase 2, the TEP ranked items on contribution to cost, benefit to patients, and actionability by clinicians. In phase 3, we surveyed all ordering clinicians from the 6 EDs regarding distinct aspects of each item. In phase 4, the TEP voted for a final top-five list based on survey results and discussion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A top-five list for emergency medicine. The TEP ranked items on contribution to cost, benefit to patients, and actionability by clinicians. The survey asked clinicians to score items on the potential benefit or harm to patients and the provider actionability of each item. Voting and surveys used 5-point Likert scales. A Pearson interdomain correlation was used. RESULTS Phase 1 identified 64 low-value items. Phase 2 narrowed this list to 7 laboratory tests, 3 medications, 4 imaging studies, and 3 disposition decisions included in the phase 3 survey (71.0% response rate). All 17 items showed a significant positive correlation between benefit and actionability (r, 0.19-0.37 [P≤.01]). One item received unanimous TEP support, 4 received majority support, and 12 received at least 1 vote. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our TEP identified clinical actions that are of low value and within the control of ED health care providers. This method can be used to identify additional actionable targets of overuse in emergency medicine.

AB We report the design of a targeted resequencing panel for monogenic dyslipidemias, LipidSeq, for the purpose of replacing Sanger sequencing in the clinical detection of dyslipidemia-causing variants. We also evaluate the performance of the LipidSeq approach versus Sanger sequencing in 84 patients with a range of phenotypes including extreme blood lipid concentrations as well as additional dyslipidemias and related metabolic disorders. The panel performs well, with high concordance (95.2%) in samples with known mutations based on Sanger sequencing and a high detection rate (57.9%) of mutations likely to be causative for disease in samples not previously sequenced. Clinical implementation of LipidSeq has the potential to aid in the molecular diagnosis of patients with monogenic dyslipidemias with a high degree of speed and accuracy and at lower cost than either Sanger sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, LipidSeq will help to provide a more focused picture of monogenic and polygenic contributors that underlie dyslipidemia while excluding the discovery of incidental pathogenic clinically actionable variants in nonmetabolism-related genes, such as oncogenes, that would otherwise be identified by a whole exome approach, thus minimizing potential ethical issues.

AB Lung cancer in never-smokers was recognised as a distinct clinical entity around the mid-2000s because these patients tended to be Asian women and diagnosed at a younger age with a preponderance of adenocarcinoma and better survival outcome despite a more advanced stage of presentation. It was soon discovered that lung cancer in never-smokers had a higher prevalence of activating EGFR mutations and we tend to classify lung cancer by smoking status for screening purpose. With the discoveries of many actionable driver mutations such as activating EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement in adenocarcinoma of the lung we have switched to classifying non-small cell lung cancer into different individual molecular subgroups based on the presence of a dominant driver mutation. Although many actionable driver mutations are found in never-smokers with adenocarcinoma, this review will summarise that a substantial proportion of patients with these actionable driver mutations had a previous smoking history. Alternatively among the driver mutations that are associated with smoking history, a fair amount of these patients were never-smokers. Thus smoking status should not be used as a screen strategy for identifying driver mutations in clinical practice. Finally smoking history may have predictive and/or prognostic significance within individual molecular subgroups and identifying the difference according to smoking history may help optimise future targeted therapy.

AB PURPOSE: To assess the effects of a new computed tomographic (CT) temporal subtraction (TS) method on radiologist performance in lung nodule detection on thin-section CT images.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, and the informed consent requirement was waived. Fifty pairs (current and previous CT images) of standard-dose 2-mm thin-section CT images and corresponding CT TS images were used for an observer performance study. Two thoracic radiologists identified 30 nodules ranging in size from 5 to 19 mm, and these nodules served as the reference standard of actionable nodules (noncalcified nodules larger than 4 mm). Eight radiologists (four attending radiologists, four radiology residents) participated in this observer study. Ratings and locations of lesions determined by observers were used to assess the significance of differences between radiologists' performances without and with the CT TS images in jacknife free-response receiver operating characteristics analysis.; RESULTS: Average figure of merit values increased significantly for all radiologists (from 0.838 without CT TS images to 0.894 with CT TS images [P = .033]). Average sensitivity for detection of actionable nodules was improved from 73.4% to 83.4%, with a false-positive rate of 0.15 per case, by using CT TS images. The reading time with CT TS images was not significantly different from that without.; CONCLUSION: The novel CT TS method would increase observer performance for lung nodule detection without considerably extending the reading time.

AB Despite increased comprehension of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) pathogenesis, current treatment strategies have done little to improve upon standard induction chemotherapy to induce long-term remissions. Since the identification of the leukemic stem cell, efforts have been placed on identifying therapeutically actionable pathways that distinguish this increasingly important cellular compartment. With the advent of increased genome sequencing efforts and phenotypic characterization, opportunities for personalized treatment strategies are rapidly emerging. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the understanding of leukemic stem cell biology and their potential for translation into clinically relevant therapeutics.

AB Clinical cancer research today often includes testing the value of biomarkers to direct treatment and for drug development. However, the practical challenges of integration of molecular information into clinical trial protocols are increasingly appreciated. Inherent difficulties include evidence gaps in available biomarker data, a paucity of robust assay methods, and the design of appropriate studies within the constraints of feasible trial operations, and finite resources. Scalable and proportionate approaches are needed to systematically cope with these challenges. Therefore, we assembled international experts from three clinical trials organisations to identify the common challenges and common solutions. We present a practical risk-assessment framework allowing targeting of scarce resources to crucial issues coupled with a library of useful resources and a simple actionable checklist of recommendations. We hope that these practical methods will be useful for running biomarker-driven trials and ultimately help to develop biomarkers that are ready for integration in routine practice.

AB BACKGROUND: The current systems of healthcare delivery in the United States suffer from problems that often leave patients with inadequate quality of care. In their report entitled "Crossing the Quality Chasm," the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified reasons for poor and/or inconsistent quality of healthcare delivery and provided recommendations to improve it. The purpose of this review is to describe features of an innovative web-based program called the Thyroid Cancer Care Collaborative (TCCC) and see how it addresses IOM recommendations to improve the quality of healthcare delivery.; SUMMARY: The TCCC addresses the three actionable IOM recommendations directed at healthcare organizations and clinicians to redesign the care process. It does so by exploiting information technology (IT) in ways suggested by the IOM, and it fits within a set of 10 rules provided by the IOM. Some features of the TCCC include: (i) automated disease staging based on three validated scoring systems; (ii) highly illustrated educational videos on all aspects of thyroid cancer care; (iii) personalized clinical decision-making modules for clinicians and physicians; (iv) portability of data to share among treating physicians; (v) virtual tumor boards, "ask the expert," and frequently asked questions modules; (vi) physician workflow integration; and (vii) data for comprehensive analysis to answer difficult questions in thyroid cancer management.; CONCLUSION: The TCCC has the potential to improve thyroid cancer care delivery and offers several benefits to patients, clinicians, and researchers. The TCCC is a valuable example of how IOM initiatives can improve the healthcare system.

AB OBJECTIVES: It is now well established by many groups that surgery on the aortic arch may be achieved with consistently low morbidity and mortality along with relatively good survival compared to estimated natural history for a number of aortic arch pathologies. The objectives of this study were to: 1) report, compare, and analyze our morbidity and mortality outcomes for hemiarch and total aortic arch surgery; 2) examine the survival benefit of hemiarch and total aortic arch surgery compared to age- and sex-matched controls; and 3) define factors which influence survival in these two groups and, in particular, identify those that are modifiable and potentially actionable.; METHODS: Outcomes from patients undergoing surgical resection of both hemiarch and total aortic arch at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital between June 1999 and December 2012 were examined in a retrospective analysis of data collected for The Society for Cardiothoracic Surgeons (UK).; RESULTS: Over the period studied, a total of 1240 patients underwent aortic surgery, from which 287 were identified as having undergone hemi to total aortic arch surgery under deep or moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest. Twenty three percent of patients' surgeries were nonelective. The median age at the time of patients undergoing elective hemiarch was 64.3 years and total arch was 65.3 years (P = 0.25), with 40.1% being female in the entire group. A total of 140 patients underwent elective hemiarch replacement, while 81 underwent elective total arch replacement. Etiology of the aortic pathology was degenerative in 51.2% of the two groups, with 87.1% requiring aortic valve repair in the elective hemiarch group and 64.2% in the elective total arch group (P < 0.001). Elective in-hospital mortality was 2.1% in the hemiarch group and 6.2% (P = 0.15) in the total arch group with corresponding rates of stroke (2.9% versus 4.9%, P = 0.47), renal failure (4.3% versus 6.2%, P = 0.54), reexploration for bleeding (4.3% versus 4.9%, P > 0.99), and prolonged ventilation (8.6% versus 16.1%, P = 0.09). Overall mortality was 20.9% at 5 years, while it was 15.7% in the elective hemiarch and 25.9% in the total arch group (P = 0.065). Process control charts demonstrated stability of annualized mortality outcomes over the study period. Survival curve was flat and parallel compared to age- and sex-matched controls beyond 2 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the following independent factors associated with survival: renal dysfunction [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.44-6.73], New York Heart Association (NYHA) class ≥ III (HR = 2.25; 95% CI = 1.38-3.67), circulatory arrest time > 100 minutes (HR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.57-5.43), peripheral vascular disease (HR = 2.44; 95% CI = 1.25-4.74), and concomitant coronary artery bypass graft operation (HR = 2.14; 95% CI = 1.20-3.80).; CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity, mortality, and medium-term survival were not statistically different for patients undergoing elective hemi-aortic arch and total aortic arch surgery. The survival curve in this group of patients is flat and parallel to sex- and age-matched controls beyond 2 years. Multivariate analysis identified independent influences on survival as renal dysfunction, NYHA class ≥ III, circulatory arrest time (> 100 min), peripheral vascular disease, and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Focus on preoperative optimization of some of these variables may positively influence long-term survival.

AB Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Both histologically and molecularly lung cancer is heterogeneous. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the pathways involved in the various types of lung cancer with an emphasis on the clinical implications of the increasing number of actionable molecular targets. It describes the major pathways and molecular alterations implicated in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma and squamous cancer), and of small cell carcinoma, emphasizing the molecular alterations comprising the specific blueprints in each group. The approved and investigational targeted therapies as well as the immune therapies, and clinical trials exploring the variety of targeted approaches to treatment of lung cancer are the main focus of this review.

AB The yet-unrealized potential for more "personalized" Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) tests to fundamentally alter the practice and economics of healthcare is undeniable. However, there are also many challenges to be met, including the herculean task of ensuring that the information provided by such tests is scientifically sound and, ideally, medically actionable. We consider recent events in DTC testing and suggest a "thought experiment" of an approach that could ultimately meet the needs of patients, providers and regulatory authorities.

AB Although circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were first observed over a century ago, lack of sensitive methodology precluded detailed study of these cells until recently. However, technological advances have now facilitated the identification, enumeration, and characterization of CTCs using a variety of methods. The majority of evidence supporting the use of CTCs in clinical decision-making has been related to enumeration using the CellSearch system and correlation with prognosis. Growing evidence also suggests that CTC monitoring can provide an early indication of patient treatment response based on comparison of CTC levels before and after therapy. However, perhaps the greatest potential that CTCs hold for oncology lies at the level of molecular characterization. Clinical treatment decisions may be more effective if they are based on molecular characteristics of metastatic cells rather than on those of the primary tumor alone. Molecular characterization of CTCs (which can be repeatedly isolated in a minimally invasive fashion) provides the opportunity for a "real-time liquid biopsy" that allows assessment of genetic drift, investigation of molecular disease evolution, and identification of actionable genomic characteristics. This review focuses on recent advances in this area, including approaches involving immunophenotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex RT-PCR, microarray, and genomic sequencing.

AB IMPORTANCE: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly applied in clinical medicine and is expected to uncover clinically significant findings regardless of sequencing indication.; OBJECTIVES: To examine coverage and concordance of clinically relevant genetic variation provided by WGS technologies; to quantitate inherited disease risk and pharmacogenomic findings in WGS data and resources required for their discovery and interpretation; and to evaluate clinical action prompted by WGS findings.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An exploratory study of 12 adult participants recruited at Stanford University Medical Center who underwent WGS between November 2011 and March 2012. A multidisciplinary team reviewed all potentially reportable genetic findings. Five physicians proposed initial clinical follow-up based on the genetic findings.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genome coverage and sequencing platform concordance in different categories of genetic disease risk, person-hours spent curating candidate disease-risk variants, interpretation agreement between trained curators and disease genetics databases, burden of inherited disease risk and pharmacogenomic findings, and burden and interrater agreement of proposed clinical follow-up.; RESULTS: Depending on sequencing platform, 10% to 19% of inherited disease genes were not covered to accepted standards for single nucleotide variant discovery. Genotype concordance was high for previously described single nucleotide genetic variants (99%-100%) but low for small insertion/deletion variants (53%-59%). Curation of 90 to 127 genetic variants in each participant required a median of 54 minutes (range, 5-223 minutes) per genetic variant, resulted in moderate classification agreement between professionals (Gross kappa, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40-0.64), and reclassified 69% of genetic variants cataloged as disease causing in mutation databases to variants of uncertain or lesser significance. Two to 6 personal disease-risk findings were discovered in each participant, including 1 frameshift deletion in the BRCA1 gene implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Physician review of sequencing findings prompted consideration of a median of 1 to 3 initial diagnostic tests and referrals per participant, with fair interrater agreement about the suitability of WGS findings for clinical follow-up (Fleiss kappa, 0.24; P<001).; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this exploratory study of 12 volunteer adults, the use of WGS was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of detection of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable findings. In certain cases, WGS will identify clinically actionable genetic variants warranting early medical intervention. These issues should be considered when determining the role of WGS in clinical medicine.

AB The survival of patients with advanced osteosarcoma is poor with limited therapeutic options. There is an urgent need for new targeted therapies based on biomarkers. Recently, theranostic molecular profiling services for cancer patients by CLIA-certified commercial companies as well as in-house profiling in academic medical centers have expanded exponentially. We evaluated molecular profiles of patients with advanced osteosarcoma whose tumor tissue had been analyzed by one of the following methods: 1. 182-gene next-generation exome sequencing (Foundation Medicine, Boston, MA), 2. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)/PCR-based panel (CARIS Target Now, Irving, Tx), 3.Comparative genome hybridization (Oncopath, San Antonio, TX). 4. Single-gene PCR assays, PTEN IHC (MDACC CLIA), 5. UT Houston morphoproteomics (Houston, TX). The most common actionable aberrations occur in the PI3K/PTEN/mTOR pathway. No patterns in genomic alterations beyond the above are readily identifiable, and suggest both high molecular diversity in osteosarcoma and the need for more analyses to define distinct subgroups of osteosarcoma defined by genomic alterations. Based on our preliminary observations we hypothesize that the biology of aggressive and the metastatic phenotype osteosarcoma at the molecular level is similar to human fingerprints, in that no two tumors are identical. Further large scale analyses of osteosarcoma samples are warranted to test this hypothesis.

AB BACKGROUND: In the context of the massive scale up of malaria interventions, there is increasing recognition that the current capacity of routine malaria surveillance conducted in most African countries through integrated health management information systems is inadequate. The timeliness of reporting to higher levels of the health system through health management information systems is often too slow for rapid action on focal infectious diseases such as malaria. The purpose of this paper is to: 1) describe the implementation of a malaria sentinel surveillance system in Ethiopia to help fill this gap; 2) describe data use for epidemic detection and response as well as programmatic decision making; and 3) discuss lessons learned in the context of creating and running this system.; CASE DESCRIPTION: As part of a comprehensive strategy to monitor malaria trends in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia, a system of ten malaria sentinel sites was established to collect data on key malaria morbidity and mortality indicators. To ensure the sentinel surveillance system provides timely, actionable data, the sentinel facilities send aggregate data weekly through short message service (SMS) to a central database server. Bland-Altman plots and Poisson regression models were used to investigate concordance of malaria indicator reports and malaria trends over time, respectively.; DISCUSSION: This paper describes three implementation challenges that impacted system performance in terms of: 1) ensuring a timely and accurate data reporting process; 2) capturing complete and accurate patient-level data; and 3) expanding the usefulness and generalizability of the system's data to monitor progress towards the national malaria control goals of reducing malaria deaths and eventual elimination of transmission.; CONCLUSIONS: The use of SMS for reporting surveillance data was identified as a promising practice for accurately tracking malaria trends in Oromia. The rapid spread of this technology across Africa offers promising opportunities to collect and disseminate surveillance data in a timely way. High quality malaria surveillance in Ethiopia remains a resource intensive activity and extending the generalizability of sentinel surveillance findings to other contexts remains a major limitation of these strategies.

AB Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which show significant association at the well-known APOE locus and at nineteen additional loci. Among the functional, disease-associated variants at these loci, missense variants are particularly important because they can be readily investigated in model systems to search for novel therapeutic targets. It is now possible to perform a low-cost search for these "actionable" variants by genotyping the missense variants at known LOAD loci already cataloged on the Exome Variant Server (EVS). In this proof-of-principle study designed to explore the efficacy of this approach, we analyzed three rare EVS variants in APOE, p.L28P, p.R145C and p.V236E, in our case control series of 9114 subjects. p.R145C proved to be too rare to analyze effectively. The minor allele of p.L28P, which was in complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1) with the far more common APOE ϵ4 allele, showed no association with LOAD (P = 0.75) independent of the APOE ϵ4 allele. p.V236E was significantly associated with a marked reduction in risk of LOAD (P = 7.5 * 10⁻⁰⁵; OR = 0.10, 0.03 to 0.45). The minor allele of p.V236E, which was in complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1) with the common APOE ϵ3 allele, identifies a novel LOAD-associated haplotype (APOE ϵ3b) which is associated with decreased risk of LOAD independent of the more abundant APOE ϵ2, ϵ3 and ϵ4 haplotypes. Follow-up studies will be important to confirm the significance of this association and to better define its odds ratio. The ApoE p.V236E substitution is the first disease-associated change located in the lipid-binding, C-terminal domain of the protein. Thus our study (i) identifies a novel APOE missense variant which may profitably be studied to better understand how ApoE function may be modified to reduce risk of LOAD and (ii) indicates that analysis of protein-altering variants cataloged on the EVS can be a cost-effective way to identify actionable functional variants at recently discovered LOAD loci.

AB Data fully utilized by the community resources promote progress rather than repetition. Effective data sharing can accelerate the transition from data to actionable knowledge, yet barriers to data sharing remain, both technological and procedural. The DELSA community has tackled the sharing barrier by creating a multi-omics metadata checklist for the life sciences. The checklist and associated data publication examples are now jointly published in Big Data and OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology. The checklist will enable diverse datasets to be easily harmonized and reused for richer analyses. It will facilitate data deposits, stand alone as a data publication, and grant appropriate credit to researchers. We invite the broader life sciences community to test the checklist for feedback and improvements.

AB The National Human Genome Research Institute, in close collaboration with its research community, is pursuing an ambitious research agenda to facilitate and promote the implementation of genomics in clinical care. Since 2011, research programs utilizing next-generation sequencing in the management of cancer and other multigenic conditions, workup of undiagnosed conditions, and evaluation of disorders of the newborn period have been initiated, along with projects identifying clinically actionable variants and exploring the ethical and social implications of reporting these findings. Several genomic medicine symposia and other consultations have helped to shape these research initiatives and develop educational materials for physicians and others working to implement the use of genomic findings in clinical care. These efforts provide a valuable complement to the highly successful basic genomics research enterprise that has at last enabled the transition of genomics from the bench to the bedside. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Pharmacogenetics is frequently cited as an area for initial focus of the clinical implementation of genomics. Through the PG4KDS protocol, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital pre-emptively genotypes patients for 230 genes using the Affymetrix Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) Plus array supplemented with a CYP2D6 copy number assay. The PG4KDS protocol provides a rational, stepwise process for implementing gene/drug pairs, organizing data, and obtaining consent from patients and families. Through August 2013, 1,559 patients have been enrolled, and four gene tests have been released into the electronic health record (EHR) for clinical implementation: TPMT, CYP2D6, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C19. These genes are coupled to 12 high-risk drugs. Of the 1,016 patients with genotype test results available, 78% of them had at least one high-risk (i.e., actionable) genotype result placed in their EHR. Each diplotype result released to the EHR is coupled with an interpretive consult that is created in a concise, standardized format. To support-gene based prescribing at the point of care, 55 interruptive clinical decision support (CDS) alerts were developed. Patients are informed of their genotyping result and its relevance to their medication use through a letter. Key elements necessary for our successful implementation have included strong institutional support, a knowledgeable clinical laboratory, a process to manage any incidental findings, a strategy to educate clinicians and patients, a process to return results, and extensive use of informatics, especially CDS. Our approach to pre-emptive clinical pharmacogenetics has proven feasible, clinically useful, and scalable. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Current challenges exist to widespread clinical implementation of genomic medicine and pharmacogenetics. The University of Florida (UF) Health Personalized Medicine Program (PMP) is a pharmacist-led, multidisciplinary initiative created in 2011 within the UF Clinical Translational Science Institute. Initial efforts focused on pharmacogenetics, with long-term goals to include expansion to disease-risk prediction and disease stratification. Herein we describe the processes for development of the program, the challenges that were encountered and the clinical acceptance by clinicians of the genomic medicine implementation. The initial clinical implementation of the UF PMP began in June 2012 and targeted clopidogrel use and the CYP2C19 genotype in patients undergoing left heart catheterization and percutaneous-coronary intervention (PCI). After 1 year, 1,097 patients undergoing left heart catheterization were genotyped preemptively, and 291 of those underwent subsequent PCI. Genotype results were reported to the medical record for 100% of genotyped patients. Eighty patients who underwent PCI had an actionable genotype, with drug therapy changes implemented in 56 individuals. Average turnaround time from blood draw to genotype result entry in the medical record was 3.5 business days. Seven different third party payors, including Medicare, reimbursed for the test during the first month of billing, with an 85% reimbursement rate for outpatient claims that were submitted in the first month. These data highlight multiple levels of success in clinical implementation of genomic medicine. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Genome-wide association studies, DNA sequencing studies, and other genomic studies are finding an increasing number of genetic variants associated with clinical phenotypes that may be useful in developing diagnostic, preventive, and treatment strategies for individual patients. However, few variants have been integrated into routine clinical practice. The reasons for this are several, but two of the most significant are limited evidence about the clinical implications of the variants and a lack of a comprehensive knowledge base that captures genetic variants, their phenotypic associations, and other pertinent phenotypic information that is openly accessible to clinical groups attempting to interpret sequencing data. As the field of medicine begins to incorporate genome-scale analysis into clinical care, approaches need to be developed for collecting and characterizing data on the clinical implications of variants, developing consensus on their actionability, and making this information available for clinical use. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Wellcome Trust thus convened a workshop to consider the processes and resources needed to: (1) identify clinically valid genetic variants; (2) decide whether they are actionable and what the action should be; and (3) provide this information for clinical use. This commentary outlines the key discussion points and recommendations from the workshop. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB CONTEXT: Current clinicopathologic assessment of malignant neoplastic diseases entails the analysis of specific genetic alterations that provide diagnostic, prognostic, or therapy-determining information.; OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a robust molecular method to detect clinically relevant mutations in various tissue types and anatomic pathology specimens.; DESIGN: Genes of interest were amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and sequence variants identified by liquid bead array cytometry. The BRAF assay was fully characterized by using plasmids and genomic DNA extracted from cell lines, metastatic colorectal cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, and thyroid nodule fine-needle aspirates.; RESULTS: Qualitative multiplex assays for 22 different mutations in the BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, or EGFR genes were established. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the technology enabled reproducible detection of BRAF c.1799T>A (p.V600E) at 0.5% mutant allele in 20 ng of genomic DNA. Precision studies with multiple operators and instruments showed very high repeatability and reproducibility with 100% (98.7%-100%) qualitative agreement among 292 individual measures in 38 runs. Evaluation of 1549 representative pathologic specimens in 2 laboratories relative to independent reference methods resulted in 99.0% (97.6%-99.6%) agreement for colorectal FFPE tissues (n = 416) and 98.9% (98.2%-99.4%) for thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens (n = 1133) with an overall diagnostic odds ratio of 10856 (2451-48078).; CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex assay system is a sensitive and reliable method to detect BRAF c.1799T>A mutation in colorectal and thyroid lesions. This optimized technology platform is suitable for the rapid analysis of clinically actionable genetic alterations in cytologic and histologic specimens.

AB CONTEXT: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. Biomarker testing is critical to personalized therapy in lung adenocarcinoma and has been extensively investigated in non-Hispanic whites, Asians, and African Americans. However, little information addresses the underlying genetic changes in lung adenocarcinoma among Hispanic patients in the United States.; OBJECTIVE: To identify targetable biomarkers other than EGFR and EML4-ALK in Hispanic patients with lung adenocarcinoma.; DESIGN: We tested DNA extracted from 85 lung adenocarcinoma specimens collected from 40 Hispanic and 43 non-Hispanic white patients for previously reported mutations in KRAS, MET, BRAF, mTOR, STAT3, JAK2, PIK3CA, AKT1 through AKT3, and PTEN with a custom Sequenom massARRAY assay (Sequenom, San Diego, California).; RESULTS: Mutations in KRAS were identified in 11 cases (13%; 6 Hispanic [7%], 5 non-Hispanic white [6%]) and had no correlation with sex, age, or smoking history. Mutations in PIK3CA were identified in 2 of the 40 Hispanic patients (5%), including one patient (2.5%) with a concurrent KRAS mutation. The tumors were wild type for all other genes tested.; CONCLUSIONS: Targetable biomarkers other than EGFR and EML4-ALK were identified in 7 of the 40 Hispanic patients (18%) and 5 of the 43 non-Hispanic white patients (12%), suggesting a similar mutational frequency. Our highly multiplexed genotyping assay detected actionable mutations in 14% (12 of 83) more patients than would have been identified by EGFR and EML4-ALK testing alone.

AB PURPOSE: The characterization of actionable mutations in human tumors is a prerequisite for the development of individualized, targeted therapy. We examined the prevalence of potentially therapeutically actionable mutations in patients with high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-eight samples of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy tissue from a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial were analyzed. DNA extracted from microdissected tumor was analyzed for 643 common solid tumor mutations in 53 genes using mass spectroscopy-based sequencing. In addition, PTEN loss and erythroblast transformation-specific-related gene (ERC) translocations were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in associated tissue microarrays. Association with relapse during 5 years of follow-up was examined in exploratory analyses of the potential clinical relevance of the genetic alterations.; RESULTS: Of the 40 tumors evaluable for mutations, 10% had point mutations in potentially actionable cancer genes. Of the 47 tumors evaluable for IHC, 36% had PTEN loss and 40% had ERG rearrangement. Individual mutations were not frequent enough to determine associations with relapse. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test, the 16 patients who had PTEN loss had a significantly shorter median relapse-free survival, 19 versus 106 months (P = 0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that point mutations in the most common cancer regulatory genes in prostate cancer are rare. However, the PIK3CA/AKT pathway was mutated in 10% of our samples. Although point mutations alone did not have a statistically significant association with relapse, PTEN loss was associated with an increased relapse in high-risk prostate cancer treated with chemotherapy followed by surgery. ©2013 AACR

AB Individuals with disabilities are at a greater risk of experiencing healthcare disparities. To address these disparities, healthcare organizations (HCOs) need to consistently and accurately document patients' disability status. Unfortunately, the evidence base does not yet exist to guide HCOs in determining what data to collect or the best method to collect the data. The authors propose a research agenda for developing and administering disability status questions. To determine what data to collect, researchers need to addresses the following challenges: disability is a complex concept, a wide range of types of disabilities exists, severity levels of disability can differ and, finally, patients might use assistive devices or aids to mitigate or ameliorate their disability. Additionally, research is needed to determine the frequency with which to administer questions due to the dynamic nature of disability, and to develop protocols for assessing the most appropriate person to answer disability status questions. Targeted research will lead to disability status questions that accurately and consistently identify individuals with disabilities and produce actionable data that HCOs can use to detect and address potential disparities in care.  © 2013 National Association for Healthcare Quality.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize diabetes patient engagement and clinician notifications for an mHealth interactive voice response (IVR) service.; DESIGN: Observational study.; METHODS: For three to six months, VA patients with diabetes received weekly IVR calls assessing health status and self-care along with tailored education. Patients could enroll with an informal caregiver who received suggestions on self-management support. Notifications were issued to clinicians when patients reported significant problems.; RESULTS: Patients (n = 303) participated for a total of 5684 patient-weeks, during which 84% of calls were completed. The odds of call completion decreased over time (AOR = 0.96, p < 0.001), and were lower among unmarried patients (AOR = 0.67, p = 0.038) and those who had difficulties with health literacy (AOR = 0.67, p = 0.039), diabetes-related distress (AOR = 0.30, p = 0.018), or medication nonadherence (AOR = 0.57, p = 0.002). Twenty-one clinician notifications were triggered per 100 patient-weeks. The odds of notification were higher during the early weeks of the program (AOR = 0.95, p < 0.001) and among patients who were older (AOR = 1.03, p = 0.004) or more physically impaired (AOR = 0.97, p < 0.001).; CONCLUSIONS: By providing information that is reliable, valid, and actionable, IVR-based mHealth services may increase access to between-visit monitoring and diabetes self-management support. The system detects abnormal glycemia and blood pressure levels that might otherwise go unreported, although thresholds for clinician notifications might require adjustment to avoid overloading clinicians. Patient engagement might be enhanced by addressing health literacy and psychological distress. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To operate under a new value-based paradigm, oncology providers must develop the capability to aggregate, analyze, measure, and report their value proposition--that is, their outcomes and associated costs. How are oncology providers positioned currently to perform these functions in a manner that is actionable? What is the current state of analytic capabilities in oncology? Are oncology providers prepared? This line of inquiry was the basis for the 2013 Cancer Center Business Summit annual industry research survey. This article reports on the key findings and implications of the 2013 research survey with regard to data analytic capabilities in the oncology sector. The essential finding from the study is that only a small number of oncology providers (7%) currently possess the analytic tools and capabilities necessary to satisfy internal and external demands for aggregating and reporting clinical outcome and economic data. However there is an expectation that a majority of oncology providers (60%) will have developed such capabilities within the next 2 years.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical implications of KRAS mutational status in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. To clarify this point, we retrospectively explored whether KRAS mutations could impact tumor response, and disease control rate (DCR) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) as well as progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).; METHODS: Between June 2009 and June 2012, 340 patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were reviewed in a single institution (Institut Gustave Roussy). Two hundred and one patients had a biomolecular profile and received a platinum-based first-line CT. Patients with an unknown mutational status or with actionable alterations were excluded. We retained two groups: patients with KRAS mutated tumor (MUT) and patients with wild-type KRAS/EGFR (WT). Multivariate analyses with Cox model were used. Survival curves were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method.; RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients were included in the analysis: 39 in the MUT group and 69 in the WT group. Baseline radiological assessment demonstrated more brain (P=0.01) and liver (P=0.04) metastases in MUT patients. DCR was 76% for MUT vs. 91% for WT group (P=0.03), regardless of the type of platinum-based CT (use of pemetrexed or not). Although no statistically significant differences were found, shorter PFS (4.9 vs. 6.0 months; P=0.79) and OS (10.3 vs. 13.2 months; P=0.40) were observed for patients with KRAS mutated tumors in univariate analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutant tumors had a lower DCR after the first-line platinum-based CT, but this difference did not translate in PFS or OS. The presence of KRAS mutations may confer a more aggressive disease, with greater baseline incidence of hepatic and cerebral metastases. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) features as predictors of individual errors made by trainees when detecting masses in mammograms.; METHODS: Ten radiology trainees and three expert breast imagers reviewed 100 mammograms comprised of bilateral medial lateral oblique and craniocaudal views on a research workstation. The cases consisted of normal and biopsy proven benign and malignant masses. For cases with actionable abnormalities, the experts recorded breast (density and axillary lymph nodes) and mass (shape, margin, and density) features according to the BI-RADS lexicon, as well as the abnormality location (depth and clock face). For each trainee, a user-specific multivariate model was constructed to predict the trainee's likelihood of error based on BI-RADS features. The performance of the models was assessed using area under the receive operating characteristic curves (AUC).; RESULTS: Despite the variability in errors between different trainees, the individual models were able to predict the likelihood of error for the trainees with a mean AUC of 0.611 (range: 0.502-0.739, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.543-0.680,p < 0.002).; CONCLUSIONS: Patterns in detection errors for mammographic masses made by radiology trainees can be modeled using BI-RADS features. These findings may have potential implications for the development of future educational materials that are personalized to individual trainees.

AB BACKGROUND: Comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer that has metastasized to bone has proved challenging, which may limit the diagnostic and potential therapeutic opportunities for patients with bone-only metastatic disease.; METHODS: We describe successful tissue acquisition, DNA extraction, and whole-exome sequencing from a bone metastasis of a patient with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa).; RESULTS: The resulting high-quality tumor sequencing identified plausibly actionable somatic genomic alterations that dysregulate the phosphoinostide 3-kinase pathway, as well as a theoretically actionable germline variant in the BRCA2 gene.; CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility of diagnostic bone metastases profiling and analysis that will be required for the widespread application of prospective 'precision medicine' to men with advanced PCa.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improving actionable stroke knowledge of a witness or bystander, which in some cases are children, may improve response to an acute stroke event.; METHODS: We used a quasiexperimental pre-test post-test design to evaluate actionable stroke knowledge of 210 children aged 9 to 10 years in response to a single, 15-minute exposure to a stroke education video game conducted in the school computer laboratory. After immediate post-test, we provided remote password-protected online video game access and encouraged children to play at their leisure from home. An unannounced delayed post-test occurred 7 weeks later.; RESULTS: Two hundred ten children completed pretest, 205 completed immediate post-test, whereas 198 completed delayed post-test. One hundred fifty-six (74%) children had Internet access at home, and 41 (26%), mostly girls, played the video game remotely. There was significant improvement in stroke symptom composite scores, calling 911, and all individual stroke knowledge items, including a distractor across the testing sequence (P<0.05). Children who played the video game remotely demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of 1 symptom (sudden imbalance) compared with children who did not (P<0.05), although overall composite scores showed no difference.; CONCLUSIONS: Stroke education video games may represent novel means for improving and sustaining actionable stroke knowledge of children.

AB BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a subtype of primary liver cancer that is rarely curable by surgery and is rapidly increasing in incidence. Relapsed ICC has a poor prognosis, and current systemic nontargeted therapies are commonly extrapolated from those used in other gastrointestinal malignancies. We hypothesized that genomic profiling of clinical ICC samples would identify genomic alterations that are linked to targeted therapies and that could facilitate a personalized approach to therapy.; METHODS: DNA sequencing of hybridization-captured libraries was performed for 3,320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 36 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Sample DNA was isolated from 40 mum of 28 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ICC specimens and sequenced to high coverage.; RESULTS: The most commonly observed alterations were within ARID1A (36%), IDH1/2 (36%), and TP53 (36%) as well as amplification of MCL1 (21%). Twenty cases (71%) harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, including FGFR2 (14%), KRAS (11%), PTEN (11%), CDKN2A (7%), CDK6 (7%), ERBB3 (7%), MET (7%), NRAS (7%), BRCA1 (4%), BRCA2 (4%), NF1 (4%), PIK3CA (4%), PTCH1 (4%), and TSC1 (4%). Four (14%) of the ICC cases featured novel gene fusions involving the tyrosine kinases FGFR2 and NTRK1 (FGFR2-KIAA1598, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-TACC3, and RABGAP1L-NTRK1).; CONCLUSION: Two thirds of patients in this study harbored genomic alterations that are associated with targeted therapies and that have the potential to personalize therapy selection for to individual patients.

AB OBJECTIVES: Studies suggest that intraosseous (IO) access is underutilized in adult resuscitations, despite recommendations from advanced trauma and cardiac life support guidelines. The objective was to determine factors associated with IO access use by physicians during adult resuscitations when intravenous (IV) access is not immediately achievable.; METHODS: This study was an online survey among physicians purposefully recruited from various clinical care areas at three teaching hospitals. Questions were generated from the qualitative results of 20 iterative interviews, verified for internal validity, and piloted. The interview guide was based on the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which elicits salient attitudes, social influences, and control beliefs that potentially influence intention to use IO access. Recruitment took place in September 2012 until reaching more than 100% of the required sample size (n = 200). Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's alpha, and the effect of TPB constructs and specific beliefs were assessed with regression analyses.; RESULTS: For the 205 respondents, the mean age was 35 years (range = 20 to 66 years), and 53.3% were male. Participants' departmental affiliations were 50.3% emergency medicine (EM), 16.9% internal medicine, 14.9% anesthesia, 10.8% general surgery, and 7.2% critical care. Residents comprised 60.7% of the sample, and 39.3% were attending physicians. Median intention to use IO access when IV is not immediately achievable was 4.67 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4 to 5) out of 5 (5 highest) and predicted by the following TPB constructs: attitudes (AdjCoefficients = 0.504; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.334 to 0.673), social influences (AdjCoefficients = 0.285; 95% CI = 0.172 to 0.398), and control beliefs (AdjCoefficients 0.217; 95% CI = 0.113 to 0.320). Physicians were more likely to use IO access if they believed that it provided rapid vascular access for delivering large volumes of fluids, could prevent delays in care, and was associated with a low complication rate. Conversely, the perception that nurses are not familiar or supportive of IO access and a lack of physician confidence regarding the appropriate indications for IO access were barriers to use.; CONCLUSIONS: These data are an important step in the knowledge-to-action process, as they identify specific factors associated with physician use of IO access. Interventions addressing these actionable facilitators and barriers are likely to have a positive effect on increasing the appropriate physician use of this potentially life-saving technique in adult patients requiring emergent vascular access. © 2014 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

AB To most people, the log file would not be considered an exciting area in technology today. However, these relatively benign, slowly growing data sources can drive large business transformations when combined with modern-day analytics. Accenture Technology Labs has built a new framework that helps to expand existing vendor solutions to create new methods of gaining insights from these benevolent information springs. This framework provides a systematic and effective machine-learning mechanism to understand, analyze, and visualize heterogeneous log files. These techniques enable an automated approach to analyzing log content in real time, learning relevant behaviors, and creating actionable insights applicable in traditionally reactive situations. Using this approach, companies can now tap into a wealth of knowledge residing in log file data that is currently being collected but underutilized because of its overwhelming variety and volume. By using log files as an important data input into the larger enterprise data supply chain, businesses have the opportunity to enhance their current operational log management solution and generate entirely new business insights-no longer limited to the realm of reactive IT management, but extending from proactive product improvement to defense from attacks. As we will discuss, this solution has immediate relevance in the telecommunications and security industries. However, the most forward-looking companies can take it even further. How? By thinking beyond the log file and applying the same machine-learning framework to other log file use cases (including logistics, social media, and consumer behavior) and any other transactional data source.

AB Genotyping tumor tissue in search of somatic genetic alterations for actionable information has become routine practice in clinical oncology. Although these sequence alterations are highly informative, sampling tumor tissue has significant inherent limitations; tumor tissue is a single snapshot in time, is subject to selection bias resulting from tumor heterogeneity, and can be difficult to obtain. Cell-free fragments of DNA are shed into the bloodstream by cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis, and the load of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) correlates with tumor staging and prognosis. Moreover, recent advances in the sensitivity and accuracy of DNA analysis have allowed for genotyping of cfDNA for somatic genomic alterations found in tumors. The ability to detect and quantify tumor mutations has proven effective in tracking tumor dynamics in real time as well as serving as a liquid biopsy that can be used for a variety of clinical and investigational applications not previously possible.

AB BACKGROUND: The importance of a strong safety culture for enhancing patient safety has been stated for over a decade in healthcare. However, this complex construct continues to face definitional and measurement challenges. Continuing improvements in the measurement of this construct are necessary for enhancing the utility of patient safety climate surveys (PSCS) in research and in practice. This study examines the revised Canadian PSCS (Can-PSCS) for use across a range of care settings.; METHODS: Confirmatory factor analytical approaches are used to extensively test the Can-PSCS. Initial and cross-validation samples include 13 126 and 6324 direct care providers from 119 and 35 health settings across Canada, respectively.; RESULTS: Results support a parsimonious model of direct care provider perceptions of patient safety climate (PSC) with 19 items in six dimensions: (1) organisational leadership support for safety; (2) incident follow-up; (3) supervisory leadership for safety; (4) unit learning culture; (5) enabling open communication I: judgement-free environment; (6) enabling open communication II: job repercussions of error. Results also support the validity of the Can-PSCS across a range of care settings.; CONCLUSIONS: The Can-PSCS has several advantages: (1) it is a theory-based instrument with a small number of actionable dimensions central to the construct of PSC; (2) it has robust psychometric properties; (3) it is validated for use across a range of care settings, therefore suitable for use in regionalised health delivery systems and can help to raise expectations about acceptable levels of PSC across the system; (4) it has been tested in a publicly funded universal health insurance system and may be suitable for similar international systems.

AB UNLABELLED: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathologic complete response (pCR) in approximately 30% of patients with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). In patients lacking a pCR, NAC selects a subpopulation of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. To understand the molecular underpinnings driving treatment-resistant TNBCs, we performed comprehensive molecular analyses on the residual disease of 74 clinically defined TNBCs after NAC, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 20 matched pretreatment biopsies. Combined NGS and digital RNA expression analysis identified diverse molecular lesions and pathway activation in drug-resistant tumor cells. Ninety percent of the tumors contained a genetic alteration potentially treatable with a currently available targeted therapy. Thus, profiling residual TNBCs after NAC identifies targetable molecular lesions in the chemotherapy-resistant component of the tumor, which may mirror micrometastases destined to recur clinically. These data can guide biomarker-driven adjuvant studies targeting these micrometastases to improve the outcome of patients with TNBC who do not respond completely to NAC.; SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the spectrum of genomic alterations present in residual TNBC after NAC. Because TNBCs that do not achieve a CR after NAC are likely to recur as metastatic disease at variable times after surgery, these alterations may guide the selection of targeted therapies immediately after mastectomy before these metastases become evident. 2013 AACR

AB We have learned a remarkable amount in recent decades about genomics and its potential contributions to human health and medical practice. However, genomic sequencing technology, which is starting to become incorporated into clinical care, also raises ethical challenges. In particular, there has been significant debate about the appropriate management of genomic incidental findings (GIFs), which we define as pathogenic or likely pathogenic test results that are not apparently relevant to the diagnostic indications for which the tests were ordered. Although there is an emerging consensus that clinicians will have at least some obligation to disclose GIFs to patients, the scope of that obligation is unclear. This commentary identifies nuanced issues that clinicians will likely face in the foreseeable future regarding their emerging obligations to disclose clinically actionable GIFs. Will clinicians be expected to look actively for GIFs? Should GIFs for adult-onset disorders be disclosed to children? What obligations will clinicians have to disclose GIFs to family members of deceased patients? What role should informed consent play? There is value to exploring the range of views on these questions at this time, before genomic sequencing has fully matured as a technology, so that clinicians can anticipate how they will respond to the discovery of GIFs once sequencing becomes a more routine part of clinical care. Genomics is ultimately going to play an important role in the practice of pulmonary medicine, and it is important for pulmonologists and other subspecialists to be well informed about what to expect.

AB The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme contributes to the metabolism and/or bioactivation of approximately 25% of clinically used drugs. The CYP2D6 gene locus is highly polymorphic and complex, and variants within this gene locus affect CYP2D6 enzymatic function resulting in a wide range of metabolic activity from little to no activity to ultrarapid metabolism. For many of the drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, the variation in metabolic activity is one of the most important factors responsible for interindividual drug response. Therefore, determining an individual's CYP2D6 phenotype, or metabolic status, will help identify individuals that may benefit from a change in drug or drug dosage. Genotype analysis has become the method of choice to predict a person's metabolic status. Numerous reference laboratories now offer CYP2D6 genotyping; however, there can be substantial differences in the number of genetic variants interrogated as well as test interpretation. Furthermore, there is no standardized process of how a CYP2D6 genotype result is translated into a phenotype assignment. This review summarizes the complexity of CYP2D6 genotyping and highlights the major challenges for phenotype classification. We call for the implementation of a universally accepted system for CYP2D6 phenotype assignment to promote consistency of test interpretation among reference laboratories and medical institutions. We propose a system that utilizes the CYP2D6 activity score system to place individuals into a continuum of activity scores - rather than using the traditional poor, intermediate, extensive and ultra-rapid metabolizer categorizations - and directly translating activity scores into clinically actionable recommendations.

AB There has been growing interest in biomarker-driven personalized cancer therapy, also known as precision medicine. Recently, dozens of molecular tests, including next generation sequencing, have been developed to detect biomarkers that have the potential to predict response of cancers to particular targeted therapies. However, detection of cancer-related biomarkers is only the first step in the battle. Deciding what therapy options to pursue can also be daunting, especially when tumors harbor more than one potentially actionable aberration. Further, different mutations/variants in a single gene may have different functional consequences, and response to targeted agents may be context dependent. However, early clinical trials with new molecular entities are increasingly conducted in a biomarker-selected fashion, and even when trials are not biomarker-selected, much effort is placed on enrolling patients onto clinical trials where they have the highest probability of response. We review available molecular tests and therapy discerning tools, including tools available for assessing functional consequences of molecular alterations and tools for finding applicable clinical trials, which exist to help bridge the gap between detection of cancer-related biomarker to the initiation of biomarker-matched targeted therapies.

AB This study identifies factors that affect decisions people make regarding whether they want to receive life-sustaining treatment. It is an interpretive-descriptive study based on qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 23), representing a diverse population in central Pennsylvania. Study sites included a suburban senior center serving a primarily White, middle-class population; an urban senior center serving a frail, underserved, African American population; and a breast cancer support group. The most important factors affecting whether participants wished to receive life-sustaining medical treatment were prognosis, expected quality of life, burden to others, burden to oneself in terms of the medical condition and treatment, and effect on mental functioning and independence. Our findings contribute to the knowledge of the complex factors that influence how people make decisions about advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments. This understanding is critical if nurses are to translate the patient's goals, values, and preferences into an actionable medical plan. Copyright 2014, SLACK Incorporated.

AB BACKGROUND: Active clinical decision support (CDS) delivered through an electronic health record (EHR) facilitates gene-based drug prescribing and other applications of genomics to patient care.; OBJECTIVE: We describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of active CDS for multiple pharmacogenetic test results reported preemptively.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical pharmacogenetic test results accompanied by clinical interpretations are placed into the patient's EHR, typically before a relevant drug is prescribed. Problem list entries created for high-risk phenotypes provide an unambiguous trigger for delivery of post-test alerts to clinicians when high-risk drugs are prescribed. In addition, pre-test alerts are issued if a very-high risk medication is prescribed (eg, a thiopurine), prior to the appropriate pharmacogenetic test result being entered into the EHR. Our CDS can be readily modified to incorporate new genes or high-risk drugs as they emerge.; RESULTS: Through November 2012, 35 customized pharmacogenetic rules have been implemented, including rules for TPMT with azathioprine, thioguanine, and mercaptopurine, and for CYP2D6 with codeine, tramadol, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine. Between May 2011 and November 2012, the pre-test alerts were electronically issued 1106 times (76 for thiopurines and 1030 for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6), and the post-test alerts were issued 1552 times (1521 for TPMT and 31 for CYP2D6). Analysis of alert outcomes revealed that the interruptive CDS appropriately guided prescribing in 95% of patients for whom they were issued.; CONCLUSIONS: Our experience illustrates the feasibility of developing computational systems that provide clinicians with actionable alerts for gene-based drug prescribing at the point of care.

AB Although urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the urinary bladder generally portends a favorable prognosis, metastatic tumors often follow an aggressive clinical course. DNA was extracted from 40mum of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from 35 stage IV UCs that had relapsed and progressed after primary surgery and conventional chemotherapy. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries for 3320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer to at an average sequencing depth of 1164 * and evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GAs). Actionable GAs were defined as those impacting the selection of targeted anticancer therapies on the market or in registered clinical trials. A total of 139 GAs were identified, with an average of 4.0 GAs per tumor (range 0-10), of which 78 (56%) were considered actionable, with an average of 2.2 per tumor (range 0-7). Twenty-nine (83%) cases harbored at least one actionable GA including: PIK3CA (9 cases; 26%); CDKN2A/B (8 cases; 23%); CCND1 (5 cases; 14%); FGFR1 (5 cases; 14%); CCND3 (4 cases; 11%); FGFR3 (4 cases; 11%); MCL1 (4 cases; 11%); MDM2 (4 cases; 11%); EGFR (2 cases, 6%); ERBB2 (HER2/neu) (2 cases, 6%); NF1 (2 cases, 6%) and TSC1 (2 cases, 6%). Notable additional alterations included TP53 (19 cases, 54%) and RB1 (6 cases; 17%). Genes involved in chromatin modification were altered by nonsense mutation, splice site mutation or frameshift indel in a mutually exclusive manner in nearly half of all cases including KDM6A (10 cases; 29%) and ARID1A (7 cases; 20%). Comprehensive NGS of 35 UCs of the bladder revealed a diverse spectrum of actionable GAs in 83% of cases, which has the potential to inform treatment decisions for patients with relapsed and metastatic disease.

AB In this proof-of-principle study, we sought to define whether targeted capture massively parallel sequencing can be employed to determine the origin of metastatic deposits in cases of synchronous primary malignancies and metastases in distinct anatomical sites. DNA samples extracted from synchronous tumor masses in the breast, adnexal, and pelvic-peritoneal regions from a 62-year-old BRCA1 germline mutation carrier were subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing using a platform comprising 300 cancer genes known to harbor actionable mutations. In addition to BRCA1 germline mutations, all lesions harbored somatic loss of the BRCA1 wild-type allele and TP53 somatic mutations. The primary breast cancer displayed a TP53 frameshift (p.Q317fs) mutation, whereas and the adnexal lesion harbored a TP53 nonsense (p.R213*) mutation, consistent with a diagnosis of two independent primary tumors (i.e. breast and ovarian cancer). The adnexal tumor and all pelvic-peritoneal implants harbored identical TP53 (p.R213*) and NCOA2 (p.G952R) somatic mutations. Evidence of genetic heterogeneity within and between lesions was observed, both in terms of somatic mutations and copy number aberrations. The repertoires of somatic genetic aberrations found in the breast, ovarian, and pelvic-peritoneal lesions provided direct evidence in support of the distinct origin of the breast and ovarian cancers, and established that the pelvic-peritoneal implants were clonally related to the ovarian lesion. These observations were consistent with those obtained with immunohistochemical analyses employing markers to differentiate between carcinomas of the breast and ovary, including WT1 and PAX8. Our results on this case of a patient with BRCA1-mutant breast and ovarian cancer demonstrate that massively parallel sequencing may constitute a useful tool to define the relationship, clonality and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity between primary tumor masses and their metastatic deposits in patients with multiple primary malignancies and synchronous metastases.

AB Neurocritical care relies on the continuous, real-time measurement of numerous physiologic parameters. While our capability to obtain such measurements from patients has grown markedly with multimodal monitoring in many neurologic or neurosurgical intensive care units (ICUs), our ability to transform the raw data into actionable information is limited. One reason is that the proprietary nature of medical devices and software often prevents neuro-ICUs from capturing and centrally storing high-density data. Also, ICU alarm systems are often unreliable because the data that are captured are riddled with artifacts. Informatics is the process of acquiring, processing, and interpreting these complex arrays of data. The development of next-generation informatics tools allows for detection of complex physiologic events and brings about the possibility of decision support tools to improve neurocritical care. Although many different approaches to informatics are discussed and considered, here we focus on the Bayesian probabilistic paradigm. It quantifies the uncertainty inherent in neurocritical care instead of ignoring it, and formalizes the natural clinical thought process of updating prior beliefs using incoming patient data. We review this and other opportunities, as well as challenges, for the development and refinement of informatics tools in neurocritical care.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify actionable predictors of remission to antidepressant pharmacotherapy in depressed older adults and to use signal detection theory to develop decision trees to guide clinical decision making.; METHOD: We treated 277 participants with current major depression using open-label venlafaxine XR (up to 300 mg/day) for 12 weeks, in an NIMH-sponsored randomized, placebo-controlled augmentation trial of adjunctive aripiprazole. Multiple logistic regression and signal detection approaches identified predictors of remission in both completer and intent-to-treat samples.; RESULTS: Higher baseline depressive symptom severity (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-0.93; p<0.001), smaller symptom improvement during the first two weeks of treatment (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.97; p<0.001), male sex (OR: 0.41 95% CI: 0.18-0.93; p= 0.03), duration of current episode≥2 years (OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.12-0.57; p<0.001) and adequate past depression treatment (ATHF≥3) (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16-0.74; p= 0.006) predicted lower probability of remission in the completer sample. Subjects with Montgomery Asberg (MADRS) decreasing by greater than 27% in the first 2 weeks and with baseline MADRS scores of less than 27 (percentile rank= 51) had the best chance of remission (89%). Subjects with small symptom decrease in the first 2 weeks with adequate prior treatment and younger than 75 years old had the lowest chance of remission (16%).; CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the clinical utility of measuring pre-treatment illness severity and change during the first 2 weeks of treatment in predicting remission of late-life major depression.

AB We hypothesized that next-generation sequencing could reveal actionable genomic alterations (GAs) and potentially expand treatment options for patients with advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed on hybridization-captured, adapter ligation libraries derived from 28 relapsed and metastatic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ACC. The 3230 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer were fully sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000. All classes of GAs were evaluated. Actionable GAs were defined as those impacting targeted anticancer therapies on the market or in registered clinical trials. A total of 44 GAs were identified in the 28 ACC tumors, with 12 of 28 (42.9%) of tumors harboring at least 1 potentially actionable GA. The most common nonactionable GAs were identified in KD6MA (5 cases; 18%), ARID1A (4 cases; 14%), RUNX1 (2 cases; 7%), and MYC (2 cases; 7%). Actionable GAs included NOTCH1 (3 cases; 11%), MDM2 (2 cases; 7%), PDGFRA (2 cases; 7%), and CDKN2A/B (p16) (2 cases; 7%). Other potentially actionable GAs identified in a single case included: mutations in AKT1, BAP1, EGFR, and PIK3CA, homozygous deletion of FBXW7, and amplifications of CDK4, FGFR1, IGF1R, KDR, KIT, and MCL1. The frequency of GA in ACC is lower than that seen in the more common solid tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling of ACC can identify actionable GAs in a subset of patients that could influence therapy for these difficult-to-treat progressive neoplasms.

AB Airway abnormalities are frequently associated with congenital heart disease in infants and children. Respiratory distress in these children frequently requires prolonged respiratory support. Wide-detector dynamic pulmonary computed tomography angiography (DP-CTA) is a non-invasive technique that completely evaluates vascular and airway abnormalities during a single breathe. Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of DP-CTA to provide unique actionable information for patient care in newborns and infants with congenital heart disease and persistent respiratory distress. 23 infants with congenital heart disease and persistent respiratory distress underwent DP-CTA. All were intubated at the time of the examinations. The most common cardiac anomalies were tetralogy of Fallot (6) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome variants (5). The most common cardiac surgeries prior to DP-CTA were Norwood (4) and hybrid (3) procedures. The protocol for DP-CTA for intubated infants is four gantry rotations in 1.4 s after intravenous contrast injection. 3D and multiplanar reconstruction with cine loops were created for combined cardiopulmonary imaging. Tracheobronchomalacia was present in 17 children. Lobar bronchomalacia was identified in six children. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis was the most common vascular finding (10 children). Medical management was changed or a surgical procedure performed based on the information resulting from DP-CTA in 16 of the 23 patients (70 %). DP-CTA is non-invasive, fast and provides unique information for the management of infants with congenital heart disease and persistent respiratory distress. DP-CTA is uniquely suited for comprehensive and simultaneous evaluation of airway and vascular abnormalities in infants.

AB Accurate classification is essential for understanding the pathophysiology of a disease and can inform therapeutic choices. For hematopoietic malignancies, a classification scheme based on the phenotypic similarity between tumor cells and normal cells has been successfully used to define tumor subtypes; however, use of normal cell types as a reference by which to classify solid tumors has not been widely emulated, in part due to more limited understanding of epithelial cell differentiation compared with hematopoiesis. To provide a better definition of the subtypes of epithelial cells comprising the breast epithelium, we performed a systematic analysis of a large set of breast epithelial markers in more than 15,000 normal breast cells, which identified 11 differentiation states for normal luminal cells. We then applied information from this analysis to classify human breast tumors based on normal cell types into 4 major subtypes, HR0-HR3, which were differentiated by vitamin D, androgen, and estrogen hormone receptor (HR) expression. Examination of 3,157 human breast tumors revealed that these HR subtypes were distinct from the current classification scheme, which is based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Patient outcomes were best when tumors expressed all 3 hormone receptors (subtype HR3) and worst when they expressed none of the receptors (subtype HR0). Together, these data provide an ontological classification scheme associated with patient survival differences and provides actionable insights for treating breast tumors.

AB Advanced cholangiocarcinoma continues to harbor a difficult prognosis and therapeutic options have been limited. During the course of a clinical trial of whole genomic sequencing seeking druggable targets, we examined six patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Integrated genome-wide and whole transcriptome sequence analyses were performed on tumors from six patients with advanced, sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (SIC) to identify potential therapeutically actionable events. Among the somatic events captured in our analysis, we uncovered two novel therapeutically relevant genomic contexts that when acted upon, resulted in preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Genome-wide structural analysis of sequence data revealed recurrent translocation events involving the FGFR2 locus in three of six assessed patients. These observations and supporting evidence triggered the use of FGFR inhibitors in these patients. In one example, preliminary anti-tumor activity of pazopanib (in vitro FGFR2 IC50350 nM) was noted in a patient with an FGFR2-TACC3 fusion. After progression on pazopanib, the same patient also had stable disease on ponatinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor (in vitro, FGFR2 IC508 nM). In an independent non-FGFR2 translocation patient, exome and transcriptome analysis revealed an allele specific somatic nonsense mutation (E384X) in ERRFI1, a direct negative regulator of EGFR activation. Rapid and robust disease regression was noted in this ERRFI1 inactivated tumor when treated with erlotinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor. FGFR2 fusions and ERRFI mutations may represent novel targets in sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and trials should be characterized in larger cohorts of patients with these aberrations.

AB Despite a wealth of preclinical studies, it is unclear whether PIK3CA or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene aberrations are actionable in the clinical setting. Of 1,656 patients with advanced, refractory cancers tested for PIK3CA or PTEN abnormalities, PIK3CA mutations were found in 9% (146/1,589), and PTEN loss and/or mutation was found in 13% (149/1,157). In multicovariable analysis, treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor was the only independent factor predicting response to therapy in individuals harboring a PIK3CA or PTEN aberration. The rate of stable disease ≥6 months/partial response reached 45% in a subgroup of individuals with H1047R PIK3CA mutations. Aberrations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are common and potentially actionable in patients with diverse advanced cancers. This work provides further important clinical validation for continued and accelerated use of biomarker-driven trials incorporating rational drug combinations. Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

AB China is facing the great challenge of serving the world's largest rare disease population. It is necessary to develop a specific medical plan to increase the levels of optimal prevention, diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases under the existing clinical service structures in China. In 2013, China launched its first pilot project focused on 20 representative rare diseases. A national network including approximately 100 provincial or municipal medical centers has been established to enable collaboration on rare diseases across China. The main objectives for this project are to develop and apply medical guidelines and clinical pathways for rare diseases, to establish a rare disease patient registry and data repository system, and to promote molecular testing for rare genetic disorders. This project also emphasizes building close links among the collaborative network, clinicians on the frontlines in basic medical services institutions and rare disease patient organizations. Primarily, this project expects to develop an actionable medical services plan to increase the delivery of quality healthcare for individuals and families living with rare diseases in China within five years.

AB PURPOSE: Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most prevalent type of lung cancer. Currently, no targeted therapeutics are approved for treatment of this cancer, largely because of a lack of systematic understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. To identify therapeutic targets and perform comparative analyses of lung SCC, we probed somatic genome alterations of lung SCC by using samples from Korean patients.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from 104 lung SCC samples from Korean patients and matched normal DNA. In addition, copy-number analysis and transcriptome analysis were conducted for a subset of these samples. Clinical association with cancer-specific somatic alterations was investigated.; RESULTS: This cancer cohort is characterized by a high mutational burden with an average of 261 somatic exonic mutations per tumor and a mutational spectrum showing a signature of exposure to cigarette smoke. Seven genes demonstrated statistical enrichment for mutation: TP53, RB1, PTEN, NFE2L2, KEAP1, MLL2, and PIK3CA). Comparative analysis between Korean and North American lung SCC samples demonstrated a similar spectrum of alterations in these two populations in contrast to the differences seen in lung adenocarcinoma. We also uncovered recurrent occurrence of therapeutically actionable FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in lung SCC.; CONCLUSION: These findings provide new steps toward the identification of genomic target candidates for precision medicine in lung SCC, a disease with significant unmet medical needs.

AB We describe the development and implementation of a randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of genomic counseling on a cohort of patients with heart failure (HF) or hypertension (HTN), managed at a large academic medical center, the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). Our study is built upon the existing Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (CPMC). OSUWMC patient participants with chronic disease (CD) receive eight actionable complex disease and one pharmacogenomic test report through the CPMC web portal. Participants are randomized to either the in-person post-test genomic counseling-active arm, versus web-based only return of results-control arm. Study-specific surveys measure: (1) change in risk perception; (2) knowledge retention; (3) perceived personal control; (4) health behavior change; and, for the active arm (5), overall satisfaction with genomic counseling. This ongoing partnership has spurred creation of both infrastructure and procedures necessary for the implementation of genomics and genomic counseling in clinical care and clinical research. This included creation of a comprehensive informed consent document and processes for prospective return of actionable results for multiple complex diseases and pharmacogenomics (PGx) through a web portal, and integration of genomic data files and clinical decision support into an EPIC-based electronic medical record. We present this partnership, the infrastructure, genomic counseling approach, and the challenges that arose in the design and conduct of this ongoing trial to inform subsequent collaborative efforts and best genomic counseling practices.

AB Despite widespread use of clinical guidelines, actual care often falls short of ideal standards. Electronic health records (EHR) can be analyzed to provide information on how to improve care, but this is seldom done in sufficient detail to guide specific action. We developed an algorithm to provide practical, actionable information for care quality improvement using blood pressure (BP) management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an exemplar. We used UK clinical guidelines and EHR data from 440 patients in Salford (UK) to develop the algorithm. We then applied it to 532,409 individual patient records, identifying 11,097 CKD patients, 3,766 (34%) of which showed room for improvement in their care: either through medication optimization or better BP monitoring. Manual record reviews to evaluate accuracy indicated a positive-predictive value of 90%. Such algorithms could help improve the management of chronic conditions by providing the missing link between clinical audit and decision support.

AB The rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHR) provides a comprehensive source for exploratory and predictive analytic to support clinical decision-making. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize EHR to tailor treatments to individual patients based on their likelihood to respond to a therapy. We construct a heterogeneous graph which includes two domains (patients and drugs) and encodes three relationships (patient similarity, drug similarity, and patient-drug prior associations). We describe a novel approach for performing a label propagation procedure to spread the label information representing the effectiveness of different drugs for different patients over this heterogeneous graph. The proposed method has been applied on a real-world EHR dataset to help identify personalized treatments for hypercholesterolemia. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and suggest that the combination of appropriate patient similarity and drug similarity analytics could lead to actionable insights for personalized medicine. Particularly, by leveraging drug similarity in combination with patient similarity, our method could perform well even on new or rarely used drugs for which there are few records of known past performance.

AB Because it is the product of glycolysis and main substrate for mitochondrial respiration, lactate is the central metabolic intermediate in cerebral energy substrate delivery. Our recent studies on healthy controls and patients following traumatic brain injury (TBI) using [6,6-(2)H2]glucose and [3-(13)C]lactate, along with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial-venous (jugular bulb) difference measurements for oxygen, metabolite levels, isotopic enrichments and (13)CO2 show a massive and previously unrecognized mobilization of lactate from corporeal (muscle, skin, and other) glycogen reserves in TBI patients who were studied 5.7 ± 2.2 days after injury at which time brain oxygen consumption and glucose uptake (CMRO2 and CMRgluc, respectively) were depressed. By tracking the incorporation of the (13)C from lactate tracer we found that gluconeogenesis (GNG) from lactate accounted for 67.1 ± 6.9%, of whole-body glucose appearance rate (Ra) in TBI, which was compared to 15.2 ± 2.8% (mean ± SD, respectively) in healthy, well-nourished controls. Standard of care treatment of TBI patients in state-of-the-art facilities by talented and dedicated heath care professionals reveals presence of a catabolic Body Energy State (BES). Results are interpreted to mean that additional nutritive support is required to fuel the body and brain following TBI. Use of a diagnostic to monitor BES to provide health care professionals with actionable data in providing nutritive formulations to fuel the body and brain and achieve exquisite glycemic control are discussed. In particular, the advantages of using inorganic and organic lactate salts, esters and other compounds are examined. To date, several investigations on brain-injured patients with intact hepatic and renal functions show that compared to dextrose + insulin treatment, exogenous lactate infusion results in normal glycemia.

AB OBJECTIVES: We describe an innovative community-centered participatory design approach, Consumer-centered Participatory Design (C2PD), and the results of applying C2PD to design and develop a web-based fall prevention system.; METHODS: We conducted focus groups and design sessions with English- and Spanish-speaking community-dwelling older adults. Focus group data were summarized and used to inform the context of the design sessions. Descriptive content analysis methods were used to develop categorical descriptions of design session informant's needs related to information technology.; RESULTS: The C2PD approach enabled the assessment and identification of informant's needs of health information technology (HIT) that informed the development of a falls prevention system. We learned that our informants needed a system that provides variation in functions/content; differentiates between actionable/non-actionable information/structures; and contains sensory cues that support wide-ranging and complex tasks in a varied, simple, and clear interface to facilitate self-management.; CONCLUSIONS: The C2PD approach provides community-based organizations, academic researchers, and commercial entities with a systematic theoretically informed approach to develop HIT innovations. Our community-centered participatory design approach focuses on consumer's technology needs while taking into account core public health functions.

AB OBJECTIVES: Various computerized health risk appraisals (HRAs) are available, but few of them assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a goal-directed framework. This study describes the user-centered development and usability testing of an innovative HRQoL module that extends a validated HRA tool in primary care settings.; METHODS: Systematic user-centered design, usability testing, and qualitative methods were used to develop the HRQoL module in primary care practices. Twenty two patients and 5 clinicians participated in two rounds of interactive technology think-out-loud sessions (TOLs) and semi-structured interviews (SSIs) to iteratively develop a four-step, computerized process that collects information on patient goals for meaningful life activities and current level of disability and presents a personalized and prioritized list of preventive recommendations linked to online resources.; RESULTS: Analysis of TOLs and SSIs generated 5 categories and 11 sub-categories related to facilitators and barriers to usability and human-technology interaction. The categories included: Understanding the Purpose, Usability, Perceived Value, Literacy, and Participant Motivation. Some categories were inter-connected. The technology was continually and iteratively improved between sessions until saturation of positive feedback was achieved in 4 categories (addressing motivation will require more research). Usability of all screen units of the module was improved substantially. Clinician feedback emphasized the importance of the module's ability to translate the patient-centered HRQoL Report into actionable items for clinicians to facilitate shared decision-making. Complete integration of the HRQoL module into the existing HRA will require further development and testing.; CONCLUSIONS: Systematic application of user-centered design and human factors principles in technology development and testing may significantly improve the usability and clinical value of health information systems. This more sophisticated approach helped us translate complex clinical concepts, goal-setting steps, and decision-support processes into an accepted and value-added technology.

AB The increasing scope and availability of genetic testing options for patients suffering from cancer has raised questions about how to use results of molecular diagnostics to inform patient care. For some biomarkers (e.g. BRAF mutations in melanoma), standards exist that outline treatments for individuals harboring aberrations in the biomarker; however for the vast majority of genomic abnormalities, few guidelines exist. Clinical decision making and the therapeutic approach for a patient with a given cancer characterized by aberrations in different genes may be aided by the use of a biomarker actionability framework that provides levels of evidence regarding whether and how a molecular abnormality can be considered a therapeutically relevant biomarker. A gene may be considered theoretically actionable if it has a basis of actionability, such that clinically available drugs can target a gene product that drives the cancer or is differentially expressed in tumor versus normal elements. Herein, we discuss a possible framework for developing guidelines for actionability, as they relate to genomically-based cancer therapeutics.

AB The federal government advocates the practice of routinely providing an after-visit summary (AVS) to patients after each office-based visit as an element of stage 1 meaningful use. A significant potential benefit of the AVS is improved patient engagement achieved by enabling patients and family members to better understand and retain key health information. The methodology for this study was a mixed-methods pilot study to examine, through the perspectives of adult primary care patients, how relevant and actionable data can be better formatted in the AVS. Results of this study suggest that the goal of the AVS to serve as a communication tool to engage and support patients is frequently not being met. Further study is needed to understand, from the viewpoints of patients and providers, what barriers are keeping them from optimally providing and using the information on the AVS.

AB Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is associated with a decline in prostate cancer-related mortality. However, screening has also led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant tumors. Recently, certain national guidelines (eg, US Preventive Services Task Force) have recommended against PSA screening, which may lead to a reverse-stage migration. Although many prostate tumors are indolent at presentation, others are aggressive and are appropriate targets for treatment interventions. Utilization of molecular markers may improve our ability to measure tumor biology and allow better discrimination of indolent and aggressive tumors at diagnosis. Many emerging commercial molecular diagnostic assays have been designed to provide more accurate risk stratification for newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Unfamiliarity with molecular diagnostics may make it challenging for some clinicians to navigate and interpret the medical literature to ascertain whether particular assays are appropriately developed and validated for clinical use. Herein, the authors provide a framework for practitioners to use when assessing new tissue-based molecular assays. This review outlines aspects of assay development, clinical and analytic validation and clinical utility studies, and regulatory issues, which collectively determine whether tests (1) are actionable for specific clinical indications, (2) measurably influence treatment decisions, and (3) are sufficiently validated to warrant incorporation into clinical practice.

AB PURPOSE: Physiologic monitors are plagued with alarms that create a cacophony of sounds and visual alerts causing "alarm fatigue" which creates an unsafe patient environment because a life-threatening event may be missed in this milieu of sensory overload. Using a state-of-the-art technology acquisition infrastructure, all monitor data including 7 ECG leads, all pressure, SpO(2), and respiration waveforms as well as user settings and alarms were stored on 461 adults treated in intensive care units. Using a well-defined alarm annotation protocol, nurse scientists with 95% inter-rater reliability annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms.; RESULTS: A total of 2,558,760 unique alarms occurred in the 31-day study period: arrhythmia, 1,154,201; parameter, 612,927; technical, 791,632. There were 381,560 audible alarms for an audible alarm burden of 187/bed/day. 88.8% of the 12,671 annotated arrhythmia alarms were false positives. Conditions causing excessive alarms included inappropriate alarm settings, persistent atrial fibrillation, and non-actionable events such as PVC's and brief spikes in ST segments. Low amplitude QRS complexes in some, but not all available ECG leads caused undercounting and false arrhythmia alarms. Wide QRS complexes due to bundle branch block or ventricular pacemaker rhythm caused false alarms. 93% of the 168 true ventricular tachycardia alarms were not sustained long enough to warrant treatment.; DISCUSSION: The excessive number of physiologic monitor alarms is a complex interplay of inappropriate user settings, patient conditions, and algorithm deficiencies. Device solutions should focus on use of all available ECG leads to identify non-artifact leads and leads with adequate QRS amplitude. Devices should provide prompts to aide in more appropriate tailoring of alarm settings to individual patients. Atrial fibrillation alarms should be limited to new onset and termination of the arrhythmia and delays for ST-segment and other parameter alarms should be configurable. Because computer devices are more reliable than humans, an opportunity exists to improve physiologic monitoring and reduce alarm fatigue.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical impact of chromosomal microarray (CMA) on the management of paediatric patients in Hong Kong.; METHODS: We performed NimbleGen 135k oligonucleotide array on 327 children with intellectual disability (ID)/developmental delay (DD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and/or multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs) in a university-affiliated paediatric unit from January 2011 to May 2013. The medical records of patients were reviewed in September 2013, focusing on the pathogenic/likely pathogenic CMA findings and their "clinical actionability" based on established criteria.; RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were reported to have pathogenic/likely pathogenic results, while 40 had findings of unknown significance. This gives a detection rate of 11% for clinically significant (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) findings. The significant findings have prompted clinical actions in 28 out of 37 patients (75.7%), while the findings with unknown significance have led to further management recommendation in only 1 patient (p < 0.001). Nineteen out of the 28 management recommendations are "evidence-based" on either practice guidelines endorsed by a professional society (n = 9, Level 1) or peer-reviewed publications making medical management recommendation (n = 10, Level 2). CMA results impact medical management by precipitating referral to a specialist (n = 24); diagnostic testing (n = 25), surveillance of complications (n = 19), interventional procedure (n = 7), medication (n = 15) or lifestyle modification (n = 12).; CONCLUSION: The application of CMA in children with ID/DD, ASD, and/or MCAs in Hong Kong results in a diagnostic yield of  11% for pathogenic/likely pathogenic results. Importantly the yield for clinically actionable results is 8.6%. We advocate using diagnostic yield of clinically actionable results to evaluate CMA as it provides information of both clinical validity and clinical utility. Furthermore, it incorporates evidence-based medicine into the practice of genomic medicine. The same framework can be applied to other genomic testing strategies enabled by next-generation sequencing.

AB Recent advances in sequencing technology have allowed us to profile genome-wide mutations of various cancer types, revealing huge heterogeneity of cancer genome variations. However, its heterogeneous landscape of somatic mutations according to liver cancer progression is not fully understood. Here, we profiled the mutations and gene expressions of early and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related with Hepatitis B-viral infection. Integrative analysis was performed with whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiles of the 12 cases of early and advanced HCCs and paired non-tumoral adjacent liver tissues. A total of 293 tumor-specific somatic variants and 202 non-tumoral variants were identified. The tumor-specific variants were found to be enriched at chromosome 1q particularly in the advanced HCC, compared to the non-tumoral variants. Functional enrichment analysis revealed frequent mutations at the genes encoding cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, and cell cycle-related genes. In addition, to elucidate actionable somatic mutations, we performed an integrative analysis of gene mutations and gene expression profiles together. This revealed the 48 mutated genes which were differentially mutated with concomitant gene expression enrichment. Of these, CTNNB1 was found to have a pivotal role in the differential progression of the HCC subgroup. In conclusion, our integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome profiles could provide actionable mutations which might play pivotal roles in the heterogeneous progression of HCC.

AB Since the discovery of tumour initiating cells (TICs) in solid tumours, studies focussing on their role in cancer initiation and progression have abounded. The biological interrogation of these cells continues to yield volumes of information on their pro-tumourigenic behaviour, but actionable generalised conclusions have been scarce. Further, new information suggesting a dependence of tumour composition and growth on the microenvironment has yet to be studied theoretically. To address this point, we created a hybrid, discrete/continuous computational cellular automaton model of a generalised stem-cell driven tissue with a simple microenvironment. Using the model we explored the phenotypic traits inherent to the tumour initiating cells and the effect of the microenvironment on tissue growth. We identify the regions in phenotype parameter space where TICs are able to cause a disruption in homeostasis, leading to tissue overgrowth and tumour maintenance. As our parameters and model are non-specific, they could apply to any tissue TIC and do not assume specific genetic mutations. Targeting these phenotypic traits could represent a generalizable therapeutic strategy across cancer types. Further, we find that the microenvironmental variable does not strongly affect the outcomes, suggesting a need for direct feedback from the microenvironment onto stem-cell behaviour in future modelling endeavours.

AB BACKGROUND: With the growing use of electronic health record systems, there is a demand for an electronic version of the leading American pediatric preventive care guideline, Bright Futures. As computer implementation requires actionable recommendations, it is important to assess to what degree Bright Futures meets criteria for actionability.; OBJECTIVES: We aimed to 1) determine the number of actionable recommendations in the current edition of Bright Futures and 2) to recommend a specific format for representing an important class of guidelines in a way that better facilitates computer implementation.; METHODS: We consolidated all action statements in Bright Futures into recommendations. We then used two dimensions (decidability and executability) in the Guideline Implementability Appraisal v 2.0 (GLIA) to determine the actionability of the recommendations. Decidability means the recommendation states precisely under what conditions to perform those actions. Executability means actions are stated specifically, unambiguously and in sufficient detail. The results were presented in a figure titled Service Interval Diagram (SID), describing actionable recommendations, age intervals during which they are applicable, and how frequently they should occur in that interval.; RESULTS: We consolidated 2161 action items into 245 recommendations and identified 52 that were actionable (21%). Almost exclusively, these recommendations addressed screening, such as newborn metabolic screening, or child safety, such as car seat use. A limited number (n=13) of recommendations for other areas of anticipatory guidance were also actionable. No recommendations on child discipline, family function or mental health met our criteria for actionability. The SID representing these recommendations is presented in a figure.; CONCLUSION: Only a portion of the Bright Futures Guidelines meets criteria for actionability. Substantial work lies ahead to develop most recommendations for anticipatory guidance into a computer implementable format.

AB Psychotic disorders most commonly appear during the late teenage years and early adulthood. A focused and rapid clinical response by an integrated health team can help to improve the quality of life of the patient, leading to a better long-term prognosis. The Vancouver Coastal Health early psychosis intervention program covers a catchment area of approximately 800,000 people in the cities of Vancouver and Richmond, Canada. The program provides a multidisciplinary approach to supporting patients under the age of 30 who have recently experienced first-break psychosis. The program addresses the needs of the treatment environment, medication, and psychological therapies. A critical part of this support includes a program to specifically improve patients' physical health. Physical health needs are addressed through a two-pronged, parallel approach. Patients receive routine metabolic health assessments during their first year in the program, where standard metabolic parameters are recorded. Based on the results of clinical interviews and laboratory tests, specific actionable interventions are recommended. The second key strategy is a program that promotes healthy lifestyle goal development. Patients work closely with occupational therapists to develop goals to improve cardiometabolic health. These programs are supported by an active research environment, where patients are able to engage in studies with a focus on improving their physical health. These studies include a longitudinal evaluation of the effects of integrated health coaching on maintaining cardiometabolic health in patients recently admitted to the program, as well as a clinical study that evaluates the effects of low versus higher metabolic risk antipsychotic drugs on central adiposity. An additional pharmacogenomic study is helping to identify genetic variants that may predict cardiometabolic changes following treatment with antipsychotic drugs.

AB INTRODUCTION: Identifying educational needs related to professional practice gaps can be a complex process for continuing medical education (CME) committees and for physicians who submit activity applications. Medical librarians possess unique skills that may be useful for identifying practice gaps relevant to CME committees. We assessed this assumption by assessing a medical librarian's contributions to practice gap identification for the Marshfield Clinic's CME Committee.; METHODS: We reviewed all locally relevant, locally actionable practice gaps identified annually by various stakeholders and presented to our CME Committee from 2010 to 2013. Total numbers of practice gaps identified, total categorized as actionable, and numbers of subsequent activities resulting from these gaps were calculated for each year. Medical librarian totals were compared to those of other CME committee stakeholders to determine the relative contribution.; RESULTS: The medical librarian identified unique, actionable published practice gaps that directly contributed to CME activity planning. For each study year, contributions by the medical librarian grew, from 0 of 27 actionable gaps validated by CME Committee in 2010 to 49 of 108 (45.4%) in 2013. With the librarian's assistance, the number of valid practice gaps submitted between 2010 and 2013 by stakeholders climbed from 23 for 155 activities (14.8%) to 133 for 157 activities (84.7%).; CONCLUSION: Medical librarians can provide a valuable service to CME committees by identifying valid professional practice gaps that inform decisions about educational activities aimed at improving clinical practice. Medical librarians bring into deliberations unique information, including national health policy priorities, practice gaps found in the literature, and point-of-care search engine statistics. © 2014 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

AB Cancer patients belonging to the adolescent and young adult (AYA) age group have unique and very specific needs, which require special attention from the caring staff. The difficulty in maintaining the personal and professional development at this age is both natural and normal. Adding to this, coping with a life-threatening disease turns this stage in life into a period with many dilemmas and challenges of quite a complex nature. AYA patients have to deal with issues above and beyond the disease itself, which create a very complex coping picture. On top of that, prognosis for this age group has not improved in recent years, unlike the situation in other age groups like children and adults. The literature on this subject is extensive and comprehensive. However, most of the papers on this subject are very specific and narrow in their approach, each dealing with a specific topic. In this article, we bring together many different papers which make a wide and comprehensive picture of the subject of AYAs coping with cancer, coupled with recommendations for the caring staff. In this review we focus on the various aspects of the disease and treatments in AYAs, based on the conceptual model of quality of life proposed by Ferrell and colleagues [Cancer Nurs 1992;15:153-160; Cancer Nurs 1992;15:247-253], including physical, social, emotional and spiritual aspects. From the psychological standpoint, most of the papers discuss the negative aspects; however, in this article we try to include some articles from the positive psychology school of thought. From our findings it is apparent that there is an opportunity and need to further explore research in this regard. It is apparent that taking a unique approach to AYA cancer patients is needed in order to deal with the unique needs of this age group. This article aims at putting a framework around this issue, with actionable recommendations for the caring staff. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB BACKGROUND: Plasma-derived cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) constitutes a potential surrogate for tumor DNA obtained from tissue biopsies. We posit that massively parallel sequencing (MPS) analysis of ctDNA may help define the repertoire of mutations in breast cancer and monitor tumor somatic alterations during the course of targeted therapy.; PATIENT AND METHODS: A 66-year-old patient presented with synchronous estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative, highly proliferative, grade 2, mixed invasive ductal-lobular carcinoma with bone and liver metastases at diagnosis. DNA extracted from archival tumor material, plasma and peripheral blood leukocytes was subjected to targeted MPS using a platform comprising 300 cancer genes known to harbor actionable mutations. Multiple plasma samples were collected during the fourth line of treatment with an AKT inhibitor.; RESULTS: Average read depths of 287x were obtained from the archival primary tumor, 139x from the liver metastasis and between 200x and 900x from ctDNA samples. Sixteen somatic non-synonymous mutations were detected in the liver metastasis, of which 9 (CDKN2A, AKT1, TP53, JAK3, TSC1, NF1, CDH1, MML3 and CTNNB1) were also detected in >5% of the alleles found in the primary tumor sample. Not all mutations identified in the metastasis were reliably identified in the primary tumor (e.g. FLT4). Analysis of ctDNA, nevertheless, captured all mutations present in the primary tumor and/or liver metastasis. In the longitudinal monitoring of the patient, the mutant allele fractions identified in ctDNA samples varied over time and mirrored the pharmacodynamic response to the targeted therapy as assessed by positron emission tomography-computed tomography.; CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle study is one of the first to demonstrate that high-depth targeted MPS of plasma-derived ctDNA constitutes a potential tool for de novo mutation identification and monitoring of somatic genetic alterations during the course of targeted therapy, and may be employed to overcome the challenges posed by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity.; REGISTERED CLINICAL TRIAL: www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01090960. © The Author 2014.

AB Major efforts have been directed toward the implementation of sustainable quality improvement. To date, progress has been noted using various metrics and performance measures; however, successful implementation has proven challenging. The Quality, Implementation, and Evaluation (QIE) model, derived from Donabedian's structure component, presents a framework for implementation of specific activities. The QIE model consists of Policy, Patient Preparedness, Provider Competency, and Performance and Accountability, to guide specific practice initiatives. The implementation of alcohol-based pre-operative skin prep was evaluated in a sample of 17 hospitals and demonstrated that hospitals actively engaged in the components of the model demonstrated a significantly higher use of alcohol-based skin preparation agent than hospitals that did not engage in QIE model activities. The QIE model presents a powerful and actionable implementation model for mid-level management and clinical leadership. Future studies will further evaluate the impact of the specific components of the QIE model. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB Whether researchers have an obligation to disclose secondary genetic research findings, and, if so, in what circumstances, remains a matter of heated debate. This paper suggests that much of this confusion is definitional or conceptual in nature. That is, there is significant variability in the way that threshold terms and concepts such as "incidental," "analytic validity," "clinical validity," "clinical relevance," "clinical utility," "clinical significance," and "actionability," are used in the literature, which is impeding efforts to clarify the scope of an obligation to return findings. This paper analyzes the definitional muddle underlying the debate about returning genetic research findings, first, to explain the range of definitions being used in this debate. We go on to propose that, underlying all the seeming confusion and disagreement, three central and widely agreed upon concepts are at work in this debate - validity, value, and volition. Refocusing attention on these core concepts, and their appropriate conceptualizations, can produce a more productive debate regarding the return of genetic research findings.  © 2014 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc.

AB The biopsy material that is available for evaluation of the transplant heart is retrieved from an invasive biopsy procedure that is often small or suboptimal for evaluation. It is essential that the tissue is handled optimally from the time it is removed from the body to the time it is placed on the microscope stage to facilitate the best opportunity for an adequate diagnosis and to prevent the necessity for repeat costly and invasive procedures. Furthermore, the diagnostic information may be time sensitive for the treating clinician and mishandling the tissue or requiring a repeat biopsy will delay the start of treatment if the biopsy discloses actionable information. Herein we describe an optimized protocol for handling and interpreting heart transplant biopsies.

AB The premise that all tumors are targetable has been met with some controversy in the approach to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Genomic analysis shows that these tumors (specifically, high-grade serous carcinomas) are genomically unstable and lack actionable driver mutations, much like HER2 in breast and gastric cancers. In this paper, Michael Birrer, MD, PhD, Massachusetts General Hospital, argues that the interpretation of genomic data in ovarian cancer requires a more thoughtful approach that necessitates a closer inspection of the data beyond the mere presence or absence of mutations. We must look at the extensive genomic alterations in DNA and, to understand more about the role of those genes affected by these changes, look beyond the tumor to the role of the stroma. As such, Dr. Birrer is arguing for the importance of translational research. This will be the key to precision medicine in ovarian cancer, as we approach drug discovery and improvements in treatment. Dr. Birrer is a world-renowned scientist who has devoted his career to the study of gynecologic cancers. He has published over 200 papers and written over 27 book chapters and reviews, served on numerous leadership positions in gynecologic oncology (including as co-chair of the National Cancer Institute's Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee), and remains a clinician-scientist with an active lab and an active clinic. His career trajectory has shown me it is possible to be engaged as a researcher and a clinician and the work he has done has already impacted the care of patients with ovarian cancer. Don S.

AB Much of the progress in systemic therapy for sarcomas was accomplished in the first half of the last 5 decades. Various chemotherapeutic agents were tested in the 70s through the 80s and became part of the standard of care for this patient population. During the decade of the 90s, dose intensification became feasible as a result of improved supportive care and the availability of growth factors, thus maximizing the therapeutic potential of this class of agents. However, response rates and survival plateaued and it became obvious that newer and mechanistically different agents were needed to improve the therapeutic index and gain further enhancement of outcomes. Since early 2000, primarily inspired by the experience with imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), several targeted therapies have been tested in sarcomas with modest success. The major limitations encountered include the lack of drivers and actionable targets for bone and soft tissue sarcomas with complex genomic profiles. Continued investigations and sequencing of larger numbers of these rare and heterogeneous malignancies could shed some light on a path toward improved outcomes.

AB Bladder cancer is a disease of older patients who often have multiple comorbidities. Although cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is the standard of care in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings, outcomes remain poor, and approximately half of patients are ineligible for cisplatin where treatment options are severely limited. Recent comprehensive genome sequencing studies have defined the mutational spectra of high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Although there is a high prevalence of potentially actionable genomic alterations, whether these events represent true oncogenic vulnerabilities has yet to be confirmed. Given the demographics and genetics, we propose that bladder cancer represents an ideal model to study the potential of targeted therapy in older patients who are too often unable to receive cisplatin-based therapy and where novel treatment strategies are desperately needed.

AB Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Optimized standard treatment only confers a modest improvement in progression and overall survival, underscoring the pressing need for the development of novel therapies. Our understanding of glioblastoma (a molecularly heterogeneous disorder) has been accelerated in the setting of large scale genomic analyses, lending insight into potential actionable targets. Antiangiogenic therapies have been used in the treatment of glioblastoma, and our understanding of the means to optimize the role of these agents is continuing to evolve. Recently, immunotherapy has garnered increasing attention as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of gliomas. Promising novel approaches are under active development in the treatment of glioblastoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Disclosure of individual results to participants in genomic research is a complex and contentious issue. There are many existing commentaries and opinion pieces on the topic, but little empirical data concerning actual cases describing how individual results have been returned. Thus, the real life risks and benefits of disclosing individual research results to participants are rarely if ever presented as part of this debate.; METHODS: The Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (APGI) is an Australian contribution to the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), that involves prospective sequencing of tumor and normal genomes of study participants with pancreatic cancer in Australia. We present three examples that illustrate different facets of how research results may arise, and how they may be returned to individuals within an ethically defensible and clinically practical framework. This framework includes the necessary elements identified by others including consent, determination of the significance of results and which to return, delineation of the responsibility for communication and the clinical pathway for managing the consequences of returning results.; RESULTS: Of 285 recruited patients, we returned results to a total of 25 with no adverse events to date. These included four that were classified as medically actionable, nine as clinically significant and eight that were returned at the request of the treating clinician. Case studies presented depict instances where research results impacted on cancer susceptibility, current treatment and diagnosis, and illustrate key practical challenges of developing an effective framework.; CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that return of individual results is both feasible and ethically defensible but only within the context of a robust framework that involves a close relationship between researchers and clinicians.

AB UNLABELLED: IMPORTANCE/OBJECTIVE: Although the suicide rate in the U.S. Army has traditionally been below age-gender matched civilian rates, it has climbed steadily since the beginning of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and since 2008 has exceeded the demographically matched civilian rate. The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multicomponent epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce Army suicides and increase knowledge about risk and resilience factors for suicidality and its psychopathological correlates. This paper presents an overview of the Army STARRS component study designs and of recent findings. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTION: Army STARRS includes six main component studies: (1) the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative data systems (including records of suicidal behaviors) for all soldiers on active duty 2004-2009 aimed at finding administrative record predictors of suicides; (2) retrospective case-control studies of fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors (each planned to have n = 150 cases and n = 300 controls); (3) a study of new soldiers (n = 50,765 completed surveys) assessed just before beginning basic combat training (BCT) with self-administered questionnaires (SAQ), neurocognitive tests, and blood samples; (4) a cross-sectional study of approximately 35,000 (completed SAQs) soldiers representative of all other (i.e., exclusive of BCT) active duty soldiers; (5) a pre-post deployment study (with blood samples) of soldiers in brigade combat teams about to deploy to Afghanistan (n = 9,421 completed baseline surveys), with sub-samples assessed again one, three, and nine months after returning from deployment; and (6) a pilot study to follow-up SAQ respondents transitioning to civilian life. Army/DoD administrative data are being linked prospectively to the large-scale survey samples to examine predictors of subsequent suicidality and related mental health outcomes.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures (self-report and administratively recorded) of suicidal behaviors and their psychopathological correlates.; RESULTS: Component study cooperation rates are comparatively high. Sample biases are relatively small. Inefficiencies introduced into parameter estimates by using nonresponse adjustment weights and time-space clustering are small. Initial findings show that the suicide death rate, which rose over 2004-2009, increased for those deployed, those never deployed, and those previously deployed. Analyses of administrative records show that those deployed or previously deployed were at greater suicide risk. Receiving a waiver to enter the Army was not associated with increased risk. However, being demoted in the past two years was associated with increased risk. Time in current deployment, length of time since return from most recent deployment, total number of deployments, and time interval between most recent deployments (known as dwell time) were not associated with suicide risk. Initial analyses of survey data show that 13.9% of currently active non-deployed regular Army soldiers considered suicide at some point in their lifetime, while 5.3% had made a suicide plan, and 2.4% had attempted suicide. Importantly, 47-60% of these outcomes first occurred prior to enlistment. Prior mental disorders, in particular major depression and intermittent explosive disorder, were the strongest predictors of these self-reported suicidal behaviors. Most onsets of plans-attempts among ideators (58.3-63.3%) occurred within the year of onset of ideation. About 25.1% of non-deployed U.S. Army personnel met 30-day criteria for a DSM-IV anxiety, mood, disruptive behavior, or substance disorder (15.0% an internalizing disorder; 18.4% an externalizing disorder) and 11.1% for multiple disorders. Importantly, three-fourths of these disorders had pre-enlistment onsets.; CONCLUSIONS: Integration across component studies creates strengths going well beyond those in conventional applications of the same individual study designs. These design features create a strong methodological foundation from which Army STARRS can pursue its substantive research goals. The early findings reported here illustrate the importance of the study and its approach as a model of studying rare events particularly of national security concern. Continuing analyses of the data will inform suicide prevention for the U.S. Army.

AB Patients in whom the standard of care has failed or who have uncommon tumors for which no standard of care exists are often treated with drugs selected based on the physician's best guess. The rate of success for this method is generally low. With the advent of fast, affordable tumor profiling technologies, and a growth in the understanding of predictive biomarkers, it is now possible to identify drugs potentially associated with clinical benefit for such patients. We present the Caris approach to evidence-based tumor profiling and two patients with advanced ovarian and prostate cancer in whom standard of care had failed and tumor profiling identified an effective treatment schedule. To establish Caris Molecular Intelligence(TM) (CMI), over 120,000 clinical publications were screened and graded to characterize the predictive value of biomarkers that form the panel of tests. CMI includes multiple technologies to measure changes in proteins, ribonucleic acid, and deoxyribonucleic acid and proprietary software that matches the test results with the published evidence. The CMI results enable physicians to select drugs that are more likely to benefit the patients, avoid drugs that are not likely to work, and find treatment options that otherwise would not be considered. Worldwide, over 60,000 cancer patients have undergone evidence-based tumor profiling with CMI. In the cases reported in this article, CMI identified treatments that would not have been routinely used in the respective clinical setting. The clinical outcomes observed help to illustrate the utility of this approach.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence based guidance to researchers and practice personnel about forming and carrying out effective research partnerships.; DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A review of the literature, interviews and discussions with colleagues in both research and practice roles, and a review of the authors' personal experiences as researchers in partnership research.; FINDINGS: Partnership research is, in some respects, a distinct "approach" to research, but there are many different versions. An analysis of research publications and of their research experience led the authors to develop a framework for planning and assessing the partnership research process, which includes defining expected outcomes for the partners, their roles, and steps in the research process.; PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This review and analysis provides guidance that may reduce commonly-reported misunderstandings and help to plan more successful partnerships and projects. It also identifies future research which is needed to define more precisely the questions and purposes for which partnership research is most appropriate, and methods and designs for specific types of partnership research.; ORIGINALITY/VALUE: As more research moves towards increased participation of practitioners and patients in the research process, more precise and differentiated understanding of the different partnership approaches is required, and when each is most suitable. This article describes research approaches that have the potential to reduce "the research-practice gap". It gives evidence- and experience-based guidance for choosing and establishing a partnership research process, so as to improve partnership relationship-building and more actionable research.

AB While the genomics-derived discoveries promise benefits to basic research and health care, the speed and affordability of sequencing following recent technological advances has further aggravated the data deluge. Seamless integration of the ever-increasing clinical, genomic, and experimental data and efficient mining for knowledge extraction, delivering actionable insight and generating testable hypotheses are therefore critical for the needs of biomedical research. For instance, high-throughput techniques are frequently applied to detect disease candidate genes. Experimental validation of these candidates however is both time-consuming and expensive. Hence, several computational approaches based on literature and data mining have been developed to identify the most promising candidates for follow-up studies. Based on "guilt by association" principle, most of these methods use prior knowledge about a disease of interest to discover and rank novel candidate genes. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of recent advances made in literature- and data-mining-based approaches for candidate gene prioritization. As a case study, we focus on a Web-based computational approach that uses integrated heterogeneous data sources including gene-literature associations for ranking disease candidate genes and explain how to run typical queries using this system.

AB Recent technological advances in genomics now allow producing biological data at unprecedented tera- and petabyte scales. Yet, the extraction of useful knowledge from this voluminous data presents a significant challenge to a scientific community. Efficient mining of vast and complex data sets for the needs of biomedical research critically depends on seamless integration of clinical, genomic, and experimental information with prior knowledge about genotype-phenotype relationships accumulated in a plethora of publicly available databases. Furthermore, such experimental data should be accessible to a variety of algorithms and analytical pipelines that drive computational analysis and data mining. Translational projects require sophisticated approaches that coordinate and perform various analytical steps involved in the extraction of useful knowledge from accumulated clinical and experimental data in an orderly semiautomated manner. It presents a number of challenges such as (1) high-throughput data management involving data transfer, data storage, and access control; (2) scalable computational infrastructure; and (3) analysis of large-scale multidimensional data for the extraction of actionable knowledge.We present a scalable computational platform based on crosscutting requirements from multiple scientific groups for data integration, management, and analysis. The goal of this integrated platform is to address the challenges and to support the end-to-end analytical needs of various translational projects.

AB For a decade, the technologies behind DNA sequencing have improved rapidly in cost reduction and speed. Sequencing in large populations of cancer patients is leading to dramatic advances in our understanding of the cancer genome. The wide variety of cancer types sequenced and analyzed using these technologies has revealed many novel fundamental genetic mechanisms driving cancer initiation, progression, and maintenance. We have deepened our understanding of the signaling pathways, demonstrating disruption in epigenetic regulation and destabilization of the splicing machinery. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies are being elucidated for the first time. The translation of genome-scale variation into clinically actionable information is still in its infancy; nevertheless, insights from sequencing studies have led to the discovery of a variety of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Here, we review recent advances in cancer genomics and discuss what the new findings have taught us about cancer biology and, more importantly, how these new findings guide more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.

AB Improved understanding of the multilayer regulation of the human genome has led to a greater appreciation of environmental, nutritional, and epigenetic risk factors for human disease. Chromatin remodeling, histone tail modifications, and DNA methylation are dynamic epigenetic changes responsive to external stimuli. Careful interpretation can provide insights for actionable public health through collaboration between population and basic scientists and through integration of multiple data sources. We review key findings in environmental epigenetics both in human population studies and in animal models, and discuss the implications of these results for risk assessment and public health protection. To ultimately succeed in identifying epigenetic mechanisms leading to complex phenotypes and disease, researchers must integrate the various animal models, human clinical approaches, and human population approaches while paying attention to life-stage sensitivity, to generate effective prescriptions for human health evaluation and disease prevention.

AB Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a heterogeneous set of tumors defined by an absence of actionable therapeutic targets (ER, PR, and HER-2). Microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers represents a novel comparator to reveal insights into TNBC heterogeneity and to inform drug development. Using RNA-sequencing data from our institution and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we compared the transcriptomes of 94 TNBCs, 20 microdissected normal breast tissues from healthy volunteers from the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Tissue Bank, and 10 histologically normal tissues adjacent to tumor. Pathway analysis comparing TNBCs to optimized normal controls of microdissected normal epithelium versus classic controls composed of adjacent normal tissue revealed distinct molecular signatures. Differential gene expression of TNBC compared with normal comparators demonstrated important findings for TNBC-specific clinical trials testing targeted agents; lack of over-expression for negative studies and over-expression in studies with drug activity. Next, by comparing each individual TNBC to the set of microdissected normals, we demonstrate that TNBC heterogeneity is attributable to transcriptional chaos, is associated with non-silent DNA mutational load, and explains transcriptional heterogeneity in addition to known molecular subtypes. Finally, chaos analysis identified 146 core genes dysregulated in >90% of TNBCs revealing an over-expressed central network. In conclusion, use of microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers enables an optimized approach for studying TNBC and uncovers biological heterogeneity mediated by transcriptional chaos.

AB Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers usually display a high level of genomic instability and often carry TP53 mutations. Mutations in EGFR have been reported in about 10% triple-negative tumours from Chinese women, and there is some evidence that triple-negative and basal-like tumours might carry additional mutations against which targeted therapies are available. We, therefore, sought to determine the frequency of 238 targetable mutations in 19 oncogenes (including EGFR) in a panel of basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers from Caucasian women. We used the OncoCarta panel to screen for 238 mutations across 19 common oncogenes in 107 basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers from Caucasian women. Mutations were then verified using Sanger sequencing or primer extension by iPLEX. We identified and validated 10 mutations across five genes. Most of the mutations were observed in the PIK3CA gene (18/107, 16.8%), while mutations in KRAS, NRAS, MET and AKT1 were present in only one tumour each (1/107, 0.9%). Among the missense substitutions in PIK3CA the point mutation resulting in the amino acid change H1047R was the most frequent (8/18, 44%). All mutations were mutually exclusive, apart from one basal-like breast tumour which harboured mutations in both MET (p.T992I) and PIK3CA (p.H1047R). We did not identify any mutations in the EGFR gene. In conclusion, we found that with the exception of mutations in PIK3CA, these actionable oncogenic mutations on the Oncocarta panel are rare in basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers from Caucasian women. Custom panels, designed to detect mutations identified by exome sequencing of basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers, are, therefore, needed to identify women who might be eligible for targeted treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the molecular characterization of tumors, and the availability of new agents to treat non-small-cell lung cancer has increased. Despite these achievements, optimal care of patients with this condition remains less than ideal. Although national quality measures and guideline recommendations provide the necessary framework for patient care, routine self-assessment of adherence to these measures is required for physician practice improvement. To this end, a performance improvement initiative that met national continuing medical education standards was designed.; METHODS: Focusing on non-small-cell lung cancer patient care, oncologists underwent a three-step process that included a self-assessment of predetermined performance measures, the development and implementation of an actionable plan for improvement, and a second round of assessment to measure practice change.; RESULTS: A total of 440 unique patient charts were reviewed by 22 practicing oncologists. Participants demonstrated high baseline performance levels of established quality measures, such as inclusion of the patient's pathology report and assessment of smoking history. Significant gains were observed in the areas of supportive care, including assessment of the patient's emotional well-being and the use of molecular markers in diagnostic and treatment decision making.; CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study support the value of performance improvement initiatives to help increase physician delivery of evidence-based care to patients.

AB The most challenging type of sudden cardiac death is sudden unexplained death. The etiologies for sudden unexplained death are diverse and not necessarily confined to the cardiovascular system. Nevertheless, certain cardiovascular diseases, particularly cardiac channelopathies and cardiomyopathies, are known to play significant roles in sudden deaths. The purpose of the review is to provide autopsy pathologists with an actionable guide through illuminating the clinically relevant molecular basis of cardiac channelopathies and cardiomyopathies, as well as the changing landscape of molecular diagnostics.  © 2013.

AB Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition in the esophagus, with a rising incidence rate among Caucasians, and an established risk factor for the subsequent progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In contrast to the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus, BE is characterized by columnar epithelium that to some extent resembles the mucosa of the lower intestinal tract. The mechanism of intestinalization of the esophagus is still uncertain. For many years, it was postulated that either abnormal differentiation of resident progenitor cells in the esophagus, or transdifferentiation of mature esophageal keratinocytes provoked by reflux-induced genetic alterations, resulted in the BE phenotype. However, more recent studies suggest that indigenous progenitor cells at the gastro-esophageal junction might, under unfavorable conditions such as TP63 loss or an activated inflammatory response, migrate to the esophagus and initiate columnar cell differentiation. In this review, we discuss the competing theories of the origins of BE, as well as the role of developmental signaling pathways such as Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of BE and EAC. Additionally, we provide an overview of the mutational landscapes of BE and EAC, derived from the results of recently published next generation sequencing (NGS) studies. Future research should elucidate whether NGS on endoscopic mucosal biopsies can help in identifying BE patients at highest risk for EAC development, and whether some of the prevalent mutations are "actionable", leading to improvements in current therapeutic strategies for BE and EAC.

AB Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is responsible for over 600,000 deaths annually and remains a significant public health concern. Because of therapeutic advancements over the past two decades, patients with metastatic CRC are living longer with an improved quality of life. This review will highlight recent trial evidence that improves outcomes for patients with metastatic disease. Topics will include the optimal use of first-line combination chemotherapy, bevacizumab in patients with advanced age or comorbidities, maintenance chemotherapy, first-line use of anti-EGFR therapies, first-line cetuximab versus bevacizumab, anti-angiogenic therapies past progression, and management of treatment-refractory disease. Clinical trial evidence will be presented, along with guidance on how to integrate recent evidence into clinical practice. Finally, this review will examine innovative drug development strategies, and will discuss potentially actionable targets identified by molecular testing.

AB Community assessment workshops were developed to gather client experiences of primary health care services in Australia. Primary health care services are particularly concerned with working with disadvantaged populations, for whom traditional client survey methods such as written surveys may not be inclusive and accessible. Service staff at six Australian primary health care services, including two Aboriginal-specific services, invited participants to attend workshops in 2011-2012. Participants were offered transport, childcare and an interpreter, and provided with reimbursement for their time. Ten workshops were run with a total of 65 participants who accessed a variety of services and programmes. A mix of age and gender was achieved. The workshops yielded detailed qualitative data and quantitative rankings for nine service qualities: holistic, effective, efficient, culturally respectful, used by those most in need, responsive to the local community, increasing individual control, supports and empowers the community, and mix of treatment, prevention and promotion. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed for qualitative analysis. The workshop approach succeeded in being (i) inclusive, reaching users from disadvantaged sections of the community; (ii) comprehensive, providing ratings and discussion that took account of the whole service; (iii) richly descriptive, with researchers able to generate detailed feedback; and (iv) more empowering than traditional client survey methods, by allowing more control to participants and greater benefits than surveys of individuals. The community assessment workshops are a method that could be widely applied to health service evaluation research where the goal is to reach disadvantaged communities and provide ratings and detailed analysis of the experience of users. The participants and the research benefited from the group approach, and the workshops provided valuable, actionable information to the health services. Recruitment of users, particularly those from culturally diverse backgrounds, remains one of the key challenges facing evaluators.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The article explores the Freirian theory of social change underpinning health-related community mobilisation in poor and marginalised communities. Highlighting potential shortcomings of its essentialist understandings of power and identity, and linear notions of change, it examines how lessons from the 'new left', and burgeoning global protest movements, can rejuvenate the field given the growing complexity of 21st-century social inequalities. It suggests the need for a pastiche of approaches to accommodate health struggles in different times and places. However, while needing some updating, Freire's profound and actionable understandings of the symbolic and material dimensions of social inequalities remain a powerful starting point for activism.

AB Mutational testing has moved to the forefront as an integral component in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently 3 targeted therapies (erlotinib, afatinib, and crizotinib) are approved by the FDA to treat patients with specific genetic abnormalities in NSCLC. As mutational screening expands to include a greater number of genes, the results will become more difficult to interpret, particularly if mutations are found in multiple genes or genes that are not actionable at the time of testing. This case report summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with NSCLC that harbored multiple potentially targetable driver mutations. It also discusses the current NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for mutational testing in NSCLC and the inherent difficulties with interpreting mutational results when multiple mutations are found in a single gene or across multiple genes.

AB Drug transporters are now universally acknowledged as important determinants of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. Altered transporter function, whether due to genetic polymorphism, DDIs, disease, or environmental factors such as dietary constituents, can result in changes in drug efficacy and/or toxicity due to changes in circulating or tissue levels of either drugs or endogenous substrates.Prediction of whether and to what extent the biological fate of a drug is influenced by drug transporters, therefore, requires in vitro test systems that can accurately predict the risk and magnitude of clinical DDIs. While these in vitro assessments appear simple in theory, practitioners recognize that there are multiple factors that can influence experimental outcomes. A better understanding of these variables, including test compound characteristics, test systems, assay formats, and experimental design will enable clear, actionable steps and translatable outcomes that may avoid unnecessary downstream clinical engagement. This chapter will delineate the role of these variables in improving in vitro assay outcomes.

AB Stratified medicine can reduce the costs of neurological care, bringing benefits to both patients and physicians. The availability of routine genetic testing, new biomarkers and advanced imaging, as well as new technologies for patient-centred data collection, has expanded the potential for patient stratification. Several neurology subspecialities, including stroke, epilepsy and behavioural neurology, have already applied stratification for disease prognosis, optimization of disease management and reduction of treatment-related adverse events. Stratification approaches could improve the cost-effectiveness of neurological care that involves treatments with high costs or risks of adverse reactions, as well as guide the use of emerging, highly individualized therapies. There are still major challenges in the development of clinically actionable stratification concepts, and practical barriers can limit adoption of these concepts into clinical practice. However, improved technologies and disease understanding are making more precise stratification practical. We believe that neurologists should become leaders in the development and validation of these practices, and that use of these approaches should be part of a broader strategy for addressing both the growing needs of an ageing population and the rising pressures for rapid improvements in the cost-effectiveness of therapeutics.

AB Gap analysis encompasses a comprehensive process to identify, understand, address, and bridge gaps in service delivery and nursing practice. onducting gap analysis provides structure to information gathering and the process of finding sustainable solutions to important deficiencies. Nursing leaders need to recognize, measure, monitor, and execute on feasible actionable solutions to help organizations make adjustments to address gaps between what is desired and the actual real-world conditions contributing to the quality chasm in health care. Gap analysis represents a functional and comprehensive tool to address organizational deficiencies. Using gap analysis proactively helps organizations map out and sustain corrective efforts to close the quality chasm. Gaining facility in gap analysis should help the nursing profession's contribution to narrowing the quality chasm.

AB The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently released guidelines regarding the reporting of incidental findings in sequencing data. Given the availability of Direct to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing and the falling cost of whole exome and genome sequencing, individuals will increasingly have the opportunity to analyze their own genomic data. We have developed a web-based tool, PATH-SCAN, which annotates individual genomes and exomes for ClinVar designated pathogenic variants found within the genes from the ACMG guidelines. Because mutations in these genes predispose individuals to conditions with actionable outcomes, our tool will allow individuals or researchers to identify potential risk variants in order to consult physicians or genetic counselors for further evaluation. Moreover, our tool allows individuals to anonymously submit their pathogenic burden, so that we can crowd source the collection of quantitative information regarding the frequency of these variants. We tested our tool on 1092 publicly available genomes from the 1000 Genomes project, 163 genomes from the Personal Genome Project, and 15 genomes from a clinical genome sequencing research project. Excluding the most commonly seen variant in 1000 Genomes, about 20% of all genomes analyzed had a ClinVar designated pathogenic variant that required further evaluation.

AB BACKGROUND: Advances in personalized medicine require the identification of variables that predict differential response to treatments as well as the development and refinement of methods to transform predictive information into actionable recommendations.; OBJECTIVE: To illustrate and test a new method for integrating predictive information to aid in treatment selection, using data from a randomized treatment comparison.; METHOD: Data from a trial of antidepressant medications (N = 104) versus cognitive behavioral therapy (N = 50) for Major Depressive Disorder were used to produce predictions of post-treatment scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) in each of the two treatments for each of the 154 patients. The patient's own data were not used in the models that yielded these predictions. Five pre-randomization variables that predicted differential response (marital status, employment status, life events, comorbid personality disorder, and prior medication trials) were included in regression models, permitting the calculation of each patient's Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), in HRSD units.; RESULTS: For 60% of the sample a clinically meaningful advantage (PAI≥3) was predicted for one of the treatments, relative to the other. When these patients were divided into those randomly assigned to their "Optimal" treatment versus those assigned to their "Non-optimal" treatment, outcomes in the former group were superior (d = 0.58, 95% CI .17-1.01).; CONCLUSIONS: This approach to treatment selection, implemented in the context of two equally effective treatments, yielded effects that, if obtained prospectively, would rival those routinely observed in comparisons of active versus control treatments.

AB Development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by accumulation of mutations in several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We have formerly described the mutation pattern of HNSCC and described NOTCH signaling pathway alterations. Given the complexity of the HNSCC, here we extend the previous study to understand the overall HNSCC mutation context and to discover additional genetic alterations. We performed high depth targeted exon sequencing of 51 highly actionable cancer-related genes with a high frequency of mutation across many cancer types, including head and neck. DNA from primary tumor tissues and matched normal tissues was analyzed for 37 HNSCC patients. We identified 26 non-synonymous or stop-gained mutations targeting 11 of 51 selected genes. These genes were mutated in 17 out of 37 (46%) studied HNSCC patients. Smokers harbored 3.2-fold more mutations than non-smokers. Importantly, TP53 was mutated in 30%, NOTCH1 in 8% and FGFR3 in 5% of HNSCC. HPV negative patients harbored 4-fold more TP53 mutations than HPV positive patients. These data confirm prior reports of the HNSCC mutational profile. Additionally, we detected mutations in two new genes, CEBPA and FES, which have not been previously reported in HNSCC. These data extend the spectrum of HNSCC mutations and define novel mutation targets in HNSCC carcinogenesis, especially for smokers and HNSCC without HPV infection.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient chart review is the gold standard for detection of potential patient hazards (i.e. medication errors or failure to follow up actionable results) in both routine clinical care and patient safety research. However, advanced medical students' ability to read patient charts and to identify patient hazards is rather poor. We therefore investigated whether it is possible to teach advanced medical students how to identify patient hazards independent of context (i.e. cancer versus cardiac failure) in patient charts.; METHODS: All fifth-year medical students in one semester (n = 123) were randomized into two groups. One group (IC) received a patient chart review-training first and then a control-intervention and the other group (CI) received the control-intervention first and then the patient chart review-training. Before and after the teaching sessions, students reviewed different scenarios with standardized fictional patient charts containing 12 common patient hazards. Two blinded raters rated the students' notes for any patient hazard addressed in the notes using a checklist. The students were blinded to the study question and design. There was no external funding and no harm for the participating students.; RESULTS: A total of 35 data sets had to be excluded because of missing data. Overall, the students identified 17% (IQR 8-29%) of the patient hazards before the training and 56% (IQR 41-66%) of the patient hazards after the training. At the second assessment students identified more patient hazards than at the first. They identified even more in the third. The effect was most pronounced after the patient chart review training (all p<.01).; CONCLUSION: Patient chart review exercises and problem-based patient chart review training improve students' abilities to recognize patient hazards independent of context during patient chart review.

AB As the cost of whole genome sequencing (WGS) decreases, clinical laboratories will be looking at broadly adopting this technology to screen for variants of clinical significance. To fully leverage this technology in a clinical setting, results need to be reported quickly, as the turnaround rate could potentially impact patient care. The latest sequencers can sequence a whole human genome in about 24 hours. However, depending on the computing infrastructure available, the processing of data can take several days, with the majority of computing time devoted to aligning reads to genomics regions that are to date not clinically interpretable. In an attempt to accelerate the reporting of clinically actionable variants, we have investigated the utility of a multi-step alignment algorithm focused on aligning reads and calling variants in genomic regions of clinical relevance prior to processing the remaining reads on the whole genome. This iterative workflow significantly accelerates the reporting of clinically actionable variants with no loss of accuracy when compared to genotypes obtained with the OMNI SNP platform or to variants detected with a standard workflow that combines Novoalign and GATK.

AB This study, a collaboration between an academic research center and Washington State's health, employment, and correction departments, investigates the extent to which treatment engagement, a widely adopted performance measure, is associated with employment, an important outcome for individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorders. Two-stage Heckman probit regressions were conducted using 2008 administrative data for 7,570 adults receiving publicly funded treatment. The first stage predicted employment in the year following the first treatment visit, and three separate second-stage models predicted the number of quarters employed, wages, and hours worked. Engagement as a main effect was not significant for any of the employment outcomes. However, for clients with prior criminal justice involvement, engagement was associated with both employment and higher wages following treatment. Clients with criminal justice involvement face greater challenge regarding employment, so the identification of any actionable step which increases the likelihood of employment or wages is an important result.

AB Recent years have seen development and implementation of anticancer therapies targeted to particular gene mutations, but methods to assay clinical cancer specimens in a comprehensive way for the critical mutations remain underdeveloped. We have developed UW-OncoPlex, a clinical molecular diagnostic assay to provide simultaneous deep-sequencing information, based on >500* average coverage, for all classes of mutations in 194 clinically relevant genes. To validate UW-OncoPlex, we tested 98 previously characterized clinical tumor specimens from 10 different cancer types, including 41 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Mixing studies indicated reliable mutation detection in samples with ≥ 10% tumor cells. In clinical samples with ≥ 10% tumor cells, UW-OncoPlex correctly identified 129 of 130 known mutations [sensitivity 99.2%, (95% CI, 95.8%-99.9%)], including single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, internal tandem duplications, gene copy number gains and amplifications, gene copy losses, chromosomal gains and losses, and actionable genomic rearrangements, including ALK-EML4, ROS1, PML-RARA, and BCR-ABL. In the same samples, the assay also identified actionable point mutations in genes not previously analyzed and novel gene rearrangements of MLL and GRIK4 in melanoma, and of ASXL1, PIK3R1, and SGCZ in acute myeloid leukemia. To best guide existing and emerging treatment regimens and facilitate integration of genomic testing with patient care, we developed a framework for data analysis, decision support, and reporting clinically actionable results.

AB Currently, oncology testing includes molecular studies and cytogenetic analysis to detect genetic aberrations of clinical significance. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows rapid analysis of multiple genes for clinically actionable somatic variants. The WUCaMP assay uses targeted capture for NGS analysis of 25 cancer-associated genes to detect mutations at actionable loci. We present clinical validation of the assay and a detailed framework for design and validation of similar clinical assays. Deep sequencing of 78 tumor specimens (≥ 1000* average unique coverage across the capture region) achieved high sensitivity for detecting somatic variants at low allele fraction (AF). Validation revealed sensitivities and specificities of 100% for detection of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within coding regions, compared with SNP array sequence data (95% CI = 83.4-100.0 for sensitivity and 94.2-100.0 for specificity) or whole-genome sequencing (95% CI = 89.1-100.0 for sensitivity and 99.9-100.0 for specificity) of HapMap samples. Sensitivity for detecting variants at an observed 10% AF was 100% (95% CI = 93.2-100.0) in HapMap mixes. Analysis of 15 masked specimens harboring clinically reported variants yielded concordant calls for 13/13 variants at AF of ≥ 15%. The WUCaMP assay is a robust and sensitive method to detect somatic variants of clinical significance in molecular oncology laboratories, with reduced time and cost of genetic analysis allowing for strategic patient management.

AB The promise of precision medicine for cancer is already being realized with the recent introduction of many targeted therapies, some with companion diagnostic tests that identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment. The utility of molecular profiling of cancer to identify actionable aberrations has been suggested by several small clinical trials conducted in patients with advanced cancer and by many anecdotes but is yet to be proven in well-designed, prospective, randomized trials. Several trials that will definitively test this strategy are now underway or soon to be launched. Melanoma, a disease once largely untreatable when metastatic, may be a paradigm for understanding how the molecular drivers of a disease can lead to highly effective targeted therapies, as well as for realizing the enormous therapeutic potential of unleashing the immune system against cancer to produce long-term disease control. Looking to the future, advanced omics technologies and computational techniques will enable assessment of not only genomic variants, as performed today, but also of pathway and network aberrations that will greatly facilitate selection of drug combinations likely to benefit specific patients. As our deepening understanding of tumor biology converges with rapid advances in measurement science and technology and computational analysis, we have an enormous opportunity to create a future for precision medicine in oncology that provides for highly specific, minimally toxic, and dramatically effective treatment for each patient.

AB Lung cancer accounts for a quarter of all cancer deaths. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently segregated by the presence of actionable driver oncogenes. This review will provide an overview of molecular subsets of lung cancer, including descriptions of the defining oncogenes (EGFR, ALK, KRAS, ROS1, RET, BRAF, ERBB2, NTRK1, FGFR, among others) and how these predict for response to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are either clinically available or in clinical trial development for advanced NSCLC. Particular focus will be placed on subsets with EGFR mutated and ALK rearranged NSCLC. Somatic TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations (such as exon 19 deletions and L858R substitutions) are the most robust predictive biomarker for symptom improvement, radiographic response, and increment in progression-free survival (PFS) when EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) are used for patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the palliative benefits that EGFR TKIs afford are limited by multiple biologic mechanisms of tumor adaptation/resistance (such as the EGFR-T790M mutation and oncogene bypass tracks), and future efforts toward delaying, preventing, and treating resistance are underway. Similar to EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements exemplify an oncogene-driven NSCLC that can be effectively palliated with a precision TKI therapy (the multitargeted ALK/MET/ROS1 TKI crizotinib). When resistance to first-line crizotinib therapy occurs, multiple second generation ALK TKIs have demonstrated impressive rates of disease control in clinical trials, and these may modify long-term outcomes for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The development of TKIs for other oncogene-driven NSCLCs may expand the portfolio of precision therapies for this recalcitrant cancer.

AB With the vast amount of immunological data available, immunology research is entering the big data era. These data vary in granularity, quality, and complexity and are stored in various formats, including publications, technical reports, and databases. The challenge is to make the transition from data to actionable knowledge and wisdom and bridge the knowledge gap and application gap. We report a knowledge-based approach based on a framework called KB-builder that facilitates data mining by enabling fast development and deployment of web-accessible immunological data knowledge warehouses. Immunological knowledge discovery relies heavily on both the availability of accurate, up-to-date, and well-organized data and the proper analytics tools. We propose the use of knowledge-based approaches by developing knowledgebases combining well-annotated data with specialized analytical tools and integrating them into analytical workflow. A set of well-defined workflow types with rich summarization and visualization capacity facilitates the transformation from data to critical information and knowledge. By using KB-builder, we enabled streamlining of normally time-consuming processes of database development. The knowledgebases built using KB-builder will speed up rational vaccine design by providing accurate and well-annotated data coupled with tailored computational analysis tools and workflow.

AB BACKGROUND: The nursing profession is exploring how academic-practice partnerships should be structured to maximize the potential benefits for each partner. As part of an evaluation of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Nursing Academy (VANA) program, we sought to identify indicators of successful partnerships during the crucial first year.; METHODS: We conducted a qualitative analysis of 142 individual interviews and 23 focus groups with stakeholders from 15 partnerships across the nation. Interview respondents typically included the nursing school Dean, the VA chief nurse, both VANA Program Directors (VA-based and nursing school-based), and select VANA faculty members. The focus groups included a total of 222 VANA students and the nursing unit managers and staff from units where VANA students were placed. An ethnographic approach was utilized to identify emergent themes from these data that underscored indicators of and influences on Launch Year achievement.; RESULTS: We emphasize five key themes: the criticality of inter-organizational collaboration; challenges arising from blending different cultures; challenges associated with recruiting nurses to take on faculty roles; the importance of structuring the partnership to promote evidence-based practice and simulation-based learning in the clinical setting; and recognizing that stable relationships must be based on long-term commitments rather than short-term changes in the demand for nursing care.; CONCLUSIONS: Developing an academic-clinical partnership requires identifying how organizations with different leadership and management structures, different responsibilities, goals and priorities, different cultures, and different financial models and accountability systems can bridge these differences to develop joint programs integrating activities across the organizations. The experience of the VANA sites in implementing academic-clinical partnerships provides a broad set of experiences from which to learn about how such partnerships can be effectively implemented, the barriers and challenges that will be encountered, and strategies and factors to overcome challenges and build an effective, sustainable partnership. This framework provides actionable guidelines for structuring and implementing effective academic-practice partnerships that support undergraduate nursing education.

AB Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) is a very serious condition that occurs when the ventricles are driven at high rates. The abnormal excitation pathways make ventricular contraction less synchronous resulting in less effective filling and emptying of the left ventricles. However, almost half of the V-tach alarms declared through processing of patterns observed in electrocardiography are not clinically actionable. The focus of this study is to provide guidance on determining whether a technically-correct V-tach alarm is clinically-actionable by determining its "hemodynamic impact". A supervisory learning approach based on conditional inference trees to determine the hemodynamic impact of a V-tach alarm based on extracted features is described. According to preliminary results on a subset of Multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II (MIMIC-II) database, true positive rate of more than 90% can be achieved.

AB In many critical care units, default patient monitor alarm settings are not fine-tuned to the vital signs of the patient population. As a consequence there are many alarms. A large fraction of the alarms are not clinically actionable, thus contributing to alarm fatigue. Recent attention to this phenomenon has resulted in attempts in many institutions to decrease the overall alarm load of clinicians by altering the trigger thresholds for monitored parameters. Typically, new alarm settings are defined based on clinical knowledge and patient population norms and tried empirically on new patients without quantitative knowledge about the potential impact of these new settings. We introduce alarm regeneration as a method to estimate the alarm rate of new alarm settings using recorded patient monitor data. This method enables evaluation of several alarm setting scenarios prior to using these settings in the clinical setting. An expression for the alarm rate variance is derived for the calculation of statistical confidence intervals on the results.

AB The past decade has seen notable progress in confronting the HIV epidemic. By the end of 2013, almost 13 million persons living with HIV had access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In addition, progress has also been achieved in terms of HIV prevention with 26 LMIC achieving a 50% decrease in number of new infections including 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. New research findings also offer new efficacious prevention interventions that offer new opportunities for further mitigation of new HIV infections. Such progress has inspired ambitious pronouncements such as achieving "The End of AIDS" or "An AIDS Free Generation." This progress has also motivated the development of new guidelines aimed to achieving these goals. Implementation of guideline recommendations, however, requires translation of these guidelines into actionable steps and then their successful delivery within established health services. The opportunities offered by new guidelines frequently meet the realities of the frailties of the health system. Achieving current ambitious global targets must confront the specific deficits in the health system that inhibit access and acceptability of programmes as well as hinder achievement of high quality or desired coverage.

AB BACKGROUND: Twitter is a social network where users read, send, and share snippets of text ("tweets"). Tweets can be disseminated through multiple means; on desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices, over ethernet, Wi-Fi or cellular networks. This redundancy positions Twitter as a useful tool for disseminating information to the public during emergencies or disasters. Previous research on dissemination of information using Twitter has mostly investigated the characteristics of tweets that are most effective in raising consumer awareness about a new product or event. In particular, they describe characteristics that increase the chance the messages will be shared ("retweeted") by users. In comparison, little has been published on how information from municipal or state government agencies spreads on Twitter during emergency situations. Retweeting these messages is a way to enhance public awareness of potentially important instructions from public officials in a disaster.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to (1) describe the tweets of select New York State and New York City agencies by public officials surrounding two notable recent winter storms that required a large-scale emergency response, and (2) identify the characteristics of the tweets of public officials that were most disseminated (retweeted).; METHODS: For one week surrounding Superstorm Sandy (October 2012) and the winter blizzard Nemo (February 2013), we collected (1) tweets from the official accounts for six New York governmental agencies, and (2) all tweets containing the hashtags #sandy (or #nemo) and #nyc. From these data we calculated how many times a tweet was retweeted, controlling for differences in baseline activity in each account. We observed how many hashtags and links each tweet contained. We also calculated the lexical diversity of each tweet, a measure of the range of vocabulary used.; RESULTS: During the Sandy storm, 3242 shared (retweeted) messages from public officials were collected. The lexical diversity of official tweets was similar (2.25-2.49) and well below the average for non-official tweets mentioning #sandy and #nyc (3.82). Most official tweets were with substantial retweets including a link for further reading. Of the 448 tweets analyzed from six official city and state Twitter accounts from the Nemo blizzard, 271 were related to the storm, and 174 had actionable information for the public. Actionable storm messages were retweeted approximately 24x per message, compared to 31x per message for general storm information.; CONCLUSIONS: During two weather emergencies, New York public officials were able to convey storm-related information that was shared widely beyond existing follower bases, potentially improving situational awareness and disaster response. Official Sandy tweets, characterized by a lower lexical diversity score than other city- and Sandy-related tweets, were likely easier to understand, and often linked to further information and resources. Actionable information in the Nemo blizzard, such as specific instructions and cancellation notices, was not shared as often as more general warnings and "fun facts," suggesting agencies mix important instructions with more general news and trivia, as a way of reaching the broadest audience during a disaster.

AB Biobanks should return clinically significant and actionable research findings to donors who have given physical material to the biobank. Because the clinical significance of a research finding is hard to determine for the individual donor, a procedure to decide on clinical significance should be incorporated into a structure for the actual feedback of research results. Most published studies show that donors expect return of individual research results, but there is almost no experience with it. Explorative questionnaire-based research among Dutch biobanks from the BioBanking Medical Research Infrastructure (BBMRI.NL) shows that a substantial group of biobanks can return individual research findings from data analysis. On the basis of these experiences a return of results policy may be drafted that answers to the interests of donors and the possibilities of biobanks.

AB BACKGROUND: Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT) are small round blue cell tumors driven by an N-terminal containing EWS translocation. Very few somatic mutations have been reported in ES, and none have been identified in DSRCT. The aim of this study is to explore potential actionable mutations in ES and DSRCT.; METHODOLOGY: Twenty eight patients with ES or DSRCT had tumor tissue available that could be analyzed by one of the following methods: 1) Next-generation exome sequencing platform; 2) Multiplex PCR/Mass Spectroscopy; 3) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based single- gene mutation screening; 4) Sanger sequencing; 5) Morphoproteomics.; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Novel somatic mutations were identified in four out of 18 patients with advanced ES and two of 10 patients with advanced DSRCT (six out of 28 (21.4%));KRAS (n = 1), PTPRD (n = 1), GRB10 (n = 2), MET (n = 2) and PIK3CA (n = 1). One patient with both PTPRD and GRB10 mutations and one with a GRB10 mutation achieved a complete remission (CR) on an Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor based treatment. One patient, who achieved a partial remission (PR) with IGF1R inhibitor treatment, but later developed resistance, demonstrated a KRAS mutation in the post-treatment resistant tumor, but not in the pre-treatment tumor suggesting that the RAF/RAS/MEK pathway was activated with progression.; CONCLUSIONS: We have reported several different mutations in advanced ES and DSRCT that have direct implications for molecularly-directed targeted therapy. Our technology agnostic approach provides an initial mutational roadmap used in the path towards individualized combination therapy.

AB Knowledge is considered actionable if users can take direct actions based on such knowledge to their advantage. Among the most important and distinctive actionable knowledge are actionable behavioral rules that can directly and explicitly suggest specific actions to take to influence (restrain or encourage) the behavior in the users' best interest. However, in mining such rules, it often occurs that different rules may suggest the same actions with different expected utilities, which we call conflicting rules. To resolve the conflicts, a previous valid method was proposed. However, inconsistency of the measure for rule evaluating may hinder its performance. To overcome this problem, we develop a new method that utilizes rule ranking procedure as the basis for selecting the rule with the highest utility prediction accuracy. More specifically, we propose an integrative measure, which combines the measures of the support and antecedent length, to evaluate the utility prediction accuracies of conflicting rules. We also introduce a tunable weight parameter to allow the flexibility of integration. We conduct several experiments to test our proposed approach and evaluate the sensitivity of the weight parameter. Empirical results indicate that our approach outperforms those from previous research.

AB In prostate cancer, multiple metastases from the same patient share similar copy number, mutational status, erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) rearrangements, and methylation patterns supporting their clonal origins. Whether actionable targets such as tyrosine kinases are also similarly expressed and activated in anatomically distinct metastatic lesions of the same patient is not known. We evaluated active kinases using phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify druggable targets in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer obtained at rapid autopsy. We identified distinct phosphopeptide patterns in metastatic tissues compared with treatment-naive primary prostate tissue and prostate cancer cell line-derived xenografts. Evaluation of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples for tyrosine phosphorylation and upstream kinase targets revealed SRC, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), rearranged during transfection (RET), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and MAPK1/3 and other activities while exhibiting intrapatient similarity and interpatient heterogeneity. Phosphoproteomic analyses and identification of kinase activation states in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients have allowed for the prioritization of kinases for further clinical evaluation.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic research by decreasing the cost of sequencing while increasing the throughput. The focus now is on potential clinical applications of NGS technology for diagnostics and therapeutics. Clinical applications of NGS in cancer can detect clinically actionable genetic/genomic alterations that are critical for cancer care. These alterations can be of diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic significance. In certain cancers, patient risk and prognosis can be predicted based on the mutation profile identified by NGS. Many targeted therapies have been developed for cancer patients who bear specific mutations; however, choosing the right NGS technique for the appropriate clinical application can be challenging, especially in clinical oncology, where the material for NGS tests is often limited and the turnaround time (TAT) for cancer tests is constrained to a few days. Currently, amplicon-based NGS approaches have emerged as the best fit for clinical oncology. In this review, we focus on amplicon-based library preparation, sequencing, sequence data alignment and annotation, and post-analytic interpretation and reporting.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB In cancer medicine, next generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a practical method to generate patient- and tumor-specific genetic data for optimal selection of targeted therapies. Targeted sequencing allows clinical testing to focus on cancer-related genes, thus maximizing the test's sensitivity and specificity for actionable variants. In this review, we summarize the current regulatory environment surrounding clinical NGS, including regulations and professional opinions established by the College of American Pathologists, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the Association for Molecular Pathology, the New York State Department of Health, and the American College of Medical Genetics. We outline practical considerations for the design of targeted NGS assays, with an emphasis on capture-based methods. Finally, we discuss components of the validation process for clinical NGS assays as well as challenges that still remain for clinical NGS.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The traditional drug development process in breast cancer based on large phase III studies has serious limitations and needs a major overhaul. Searching for new approaches, the testing of novel agents in the preoperative (neoadjuvant) setting approach offers a potentially rapid and efficient strategy for drug development utilizing pathologic complete response (path CR), a surrogate marker for survival, as the primary endpoint. In addition, neoadjuvant studies allow the assessment of drug effects on the target (pharmacodynamic response) and the development of predictive biomarkers of response. Molecular profiling of the residual tumor in the surgical specimen may also provide insights into actionable mechanisms of resistance. Recognizing the potential of neoadjuvant trials for drug development, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced consideration of neoadjuvant trials for accelerated drug approval in early breast cancer, particularly for tumors with high risk of recurrence and unfavorable prognosis, and provided accelerated approval to neoadjuvant pertuzumab in September 2013. The FDA has emphasized that while improvement in path CR could be utilized for "accelerated" approval, improvement in survival will still need to be demonstrated for "regular" approval. Key considerations in conduct of such neoadjuvant drug development trials include (i) study design such as utilization of biomarker stratified design to evaluate a biomarker that could enrich response, (ii) definition of path CR, (iii) distribution of factors that influence path CR between the treatment arms, (iv) prespecified plan for follow-up to obtain data on survival, and (v) safety as it involves a patient population with curable disease. In the years to come, we anticipate an increase in the number of neoadjuvant trials testing novel therapies that hopefully will open a new path in bringing efficacious new therapies to patients with breast cancer. ©2013 AACR.

AB Rankings are a popular and universal approach to structuring otherwise unorganized collections of items by computing a rank for each item based on the value of one or more of its attributes. This allows us, for example, to prioritize tasks or to evaluate the performance of products relative to each other. While the visualization of a ranking itself is straightforward, its interpretation is not, because the rank of an item represents only a summary of a potentially complicated relationship between its attributes and those of the other items. It is also common that alternative rankings exist which need to be compared and analyzed to gain insight into how multiple heterogeneous attributes affect the rankings. Advanced visual exploration tools are needed to make this process efficient. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for the visualization of multi-attribute rankings. Based on these considerations, we propose LineUp--a novel and scalable visualization technique that uses bar charts. This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time.

AB The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase basic knowledge about the determinants of suicidality. This report presents an overview of the designs of the six components of the Army STARRS. These include: an integrated analysis of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) designed to provide data on significant administrative predictors of suicides among the more than 1.6 million soldiers on active duty in 2004-2009; retrospective case-control studies of suicide attempts and fatalities; separate large-scale cross-sectional studies of new soldiers (i.e. those just beginning Basic Combat Training [BCT], who completed self-administered questionnaires [SAQs] and neurocognitive tests and provided blood samples) and soldiers exclusive of those in BCT (who completed SAQs); a pre-post deployment study of soldiers in three Brigade Combat Teams about to deploy to Afghanistan (who completed SAQs and provided blood samples) followed multiple times after returning from deployment; and a platform for following up Army STARRS participants who have returned to civilian life. Department of Defense/Army administrative data records are linked with SAQ data to examine prospective associations between self-reports and subsequent suicidality. The presentation closes with a discussion of the methodological advantages of cross-component coordination. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study of unprecedented size and complexity designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase basic knowledge about determinants of suicidality by carrying out coordinated component studies. A number of major logistical challenges were faced in implementing these studies. The current report presents an overview of the approaches taken to meet these challenges, with a special focus on the field procedures used to implement the component studies. As detailed in the paper, these challenges were addressed at the onset of the initiative by establishing an Executive Committee, a Data Coordination Center (the Survey Research Center [SRC] at the University of Michigan), and study-specific design and analysis teams that worked with staff on instrumentation and field procedures. SRC staff, in turn, worked with the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army (ODUSA) and local Army Points of Contact (POCs) to address logistical issues and facilitate data collection. These structures, coupled with careful fieldworker training, supervision, and piloting, contributed to the major Army STARRS data collection efforts having higher response rates than previous large-scale studies of comparable military samples.

AB The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase knowledge about determinants of suicidality. Three Army STARRS component studies are large-scale surveys: one of new soldiers prior to beginning Basic Combat Training (BCT; n=50,765 completed self-administered questionnaires); another of other soldiers exclusive of those in BCT (n=35,372); and a third of three Brigade Combat Teams about to deploy to Afghanistan who are being followed multiple times after returning from deployment (n=9421). Although the response rates in these surveys are quite good (72.0-90.8%), questions can be raised about sample biases in estimating prevalence of mental disorders and suicidality, the main outcomes of the surveys based on evidence that people in the general population with mental disorders are under-represented in community surveys. This paper presents the results of analyses designed to determine whether such bias exists in the Army STARRS surveys and, if so, to develop weights to correct for these biases. Data are also presented on sample inefficiencies introduced by weighting and sample clustering and on analyses of the trade-off between bias and efficiency in weight trimming.

AB Organisations and members of the public are becoming accustomed to the increasing velocity, frequency and variety of cyber-attacks that they have been facing over the last few years. In response to this challenge, it is important to explore what can be done to offer commercial and private users a reliable and functioning environment. This paper discusses how cyber threats might evolve in the future and seeks to explore these threats more fully. Attention is paid to the changing nature of cyber-attackers and their motivations and what this means for organisations. Finally, useful and actionable steps are provided, which practitioners can use to understand how they can start to address the future challenges of cyber security.

AB IFT's Traceability Improvement Initiative aims to advance work in the area of food product tracing through several means including hosted events where thought leaders exchange knowledge and ideas. In August 2011, the Initiative, in collaboration with GS1 US, convened a group of 50 product tracing stakeholders, as a follow-on to a successful event the month prior. Representatives conducting pilots or implementation studies in produce, seafood, dairy, and other industries discussed the objectives, challenges and learnings. Some of the learnings from on-going initiatives included the sense that better information management provides a return of investment; data often exist but may not necessarily be appropriately linked through the supply chain; and enhanced product tracing enables better accountability and quality control. Challenges identified in enabling traceability throughout the supply chain were the distribution complexity; the need for training, communication, and collaboration; improving the reliability, quality and security of data captured, stored and shared as well as the importance of standards in data and interoperability of technology. Several approaches to overcoming these challenges were discussed. The first approach incrementally improves upon the current "one up/one down" system by requiring electronic records and tracking internal as well as external critical tracking events. The benefits of this approach are its similarity to existing regulatory requirements and low cost of implementation; resulting in a higher probability of adoption. The major disadvantage to this process is the longer response time required during a trace (back or forward). The second approach is similar to a "pedigree" approach where historical information about the food travels with it through the value chain. A major advantage of this approach is the quickest response time during a trace. Some of the disadvantages of this approach are potential for misuse of data, the volume of data required to be maintained at value chain end points, and data privacy concerns. The third approach requires individual nodes within the value chain to maintain electronic records for its own data and make them available for querying during a traceback for outbreak investigation. The major advantage of this approach is the protection of confidential information and the potential for quicker access during a trace. However, the primary disadvantage of this approach is the need for greater computational power and a more complex mechanism to linking the value chain through the data. As next steps, a subgroup will work on clarifying the approach to meeting the goals of traceability, better defining critical tracking events, and articulating the strategy and return on investment from a regulatory and industry perspective. This will result in improved alignment of on-going traceability pilots and initiatives as well as a more actionable guidance document for public review.  © 2012 Institute of Food Technologists

AB The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Total Worker Health Program defines essential elements of an integrated health protection and health promotion model to improve the health, safety, and performance of employers and employees. The lack of a clear strategy to address the core drivers of poor health, excessive medical costs, and lost productivity has deterred a comprehensive, integrated, and proactive approach to meet these challenges. The Employer Health and Productivity Roadmap, comprising six interrelated and integrated core elements, creates a framework of shared accountability for both employers and their health and productivity partners to implement and monitor actionable measures that improve health, maximize productivity, and reduce excessive costs. The strategy is most effective when linked to a financially incentivized health management program or consumer-directed health plan insurance benefit design.

AB As acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient response to cytarabine-based standard-of-care treatment is variable, stratification into subgroups by biomarker-predicted response may lead to improved clinical outcomes. Here, we assess cell mitochondrial depolarization to proapoptotic signaling BH3-only peptides as a surrogate for the function of Bcl-2 family proteins to address clinical response to cytarabine-based therapy in patients with AML (N = 62). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or bone marrow aspirate specimens were obtained from newly diagnosed patients with AML, viably preserved, and assayed by flow cytometry following BH3 profile assay with individual BH3 peptides. Mann-Whitney analysis indicates biomarker correlation with response to induction therapy: Notably, BIM priming was highly significant (P = 2 * 10(-6)) with a compelling sensitivity/specificity profile [area under curve (AUC) = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.94; P = 2 * 10(-10)]. Multivariate analysis indicates improved profiles for BIM readout + patient age (AUC = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97) and BIM + patient age + cytogenetic status (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.98). When patients were stratified by cytogenetic status, BIM readout was significant for both intermediate (P = 0.0017; AUC = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.04) and unfavorable (P = 0.023; AUC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00) risk groups, demonstrating predictive power independent of cytogenetics. Additional analyses of secondary clinical endpoints displayed correlation between overall survival (P = 0.037) and event-free survival (P = 0.044) when patients were stratified into tertiles by BIM peptide response. Taken together, these results highlight the potential utility of BH3 profiling in personalized diagnostics of AML by offering actionable information for patient management decisions. ©2013 AACR.

AB "Comparative effectiveness research" (CER) is not a new concept; however, recently it has been popularized as a method to develop scientifically sound actionable data by which patients, physicians, payers, and policymakers may make informed health care decisions. Fundamental to CER is that the comparative data are derived from large diverse populations of patients assembled from point-of-care general primary care practices and that measured outcomes include patient value judgments. The challenge is to obtain scientifically valid data to be acted upon by decision-making stakeholders with potentially quite diversely different agenda. The process requires very thoughtful research designs modulated by complex statistical and analytic methods. This article is composed of a guiding narrative with an extensive set of tables outlining many of the details required in performing and understanding CER. It ends with short discussions of three example papers, limitations of the method, and how a practicing physician may view such reports.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe a systematic assessment of patient educational materials for the Growing Right Onto Wellness (GROW) trial, a childhood obesity prevention study targeting a low health literate population.; METHODS: Process included: (1) expert review of educational content, (2) assessment of the quality of materials including use of the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) tool, and (3) material review and revision with target population.; RESULTS: 12 core modules were developed and assessed in an iterative process. Average readability was at the 6th grade reading level (SMOG Index 5.63 ± 0.76, and Fry graph 6.0 ± 0.85). SAM evaluation resulted in adjustments to literacy demand, layout & typography, and learning stimulation & motivation. Cognitive interviews with target population revealed additional changes incorporated to enhance participant's perception of acceptability and feasibility for behavior change.; CONCLUSION: The GROW modules are a collection of evidence-based materials appropriate for parents with low health literacy and their preschool aged children, that target the prevention of childhood overweight/obesity.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Most trials addressing the treatment or prevention of childhood obesity use written materials. Due to the ubiquitous prevalence of limited health literacy, our described methods may assist researchers in ensuring their content is both understood and actionable.

AB The family history has been called the first genetic test; it was a core element of primary care long before the current wave of genetics technologies and services became clinically relevant. Risk assessment based on family history allows providers to personalize and prioritize health messages, shifts the focus of health care from treatment to prevention, and can empower individuals and families to be stewards of their own health. In a world of rising health care costs, the family history is an important tool, with its primary cost being the clinician's time. However, a recent National Institutes of Health conference highlighted the lack of substantive evidence to support the clinical utility of family histories. Annual collection of a comprehensive 3-generation family history has been held up as the gold standard for practice. However, interval family histories targeted to symptoms and family histories tailored to a child's life stage (ie, age-based health) may be important and underappreciated methods of collecting family history that yield clinically actionable data and supplement existing family history information. In this article, we review the various applications, as well as capabilities and limitations, of the family history for primary care providers.

AB Targeted therapy in lung adenocarcinoma has evolved rapidly over the last few years, especially in the application of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although many patients with advanced EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma do benefit from treatment with a specific TKI, the duration of disease control is notoriously short. Different patterns of disease progression have been recognized that may require distinct treatment approaches. Isolated progressive disease in the central nervous system requires additional local therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) and an exploratory pulsatile regimen of TKI. Oligoprogressive disease at extracranial sites, representing resistant tumor clones in isolated lesions, requires local ablative therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) and continuation of the existing TKI. Multifocal progressive disease is a key therapeutic challenge to overcome because of widespread acquired resistance due to heterogeneous mechanisms. It is now known that EGFR TKI-acquired resistance is mostly (50-60%) due to a single resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) and occasionally (5-10%) due to c-MET amplification. On the contrary, the acquired resistance mechanisms to ALK TKI appear more diverse. Specific therapeutic strategies are being developed to overcome various acquired resistance mechanisms and may further improve the overall prognosis of advanced lung adenocarcinoma with actionable driver mutations.

AB There is a need to evaluate the evidence about the health effects of tea flavonoids and to provide valid, specific, and actionable tea consumption information to consumers. Emerging evidence suggests that the flavonoids in tea may be associated with beneficial health outcomes, whereas the benefits and risks of tea extracts and supplements are less well known. The next steps in developing tea science should include a focus on the most promising leads, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, rather than pursuing smaller, more diffuse studies of many different health outcomes. Future tea research should also include the use of common reference standards, better characterization of intervention products, and application of batteries of biomarkers of intakes and outcomes across studies, which will allow a common body of evidence to be developed. Mechanistic studies should determine which tea bioactive constituents have effects, whether they act alone or in combination, and how they influence health. Clinical studies should use well-characterized test products, better descriptions of baseline diets, and validated biomarkers of intake and disease risk reduction. There should be more attention to careful safety monitoring and adverse event reporting. Epidemiologic investigations should be of sufficient size and duration to detect small effects, involve populations most likely to benefit, use more complete tea exposure assessment, and include both intermediary markers of risk as well as morbidity and mortality outcomes. The construction of a strong foundation of scientific evidence on tea and health outcomes is essential for developing more specific and actionable messages on tea for consumers.

AB BACKGROUND: Dentists in the US see an increasing number of patients with systemic conditions. These patients are challenging to care for when the relationship between oral and systemic disease is not well understood. The prevalence of professional isolation exacerbates the problem due to the difficulty in finding expert advice or peer support. This study aims to identify whether dentists discuss the oral-systemic connection and what aspects they discuss; to understand their perceptions of and attitudes toward the connection; and to determine what information they need to treat patients with systemic conditions.; METHODS: We retrieved 14,576 messages posted to the Internet Dental Forum from April 2008 to May 2009. Using natural language processing and human classification, we identified substantive phrases and keywords and used them to retrieve 141messages on the oral-systemic connection. We then conducted coding and thematic analysis to identify recurring themes on the topic.; RESULTS: Dentists discuss a variety of topics on oral diseases and systemic health, with the association between periodontal and systemic diseases, the effect of dental materials or procedures on general health, and the impact of oral-systemic connection on practice behaviors as the leading topics. They also disseminate and share research findings on oral and systemic health with colleagues online. However, dentists are very cautious about the nature of the oral-systemic linkage that may not be causal. Nonetheless, they embrace the positive association as a motivating point for patients in practice. When treating patients with systemic conditions, dentists enquire about the cause of less common dental diseases potentially in relation to medical conditions in one-third of the cases and in half of the cases seek clinical guidelines and evidence-based interventions on treating dental diseases with established association with systemic conditions.; CONCLUSIONS: Dentists' unmet information needs call for more research into the association between less studied dental conditions and systemic diseases, and more actionable clinical guidelines for well-researched disease connections. To improve dissemination and foster behavioral change, it is imperative to understand what information clinicians need and in which situations. Leveraging peer influence via social media could be a useful strategy to achieve the goal.

AB Microbial source tracking (MST) methods were evaluated in the Source Identification Protocol Project (SIPP), in which 27 laboratories compared methods to identify host sources of fecal pollution from blinded water samples containing either one or two different fecal types collected from California. This paper details lessons learned from the SIPP study and makes recommendations to further advance the field of MST. Overall, results from the SIPP study demonstrated that methods are available that can correctly identify whether particular host sources including humans, cows and birds have contributed to contamination in a body of water. However, differences between laboratory protocols and data processing affected results and complicated interpretation of MST method performance in some cases. This was an issue particularly for samples that tested positive (non-zero Ct values) but below the limits of quantification or detection of a PCR assay. Although false positives were observed, such samples in the SIPP study often contained the fecal pollution source that was being targeted, i.e., the samples were true positives. Given these results, and the fact that MST often requires detection of targets present in low concentrations, we propose that such samples be reported and identified in a unique category to facilitate data analysis and method comparisons. Important data can be lost when such samples are simply reported as positive or negative. Actionable thresholds were not derived in the SIPP study due to limitations that included geographic scope, age of samples, and difficulties interpreting low concentrations of target in environmental samples. Nevertheless, the results of the study support the use of MST for water management, especially to prioritize impaired waters in need of remediation. Future integration of MST data into quantitative microbial risk assessments and other models could allow managers to more efficiently protect public health based on site conditions.

AB INTRODUCTION: Within healthcare settings, HIV-related stigma is a recognized barrier to access of HIV prevention and treatment services and yet, few efforts have been made to scale-up stigma reduction programs in service delivery. This is in part due to the lack of a brief, simple, standardized tool for measuring stigma among all levels of health facility staff that works across diverse HIV prevalence, language and healthcare settings. In response, an international consortium led by the Health Policy Project, has developed and field tested a stigma measurement tool for use with health facility staff.; METHODS: Experts participated in a content-development workshop to review an item pool of existing measures, identify gaps and prioritize questions. The resulting questionnaire was field tested in six diverse sites (China, Dominica, Egypt, Kenya, Puerto Rico and St. Christopher & Nevis). Respondents included clinical and non-clinical staff. Questionnaires were self- or interviewer-administered. Analysis of item performance across sites examined both psychometric properties and contextual issues.; RESULTS: The key outcome of the process was a substantially reduced questionnaire. Eighteen core questions measure three programmatically actionable drivers of stigma within health facilities (worry about HIV transmission, attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLHIV), and health facility environment, including policies), and enacted stigma. The questionnaire also includes one short scale for attitudes towards PLHIV (5-item scale, alpha=0.78).; CONCLUSIONS: Stigma-reduction programmes in healthcare facilities are urgently needed to improve the quality of care provided, uphold the human right to healthcare, increase access to health services, and maximize investments in HIV prevention and treatment. This brief, standardized tool will facilitate inclusion of stigma measurement in research studies and in routine facility data collection, allowing for the monitoring of stigma within healthcare facilities and evaluation of stigma-reduction programmes. There is potential for wide use of the tool either as a stand-alone survey or integrated within other studies of health facility staff.

AB Biomarker-stratified cancer pharmacotherapy was pioneered in the care of breast cancer patients. The utility of agents modulating hormone receptors, synthesis of steroid hormones, or HER2-targeting agents has been greatly enhanced by the detection of predictive biomarkers in diagnostic tumor samples. Based on deeper understanding of breast cancer biology multiple drug candidates have been developed to modulate additional molecular targets which may associate with specific biomarker profiles. Accordingly, exploratory biomarkers are increasingly incorporated in early clinical trials, thus demanding a new process of patient selection. Here, we describe the implementation of preemptive, multiplexed biomarker profiling linked to standard diagnostic algorithms for metastatic breast cancer patients treated at the West German Cancer Center. Profiling for experimental biomarkers was prospectively offered to patients with metastatic breast cancer who met generic clinical trial inclusion criteria. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were retrieved and studied for potentially actionable biomarkers related to active clinical trials by immunohistochemistry, amplicon sequencing, and in situ hybridization. The clinical course of those profiled patients was closely monitored to offer trial participation whenever applicable. Here, we report results from the first 131 patients enrolled in this program. PIK3CA mutations (23 %) and amplifications (2 %), loss of PTEN expression (13 %), and FGFR1 amplifications (8 %) were detected next to established biomarkers such as estrogen (67 %) and progesterone receptor expression (52 %), and HER2 overexpression or amplification (23 %). So far 16 profiled patients (12 %) have been enrolled in biomarker-stratified early clinical trials. Preemptive profiling of investigational biomarkers can be integrated into the diagnostic algorithm of a large Comprehensive Cancer Center.

AB Currently, only one drug, sorafenib, is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), achieving modest objective response rates while still conferring an overall survival benefit. Unlike other solid tumors, no oncogenic addiction loops have been validated as clinically actionable targets in HCC. Outcomes of HCC could potentially be improved if critical molecular subclasses with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities can be identified, biomarkers that predict recurrence or progression early can be determined and key epigenetic, genetic or microenvironment drivers that determine best response to a specific targeting treatment can be uncovered. Our group and others have examined the molecular heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma. We have developed a panel of patient derived xenograft models to enable focused pre-clinical drug development of rationally designed therapies in specific molecular subgroups. We observed unique patterns, including synergies, of drug activity across our molecularly diverse HCC xenografts, pointing to specific therapeutic vulnerabilities for individual tumors. These efforts inform clinical trial designs and catalyze therapeutic development. It also argues for efficient strategic allocation of patients into appropriate enriched clinical trials. Here, we will discuss some of the recent important therapeutic studies in advanced HCC and also some of the potential strategies to optimize clinical therapeutic development moving forward.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The advent of integrated genomics revealed profound insights into medulloblastoma pathogenesis. However, these biological findings have yet to be translated into the clinic, as current treatment comprises surgical resection, conventional irradiation, and chemotherapy resulting in significant long-term sequelae. We sought to highlight the potential areas for targeted therapy based on our new understanding of the subgroup-specific tumor biology.; RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, four distinct molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma have been identified [WNT (wingless), SHH (sonic hedgehog), Group 3, and Group 4]. Profiling of these subgroups revealed distinct genomic events, several of which represent actionable targets for therapy. Specifically, stratification of patients into their respective subgroups has profound prognostic impact, wherein therapy can be de-escalated in patients with favorable prognosis, and intensified therapy or novel agents can be considered in patients with poor prognosis. Novel subgroup-specific therapies are being explored in clinical trials, particularly for the SHH subgroup. Epigenetic modifiers are also recurrently affected in medulloblastoma suggesting that epigenetic therapy can be considered in a subset of patients.; SUMMARY: The identification of subgroup-specific, actionable therapeutic targets has the potential to revolutionize therapy for medulloblastoma patients, and result in significantly improved quality of life in survivors and improved overall survival.

AB INTRODUCTION: The imaging evaluation of pulmonary nodules, often incidentally detected on imaging examinations performed for other clinical reasons, is a frequently encountered clinical circumstance. With advances in imaging modalities, both the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules continue to evolve and improve.; AREAS COVERED: This article will review the imaging modalities used to detect and diagnose benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, with a focus on computed tomography (CT), which continues to be the mainstay for evaluation. The authors discuss recent advances in the lung nodule management, and an algorithm for the management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules.; EXPERT OPINION: There are set of criteria that define a benign nodule, the most important of which are the lack of temporal change for 2 years or more, and certain benign imaging criteria, including specific patterns of calcification or the presence of fat. Although some indeterminate pulmonary nodules are immediately actionable, generally those approaching 1 cm or larger in diameter, at which size the diagnostic accuracy of tools such as positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, single photon emission CT (SPECT) and biopsy techniques are sufficient to warrant their use. The majority of indeterminate pulmonary nodules are under 1 cm, for which serial CT examinations through at least 2 years for solid nodules and 3 years for ground-glass nodules, are used to demonstrate either benign biologic behavior or otherwise. The management of incidental pulmonary nodules involves a multidisciplinary approach in which radiology plays a pivotal role. Newer imaging and postprocessing techniques have made this a more accurate technique eliminating ambiguity and unnecessary follow-up.

AB The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently issued recommendations for reporting incidental findings from clinical whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. The recommendations call for evaluating a specific set of genes as part of all whole-genome sequencing/whole-exome sequencing and reporting all pathogenic variants irrespective of patient age. The genes are associated with highly penetrant disorders for which treatment or prevention is available. The effort to generate a list of genes with actionable findings is commendable, but the recommendations raise several concerns. They constitute a call for opportunistic screening, through intentional effort to identify pathogenic variants in specified genes unrelated to the clinical concern that prompted testing. Yet for most of the genes, we lack evidence about the predictive value of testing, genotype penetrance, spectrum of phenotypes, and efficacy of interventions in unselected populations. Furthermore, the recommendations do not allow patients to decline the additional findings, a position inconsistent with established norms. Finally, the recommendation to return adult-onset disease findings when children are tested is inconsistent with current professional consensus, including other policy statements of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Instead of premature practice recommendations, we call for robust dialogue among stakeholders to define a pathway to normatively sound, evidence-based guidelines.

AB As genomic and exomic testing expands in both the research and clinical arenas, determining whether, how, and which incidental findings to return to the ordering clinician and patient becomes increasingly important. Although opinion is varied on what should be returned to consenting patients or research participants, most experts agree that return of medically actionable results should be considered. There is insufficient evidence to fully inform evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding return of results from genome-scale sequencing, and thus generation of such evidence is imperative, given the rapidity with which genome-scale diagnostic tests are being incorporated into clinical care. We present an overview of the approaches to incidental findings by members of the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research network, funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute, to generate discussion of these approaches by the clinical genomics community. We also report specific lists of "medically actionable" genes that have been generated by a subset of investigators in order to explore what types of findings have been included or excluded in various contexts. A discussion of the general principles regarding reporting of novel variants, challenging cases (genes for which consensus was difficult to achieve across Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research network sites), solicitation of preferences from participants regarding return of incidental findings, and the timing and context of return of incidental findings are provided.Genet Med 15 11, 860-867.Genetics in Medicine (2013); 15 11, 860-867. doi:10.1038/gim.2013.133.

AB PURPOSE: Comprehensive genomic analysis including exome and genome sequencing is increasingly being utilized in research studies, leading to the generation of incidental genetic findings. It is unclear how researchers plan to deal with incidental genetic findings.; METHODS: We conducted a survey of the practices and attitudes of 234 members of the US genetic research community and performed qualitative semistructured interviews with 28 genomic researchers to understand their views and experiences with incidental genetic research findings.; RESULTS: We found that 12% of the researchers had returned incidental genetic findings, and an additional 28% planned to do so. A large majority of researchers (95%) believe that incidental findings for highly penetrant disorders with immediate medical implications should be offered to research participants. However, there was no consensus on returning incidental results for other conditions varying in penetrance and medical actionability. Researchers raised concerns that the return of incidental findings would impose significant burdens on research and could potentially have deleterious effects on research participants if not performed well. Researchers identified assistance needed to enable effective, accurate return of incidental findings.; CONCLUSION: The majority of the researchers believe that research participants should have the option to receive at least some incidental genetic research results.

AB The Rad Resilient City Checklist is a local planning tool that can help save tens of thousands of lives following a nuclear detonation. If prevention of nuclear terrorism fails, then reducing exposure to radioactive fallout is the intervention that can save the most lives following a nuclear detonation. Yet, most Americans are not familiar with correct safety measures against fallout, and many believe that nothing can be done to reduce the suffering and death inflicted by a nuclear attack. Moreover, cities have no checklist on how to prepare the emergency management infrastructure and the larger population for this hazard, despite hundreds of pages of useful guidance from the federal government and radiation professional organizations. The Rad Resilient City Checklist reverses this situation by converting the latest federal guidance and technical reports into clear, actionable steps for communities to take to protect their residents from exposure to radioactive fallout. The checklist reflects the shared judgment of the Nuclear Resilience Expert Advisory Group, a national panel led by the Center for Biosecurity and comprised of government decision makers, scientific experts, emergency responders, and leaders from business, volunteer, and community sectors.

AB This article describes an oil spill surveillance strategy implemented in response to BP's 2010 MC252 oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. A three-pronged strategy consisted of Geographic Information System (GIS) monitoring of the surface slick, hydrodynamic modeling of the potential movement of the slick within the Basin, and weekly field reconnaissance. Our analysis was completed in near real time during the event and the results and predictions helped local responders minimize oiling impacts in Lake Pontchartrain. No prior planning was undertaken before this crisis response, and this article reports our support activities as they happened. For the GIS component, a remote sensing derived surface slick outline layer was obtained to produce near daily maps showing the slick's proximity to Lake Pontchartrain along with weather conditions and deployed response assets. This regular monitoring of the slicks' location was complemented by hydrodynamic numerical modeling that simulated the currents that determined the trajectories of oil particles. These data were ground-truthed through weekly reconnaissance trips that assessed the potential routes of oil penetration into Lake Pontchartrain for the presence of sheen, tarballs, and other oil constituents. Despite the ad hoc design and on-the-fly implementation, these three assessments provided consistent and actionable information.

AB Reduced costs and increased speed and accuracy of sequencing can bring the genome-based evaluation of individual disease risk to the bedside. While past efforts have identified a number of actionable mutations, the bulk of genetic risk remains hidden in sequence data. The biggest challenge facing genomic medicine today is the development of new techniques to predict the specifics of a given human phenome (set of all expressed phenotypes) encoded by each individual variome (full set of genome variants) in the context of the given environment. Numerous tools exist for the computational identification of the functional effects of a single variant. However, the pipelines taking advantage of full genomic, exomic, transcriptomic (and other) sequences have only recently become a reality. This review looks at the building of methodologies for predicting "variome"-defined disease risk. It also discusses some of the challenges for incorporating such a pipeline into everyday medical practice. © 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more deaths than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined. While treatment decisions are determined primarily by stage, therapeutically non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has traditionally been treated as a single disease. However, recent findings have led to the recognition of histology and molecular subtypes as important determinants in treatment selection. Identifying the genetic differences that define these molecular and histological subtypes has the potential to impact treatment and as such is currently the focus of much research. Microarray and genomic sequencing efforts have provided unparalleled insight into the genomes of lung cancer subtypes, specifically adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), revealing subtype specific genomic alterations and molecular subtypes as well as differences in cell signaling pathways. In this review, we discuss the recurrent genomic alterations characteristic of AC and SqCC (including molecular subtypes), their therapeutic implications and emerging clinical practices aimed at tailoring treatments based on a tumor's molecular alterations with the hope of improving patient response and survival.

AB OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' and family members' views on communication during cancer care and to identify those aspects of clinician-patient communication which were most important to patients and family members.; METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of qualitative data from 137 patients with cancer and family members of patients with cancer. We used a modified version of the constant comparative method and coding paradigm of grounded theory.; RESULTS: Patients want sensitive, caring clinicians who provide information that they need, when they need it, in a way that they can understand; who listen and respond to questions and concerns, and who attempt to understand the patient's experience. Effective information exchange and a positive interpersonal relationship with the clinician were of fundamental importance to patients and family members. These were interrelated; for instance, failure to provide information a patient needed could damage the relationship, whereas excellent listening could foster the relationship. Information exchange and relationship were also integral to decision-making, managing uncertainty, responding to emotions, and self-management. Clinicians who were responsive to patients' needs beyond the immediate medical encounter were valued.; CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of cancer care today suggests that efforts to improve communication must be multilevel, acknowledging and addressing patient, clinician, organizational and policy barriers, and facilitators. Measurement tools are needed to assess cancer patients' and family members' experiences with communication over the course of cancer care to provide meaningful, actionable feedback to those seeking to optimize their effectiveness in communicating with patients with cancer.

AB A crucial issue in healthcare is how multidisciplinary teams can use indicators for quality improvement. Such teams have increasingly become the core component in both care delivery and in many quality improvement methods. This study aims to investigate the relationships between (1) team factors and the way multidisciplinary teams use indicators for quality improvement, and (2) both team and process factors and the intended results. An in-depth, multiple-case study was conducted in the Netherlands in 2008 involving four breast cancer teams using six structure, process and outcome indicators. The results indicated that the process of using indicators involves several stages and activities. Two teams applied a more intensive, active and interactive approach as they passed through these stages. These teams were perceived to have achieved good results through indicator use compared to the other two teams who applied a simple control approach. All teams experienced some difficulty in integrating the new formal control structure, i.e. measuring and managing performance, in their operational task, and in using their 'new' managerial task to decide as a team what and how to improve. Our findings indicate the presence of a network of relationships between team factors, the controllability and actionability of indicators, the indicator-use process, and the intended results.

AB The incidence of oesophagogastric junctional (OGJ) adenocarcinoma is rising rapidly in western countries, in contrast to the declining frequency of distal gastric carcinoma. Treatment options for adenocarcinomas involving the oesophagogastric junction are limited and the overall prognosis is extremely poor. To determine the genomic landscape of OGJ adenocarcinoma, exomes of eight tumours and matched germline DNA were subjected to massively parallel DNA sequencing. Microsatellite instability was observed in three tumours which coincided with an elevated number of somatic mutations. In total, 117 genes were identified that had predicted coding alterations in more than one tumour. Potentially actionable coding mutations were identified in 67 of these genes, including those in CR2, HGF , FGFR4, and ESRRB. Twenty-nine genes harbouring somatic coding mutations and copy number changes in the MSS OGJ dataset are also known to be altered with similar predicted functional consequence in other tumour types. Compared with the published mutational profile of gastric cancers, 49% (57/117) of recurrently mutated genes were unique to OGJ tumours. TP53, SYNE1, and ARID1A were amongst the most frequently mutated genes in a larger OGJ cohort. Our study provides an insight into the mutational landscape of OGJ adenocarcinomas and confirms that this is a highly mutated and heterogeneous disease. Furthermore, we have uncovered somatic mutations in therapeutically relevant genes which may represent candidate drug targets. 2013 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB As more clinically relevant cancer genes are identified, comprehensive diagnostic approaches are needed to match patients to therapies, raising the challenge of optimization and analytical validation of assays that interrogate millions of bases of cancer genomes altered by multiple mechanisms. Here we describe a test based on massively parallel DNA sequencing to characterize base substitutions, short insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations and selected fusions across 287 cancer-related genes from routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens. We implemented a practical validation strategy with reference samples of pooled cell lines that model key determinants of accuracy, including mutant allele frequency, indel length and amplitude of copy change. Test sensitivity achieved was 95-99% across alteration types, with high specificity (positive predictive value >99%). We confirmed accuracy using 249 FFPE cancer specimens characterized by established assays. Application of the test to 2,221 clinical cases revealed clinically actionable alterations in 76% of tumors, three times the number of actionable alterations detected by current diagnostic tests.

AB Care coordination and transitional care services are strategically important for achieving the priorities of better care, better health, and reduced costs embodied in the National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care (National Quality Strategy [NQS]). Some of the most vulnerable times in a persons care occur with changes in condition as well as movement within and between settings of care. The American Academy of Nursing (AAN) believes it is essential to facilitate the coordination of care and transitions by using health information technology (HIT) to collect, share, and analyze data that communicate patient-centered information among patients, families, and care providers across communities. HIT makes information accessible, actionable, timely, customizable, and portable. Rapid access to information also creates efficiencies in care by eliminating redundancies and illuminating health history and prior care. The adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and information systems can enable care coordination to be more effective but only when a number of essential elements are addressed to reflect the team-based nature of care coordination as well as a focus on the individuals needs and preferences. To that end, the AAN offers a set of recommendations to guide the development of the infrastructure, standards, content, and measures for electronically enabled care coordination and transitions in care as well as research needed to build the evidence base to assess outcomes of the associated interventions.

AB PU-H71 is a purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitor that, in contrast to other Hsp90 inhibitors, displays unique selectivity for binding the fraction of Hsp90 that is preferentially associated with oncogenic client proteins and enriched in tumor cells (teHsp90). This property allows PU-H71 to potently suppress teHsp90 without inducing toxicity in normal cells. We found that lymphoma cells infected by Epstein-Barr virus or Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) are exquisitely sensitive to this compound. Using PU-H71 affinity capture and proteomics, an unbiased approach to reveal oncogenic networks, we identified the teHsp90 interactome in KSHV(+) primary effusion lymphoma cells. Viral and cellular proteins were identified, including many involved in nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling, apoptosis, and autophagy. KSHV vFLIP is a viral oncoprotein homologous to cFLIPs, with NF-kappaB-activating and antiapoptotic activities. We show that teHsp90 binds vFLIP but not cFLIPs. Treatment with PU-H71 induced degradation of vFLIP and IKKgamma, NF-kappaB downregulation, apoptosis and autophagy in vitro, and more importantly, tumor responses in mice. Analysis of the interactome revealed apoptosis as a central pathway; therefore, we tested a BCL2 family inhibitor in primary effusion lymphoma cells. We found strong activity and synergy with PU-H71. Our findings demonstrate PU-H71 affinity capture identifies actionable networks that may help design rational combinations of effective therapies.

AB The incorporation of genomics into medicine is stimulating interest on the return of incidental findings (IFs) from exome and genomesequencing. However, no large-scale study has yet estimated the number of expected actionable findings per individual; therefore, we classified actionable pathogenic single-nucleotide variants in 500 European- and 500 African-descent participants randomly selected from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project. The 1,000 individuals were screened for variants in 114 genes selected by an expert panel for their association with medically actionable genetic conditions possibly undiagnosed in adults. Among the 1,000 participants, 585 instances of 239 unique variants were identified as disease causing in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). The primary literature supporting the variants' pathogenicity was reviewed. Of the identified IFs, only 16 unique autosomal-dominant variants in 17 individuals were assessed to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic, and one participant had two pathogenic variants for an autosomal-recessive disease. Furthermore, one pathogenic and four likely pathogenic variants not listed as disease causing in HGMD were identified. These data can provide an estimate of the frequency (3.4% for European descent and 1.2% for African descent) of the high-penetrance actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in adults. The 23 participants with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were disproportionately of European (17) versus African (6) descent. The process of classifying these variants underscores the need for a more comprehensive and diverse centralized resource to provide curated information on pathogenicity for clinical use to minimize health disparities in genomic medicine.

AB PURPOSE: Quality improvement (QI) requires measurement, but medical schools rarely provide opportunities for students to measure their patient outcomes. The authors tested the feasibility and perceived impact of a quality metric report card as part of an Education-Centered Medical Home longitudinal curriculum.; METHOD: Student teams were embedded into faculty practices and assigned a panel of patients to follow longitudinally. Students performed retrospective chart reviews and reported deidentified data on 30 nationally endorsed QI metrics for their assigned patients. Scorecards were created for each clinic team. Students completed pre/post surveys on self-perceived QI skills.; RESULTS: A total of 405 of their patients' charts were abstracted by 149 students (76% response rate; mean 2.7 charts/student). Median abstraction time was 21.8 (range: 13.1-37.1) minutes. Abstracted data confirmed that the students had successfully recruited a "high-risk" patient panel. Initial performance on abstracted quality measures ranged from 100% adherence on the use of beta-blockers in postmyocardial infarction patients to 24% on documentation of dilated diabetic eye exams. After the chart abstraction assignment, grand rounds, and background readings, student self-assessment of their perceived QI skills significantly increased for all metrics, though it remained low.; CONCLUSIONS: Creation of an actionable health care quality report card as part of an ambulatory longitudinal experience is feasible, and it improves student perception of QI skills. Future research will aim to use statistical process control methods to track health care quality prospectively as our students use their scorecards to drive clinic-level improvement efforts.

AB INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer remains a significant scientific, clinical and societal challenge. This gap analysis has reviewed and critically assessed enduring issues and new challenges emerging from recent research, and proposes strategies for translating solutions into practice.; METHODS: More than 100 internationally recognised specialist breast cancer scientists, clinicians and healthcare professionals collaborated to address nine thematic areas: genetics, epigenetics and epidemiology; molecular pathology and cell biology; hormonal influences and endocrine therapy; imaging, detection and screening; current/novel therapies and biomarkers; drug resistance; metastasis, angiogenesis, circulating tumour cells, cancer 'stem' cells; risk and prevention; living with and managing breast cancer and its treatment. The groups developed summary papers through an iterative process which, following further appraisal from experts and patients, were melded into this summary account.; RESULTS: The 10 major gaps identified were: (1) understanding the functions and contextual interactions of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal breast development and during malignant transformation; (2) how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight) and chemopreventive strategies; (3) the need for tailored screening approaches including clinically actionable tests; (4) enhancing knowledge of molecular drivers behind breast cancer subtypes, progression and metastasis; (5) understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity, dormancy, de novo or acquired resistance and how to target key nodes in these dynamic processes; (6) developing validated markers for chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity; (7) understanding the optimal duration, sequencing and rational combinations of treatment for improved personalised therapy; (8) validating multimodality imaging biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis and monitoring of responses in primary and metastatic disease; (9) developing interventions and support to improve the survivorship experience; (10) a continuing need for clinical material for translational research derived from normal breast, blood, primary, relapsed, metastatic and drug-resistant cancers with expert bioinformatics support to maximise its utility. The proposed infrastructural enablers include enhanced resources to support clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumour models; improved access to appropriate, fully annotated clinical samples; extended biomarker discovery, validation and standardisation; and facilitated cross-discipline working.; CONCLUSIONS: With resources to conduct further high-quality targeted research focusing on the gaps identified, increased knowledge translating into improved clinical care should be achievable within five years.

AB Strategies to effectively treat people with CKD have been identified by conventional clinical research. Despite this evidence, awareness, screening, detection, diagnosis, risk factor control, treatment, and outcomes remain substandard. Translating clinical evidence into actionable measures that reduce the burden of CKD is a pressing need. Expansion from a "bench-to-bedside" paradigm (conventional type 1 translation) to research that encompasses "clinic and community" is the core concept of type 2 translation. Specifically, this is the discipline of identifying factors and using strategies that lead to adoption, maintenance, and sustainability of science-based interventions in practice. This review identifies key elements of type 2 translational research and highlights the current scope of this type of research for CKD. For type 2 translation to achieve the goals of providing high-quality care and better health outcomes, key facilitators (e.g., theory-based frameworks, adaptable interventions, and inclusion of sustainability and evaluation metrics) and essential elements (e.g., multidisciplinary team care, health information technology, and stakeholder engagement) must be integrated. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently funded five proposals that aim to improve outcomes for people with CKD, focusing on diverse components of the healthcare continuum: patient safety and transitions; delivery of high-quality, evidence-based CKD care; and elimination of disparities. The need for type 2 translational research in CKD is urgent because of preventable human suffering and unsustainable costs of providing care. Focus on the theory, framework, and approaches we have suggested may help us meet that challenge.

AB PURPOSE: Multiple investigational drugs are currently explored in cancer patient populations defined by specific biomarkers. This demands a new process of patient selection for clinical trials.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Starting January 1, 2012, preemptive biomarker profiling was offered at the West German Cancer Center to all patients with advanced non-small-cell lung (NSCLC) or colorectal cancer (CRC), who met generic study inclusion criteria. Tumour specimens were subjected to prespecified profiling algorithms to detect 'actionable biomarkers' by amplicon sequencing, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. The clinical course was closely monitored to offer trial participation whenever applicable.; RESULTS: Within 12 months, 267 patients (188 NSCLC, 79 CRC) were profiled. Estimated additional cost for biomarker profiling was 219615.51 EUR excluding histopathology workup and administration. The most prevalent biomarkers in pulmonary adenocarcinoma were KRAS mutations (29%), loss of PTEN expression (18%), EGFR mutations (9%), HER2 amplification (5%) and BRAF mutations (3%), while the prevalence of ALK translocations and PIK3CA mutations was extremely low. In pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma FGFR1 amplifications were found in 15%, PTEN expression was lost in 20% and DDR2 was mutated in a single case. KRAS mutations (41%) predominated in CRC, followed by loss of PTEN expression (16%), PIK3CA (5%) and BRAF (5%) mutations. So far 13 patients (5%) have entered biomarker-stratified clinical trials. Therapeutic decisions for approved drugs were guided in another 45 patients (17%).; CONCLUSION: Preemptive biomarker profiling can be implemented into the diagnostic algorithm of a large Comprehensive Cancer Center. Substantial investments in diagnostics and administration are required. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: The design of electronic health records to translate genomic medicine into clinical care is crucial to successful introduction of new genomic services, yet there are few published guides to implementation.; METHODS: The design, implemented features, and evolution of a locally developed electronic health record that supports a large pharmacogenomics program at a tertiary-care academic medical center was tracked over a 4-year development period.; RESULTS: Developers and program staff created electronic health record mechanisms for ordering a pharmacogenomics panel in advance of clinical need (preemptive genotyping) and in response to a specific drug indication. Genetic data from panel-based genotyping were sequestered from the electronic health record until drug-gene interactions met evidentiary standards and deemed clinically actionable. A service to translate genotype to predicted drug-response phenotype populated a summary of drug-gene interactions, triggered inpatient and outpatient clinical decision support, updated laboratory records, and created gene results within online personal health records.; CONCLUSION: The design of a locally developed electronic health record supporting pharmacogenomics has generalizable utility. The challenge of representing genomic data in a comprehensible and clinically actionable format is discussed along with reflection on the scalability of the model to larger sets of genomic data.

AB Introduce the notion of cross-sectional relatedness as an informational dependence relation between sentences in the conclusion section of a breast radiology report and sentences in the findings section of the same report. Assess inter-rater agreement of breast radiologists. Develop and evaluate a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for automatically detecting cross-sectional relatedness. A standard reference is manually created from 444 breast radiology reports by the first author. A subset of 37 reports is annotated by five breast radiologists. Inter-rater agreement is computed among their annotations and standard reference. Thirteen numerical features are developed to characterize pairs of sentences; the optimal feature set is sought through forward selection. Inter-rater agreement is F-measure 0.623. SVM classifier has F-measure of 0.699 in the 12-fold cross-validation protocol against standard reference. Report length does not correlate with the classifier's performance (correlation coefficient=-0.073). SVM classifier has average F-measure of 0.505 against annotations by breast radiologists. Mediocre inter-rater agreement is possibly caused by: (1) definition is insufficiently actionable, (2) fine-grained nature of cross-sectional relatedness on sentence level, instead of, for instance, on paragraph level, and (3) higher-than-average complexity of 37-report sample. SVM classifier performs better against standard reference than against breast radiologists's annotations. This is supportive of (3). SVM's performance on standard reference is satisfactory. Since optimal feature set is not breast specific, results may transfer to non-breast anatomies. Applications include a smart report viewing environment and data mining.

AB OBJECTIVES: Defining 'best practice' is one of the first and crucial steps in any Knowledge Translation (KT) research project. Without a sound understanding of what exactly should happen in practice, it is impossible to measure the extent of existing gaps between 'desired' and 'actual' care, set implementation goals, and monitor performance. The aim of this paper is to present a practical, stepped and interactive process to develop best practice recommendations that are actionable, locally applicable and in line with the best available research-based evidence, with a view to adapt these into process measures (quality indicators) for KT research purposes.; METHODS: Our process encompasses the following steps: (1) identify current, high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and extract recommendations; (2) select strong recommendations in key clinical management areas; (3) update evidence and create evidence overviews; (4) discuss evidence and produce agreed 'evidence statements'; (5) discuss the relevance of the evidence with local stakeholders; and (6) develop locally applicable actionable best practice recommendations, suitable for use as the basis of quality indicators.; CONCLUSIONS: Actionable definitions of local best practice are a prerequisite for doing KT research. As substantial resources go into rigorously synthesizing evidence and developing CPGs, it is important to make best use of such available resources. We developed a process for efficiently developing locally applicable actionable best practice recommendations from existing high-quality CPGs that are in line with current research evidence. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB United States health care costs are growing at an unsustainable rate; one significant contributor has been the overuse of health services. Physicians have a professional ethical obligation to serve as stewards of society's resources and take responsibility for health care costs. We propose a framework for identifying overused services and a research and implementation agenda to guide stewardship efforts to demonstrate the value of emergency care. Examples of interventions to reduce the cost of emergency care along six value streams are discussed: laboratory tests, high-cost imaging, medication administration, intravenous fluids and medications, hospital admissions and post-discharge care. Structural and political hurdles such as the Emergency Medical and Active Labor Act mandate, medico-legal concerns, lack of provider knowledge about costs and economic conflicts are identified. A research agenda focused on identifying low value clinical actions and potential interventions for overuse reduction is detailed. A policy agenda is proposed for organized emergency medicine to convene a structured, collaborative process to identify and prioritize clinical decisions that are of little value to patients, amenable to improvement through standardization, and actionable by front-line providers. Emergency medicine cannot wait longer to identify areas of low value care, or else other groups will impose external standards on our practice. Development of a Top Five list for emergency medicine will begin to demonstrate our professional ethical commitment to our patients and health system improvement.  © 2013.

AB It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.

AB Lung cancer in never-smokers was recognised as a distinct clinical entity around the mid-2000s because these patients tended to be Asian women and diagnosed at a younger age with a preponderance of adenocarcinoma and better survival outcome despite a more advanced stage of presentation. It was soon discovered that lung cancer in never-smokers had a higher prevalence of activating EGFR mutations and we tend to classify lung cancer by smoking status for screening purpose. With the discoveries of many actionable driver mutations such as activating EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement in adenocarcinoma of the lung we have switched to classifying non-small cell lung cancer into different individual molecular subgroups based on the presence of a dominant driver mutation. Although many actionable driver mutations are found in never-smokers with adenocarcinoma, this review will summarise that a substantial proportion of patients with these actionable driver mutations had a previous smoking history. Alternatively among the driver mutations that are associated with smoking history, a fair amount of these patients were never-smokers. Thus smoking status should not be used as a screen strategy for identifying driver mutations in clinical practice. Finally smoking history may have predictive and/or prognostic significance within individual molecular subgroups and identifying the difference according to smoking history may help optimise future targeted therapy.

AB Little is known about the decisions and perspectives of participants undergoing direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTCGT). The aims of this study were to examine the views, attitudes and decision-making factors of primary care patients regarding DTCGT. Their experience of and reactions to testing also emerged during the study. In this longitudinal, qualitative study, 20 primary care patients participated in DTCGT and individual interviews: (1) prior to testing after the informed consent session, (2) after receiving results, (3) 3months post-test, and (4) 12months post-test. Interviews included open-ended questions and all transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory, constant comparison methods. Five key themes emerged from data analysis as participants underwent DTCGT and reflected on their decision over time: (1) limited concerns about DTCGT, (2) motivations for testing, (3) expectations of testing, (4) understanding of results, and (5) impact of testing and results. While a few participants expressed concerns before testing, participants were motivated to test by curiosity, gaining actionable knowledge, and altruism. Most were uncertain of what to expect from DTCGT and needed assistance in understanding results. While many reported testing had no significant impact on them, being relieved or pleased after testing was the most common emotional effect. Notably, a few participants made positive health changes in response to testing. Given the paucity of information about primary care patients and DTCGT, this study adds more in-depth information to the emerging research on how such participants' view, make decisions about, experience and react to DTCGT over time. Because uncertainty remains about the accuracy of DTCGT, the response of primary care patients to this testing requires further investigation.

AB Cancer therapy is challenged by the diversity of molecular implementations of oncogenic processes and by the resulting variation in therapeutic responses. Projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provide molecular tumor maps in unprecedented detail. The interpretation of these maps remains a major challenge. Here we distilled thousands of genetic and epigenetic features altered in cancers to 500 selected functional events (SFEs). Using this simplified description, we derived a hierarchical classification of 3,299 TCGA tumors from 12 cancer types. The top classes are dominated by either mutations (M class) or copy number changes (C class). This distinction is clearest at the extremes of genomic instability, indicating the presence of different oncogenic processes. The full hierarchy shows functional event patterns characteristic of multiple cross-tissue groups of tumors, termed oncogenic signature classes. Targetable functional events in a tumor class are suggestive of class-specific combination therapy. These results may assist in the definition of clinical trials to match actionable oncogenic signatures with personalized therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: Until recently only two indicators were used to evaluate malaria prevention with insecticide-treated nets (ITN): "proportion of households with any ITN" and "proportion of the population using an ITN last night". This study explores the potential of the expanded set of indicators recommended by the Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) for comprehensive analysis of universal coverage with ITN by applying them to the Nigeria 2010 Malaria Indicator Survey data.; METHODS: The two additional indicators of "proportion of households with at least one ITN for every two people" and "proportion of population with access to an ITN within the household" were calculated as recommended by MERG. Based on the estimates for each of the four ITN indicators three gaps were calculated: i) households with no ITN, ii) households with any but not enough ITN, iii) population with access to ITN not using it. In addition, coverage with at least one ITN at community level was explored by applying Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) decision rules to the cluster level of the data. All outcomes were analysed by household background characteristics and whether an ITN campaign had recently been done.; RESULTS: While the proportion of households with any ITN was only 42% overall, it was 75% in areas with a recent mass campaign and in these areas 66% of communities had coverage of 80% or better. However, the campaigns left a considerable intra-household ownership gap with 66% of households with any ITN not having enough for every family member. In contrast, the analysis comparing actual against potential use showed that ITN utilization was good overall with only 19% of people with access not using the ITN, but with a significant difference between the North, where use was excellent (use gap 11%), and the South (use gap 36%) indicating the need for enhanced behaviour change communication.; CONCLUSIONS: The expanded ITN indicators to assess universal coverage provide strong tools for a comprehensive system effectiveness analysis that produces clear, actionable evidence of progress as well as the need for specific additional interventions clearly differentiating between gaps in ownership and use.

AB Current trends in biosecurity and cybersecurity include (1) the wide availability of technology and specialized knowledge that previously were available only to governments; (2) the global economic recession, which may increase the spread of radical non-state actors; and (3) recent US and EU commission reports that reflect concerns about non-state actors in asymmetric threats. The intersectoral and international nature of bioterrorism and agroterrorism threats requires collaboration across several sectors including intelligence, police, forensics, customs, and other law enforcement organizations who must work together with public and animal health organizations as well as environmental and social science organizations. This requires coordinated decision making among these organizations, based on actionable knowledge and information sharing. The risk of not sharing information among organizations compared to the benefit of sharing information can be considered in an "information sharing risk-benefit analysis" to prevent a terrorism incident from occurring and to build a rapid response capability. In the EU project AniBioThreat, early warning is the main topic in work package 3 (WP 3). A strategy has been generated based on an iterative approach to bring law enforcement agencies and human and animal health institutes together. Workshops and exercises have taken place during the first half of the project, and spin-off activities include new preparedness plans for institutes and the formation of a legal adviser network for decision making. In addition, a seminar on actionable knowledge was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2012, which identified the need to bring various agency cultures together to work on developing a resilient capability to identify early signs of bio- and agroterrorism threats. The seminar concluded that there are a number of challenges in building a collaborative culture, including developing an education program that supports collaboration and shared situational awareness.

AB The introduction of clinical genome-wide sequencing raises complex issues regarding the management of incidental findings. However, there is a lack of empirical studies assessing views of providers involved in potential disclosure of such findings. In an anonymous survey of 279 clinical genetics professionals, we found that the vast majority of participants agreed that they were interested in knowing about clinically actionable incidental findings in themselves (96%) and their child (99%), and they reported that these types of findings should be disclosed in adult (96%) and minor (98%) patients. Approximately three-fourths agreed that they were personally interested in knowing about an adult-onset clinically actionable disease (78%) and a childhood-onset non-clinically actionable disease (75%) in their child. A similar percentage of participants (70%) felt that these two types of findings should be disclosed to patients. Forty-four percent of participants wanted to know about an incidental finding that indicates an adult-onset non-clinically actionable condition in themselves and 31% wanted to know about this type of information in their child. Findings from this study revealed participants' views highly dependent on clinical actionability. Further research is needed with a broader population of geneticists to increase generalizability, and with diverse patients to assess their perspectives about results disclosure from clinical sequencing.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB The number of systematic reviews published in the peer-reviewed literature has increased dramatically in the last decade, and for good reason. They have become an essential resource for clinicians who want unbiased and current answers for their clinical questions; researchers and funders who want to identify the most critical evidence gaps for study; payers and administrators who want to make coverage, formulary, and purchasing decisions; and policymakers who want to develop quality measures and clinical guidelines. Targeted to beginners interested in conducting their own systematic reviews and users of systematic reviews looking for a brief introduction, this primer (1) highlights the differences between review types; (2) outlines the major steps in performing a systematic review; and (3) offers a set of resources to help authors perform and report valid and actionable systematic reviews.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Thirty-five percent of bladder cancer patients either present with or develop muscle-invasive disease. The current standard of care for these patients is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystoprostatectomy or combined chemoradiotherapy. Despite these therapies, approximately 50% of patients will relapse after definitive locoregional treatment and eventually succumb to their disease.; RECENT FINDINGS: Therapies targeted at altered genetic pathways have proven efficacy in localized solid tumors including breast cancer, head and neck cancer and GIST. No such treatments have proven clinical benefit in bladder cancer, but targets under active investigation include HER2, epidermal growth factor receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, mTOR and others. Efforts are also underway to genetically define the subgroup of patients, which benefit from systemic platinum-based chemotherapy in this setting.; SUMMARY: Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the role of treatments targeted at actionable genetic mutations in bladder cancer. The key to maximizing the potential benefit from this treatment approach will be the identification of predictive biomarkers of response, the identification of safe combinations which block multiple signaling molecules synchronously, and the availability of faster, cheaper genetic testing in the clinic.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop, operationalize, and pilot test a transparent, reproducible, and evidence-informed method to determine when to report incidental findings from next-generation sequencing technologies.; METHODS: Using evidence-based principles, we proposed a three-stage process. Stage I "rules out" incidental findings below a minimal threshold of evidence and is evaluated using inter-rater agreement and comparison with an expert-based approach. Stage II documents criteria for clinical actionability using a standardized approach to allow experts to consistently consider and recommend whether results should be routinely reported (stage III). We used expert opinion to determine the face validity of stages II and III using three case studies. We evaluated the time and effort for stages I and II.; RESULTS: For stage I, we assessed 99 conditions and found high inter-rater agreement (89%), and strong agreement with a separate expert-based method. Case studies for familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary hemochromatosis, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency were all recommended for routine reporting as incidental findings. The method requires <3 days per topic.; CONCLUSION: We establish an operational definition of clinically actionable incidental findings and provide documentation and pilot testing of a feasible method that is scalable to the whole genome.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide and has no effective treatment, yet the molecular basis of hepatocarcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we report findings from a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of 88 matched HCC tumor/normal pairs, 81 of which are Hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive, seeking to identify genetically altered genes and pathways implicated in HBV-associated HCC. We find beta-catenin to be the most frequently mutated oncogene (15.9%) and TP53 the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor (35.2%). The Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT pathways, altered in 62.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively, are likely to act as two major oncogenic drivers in HCC. This study also identifies several prevalent and potentially actionable mutations, including activating mutations of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), in 9.1% of patients and provides a path toward therapeutic intervention of the disease.

AB To provide the safest and most effective patient care, alarms should be actionable, timely, and noticeable, they should clearly convey information, and they should be correctly addressed by caregivers. This requires that many things go right, from when a patient condition triggers an alarm to when an intervention is provided. Unfortunately, things sometimes go wrong. Find out where the process can break down, and how to prevent that from happening.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess predictors and costs of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse, a potential outcome measure in payer-manufacturer risk-sharing agreements for disease-modifying drugs (DMDs).; METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of medical/pharmacy claims was used. Study patients had ≥1 DMD (interferon beta, glatiramer, natalizumab) claim, without DMD claims in a 6-month pre-period before DMD initiation; were aged 18-64 years and continuously enrolled from the pre-period through a 24-month post-period; and had ≥2 MS medical claims during the 30-month study period. Post-period relapse cohorts included: (1) severe (hospitalization with MS diagnosis); (2) moderate (outpatient services including intravenous methylprednisolone); and (3) none. Poisson regression modeled severe relapse frequency, logistic regression modeled ≥1 severe relapse, and generalized linear modeling predicted healthcare costs. Tested predictors included demographics, insurance type, index DMD, pre-period health status, and DMD medication possession ratio (MPR).; RESULTS: Severe relapse was experienced by 14.5% and moderate relapse by 13.8% of 2291 patients. In logistic regression, severe relapse was predicted by plan type; age (odds ratio [OR]=1.018, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.005-1.031); pre-period Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR=1.307, 95% CI=1.166-1.464); pre-period proxy measure indicating impaired activities of daily living (OR=1.470, 95% CI=1.134-1.905); pre-period MS hospitalization (OR=2.174, 95% CI=1.537-3.074); and DMD non-adherence (MPR OR=0.101, 95% CI=0.068-0.151). Poisson regression results were similar. Predicted mean [standard deviation] all-cause healthcare expenditures were tripled for patients with severe compared with moderate relapse ($48,173 [$8665] and $13,334 [$1929], respectively).; LIMITATIONS: Commercially insured patients from a single payer; use may have been inconsistent with approved indications; proxy relapse measure may have misclassified patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Severe MS relapses requiring hospitalization, although affecting less than 15% of patients initiating DMD treatment, are associated with high medical costs. The only actionable predictor of severe relapse identified in observational analysis was MPR, raising questions about the feasibility of using observational data to guide outcomes-based contracting.

AB Congenital lower lip pits are cardinal findings of van der Woude syndrome [OMIM 119300]. The nosologic context of how lower lip pits are catalogued is easily lost because of insufficient clinical history, subtle findings misidentified as artifacts, lack of awareness by the pathologist, the perception that these are identify/confirm descriptive-diagnosis only, not necessarily an element of an actionable report, and/or the rarity with which these specimens are accessioned (in the authors' experience, less than 1 case per year). We present the salient findings on 19 lower lip pits specimens from the files of a single institution collected over the last 25 years.

AB Ambulatory ECG monitoring technology has rapidly evolved over the last few decades and has been shown to identify life-threatening and non-life threatening arrhythmias and provide actionable data to guide clinical decision making. Atrial fibrillation episodes can often be asymptomatic, even after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, creating a disconnect between symptoms and actual arrhythmia burden which may alter clinical management. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of invasive and non-invasive ECG monitoring strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation, with a special focus on the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and on follow-up of patients after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation ablation.  © 2013.

AB OBJECTIVE: Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was evaluated for its ability to identify unanticipated targetable genomic alterations (GA) for patients with relapsed ovarian epithelial carcinoma (OC).; METHODS: DNA sequencing was performed for 3320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer on indexed, adaptor ligated, hybridization-captured libraries using DNA isolated from FFPE sections from 48 histologically verified relapsed OC specimens. The original primary tumor was sequenced in 26 (54%) of the cases and recurrent/metastatic tumor site biopsies were sequenced in 22 (46%) of the cases. Actionability was defined as: GA that predict sensitivity or resistance to approved or standard therapies or are inclusion or exclusion criteria for specific experimental therapies in NCI registered clinical trials.; RESULTS: There were 38 (80%) serous, 5 (10%) endometrioid, 3 (6%) clear cell, 1 mucinous (2%) and 1 (2%) undifferentiated carcinomas. 141 GA were identified with an average of 2.9 GA (range 0-8) per tumor, of which 67 were actionable for an average of 1.4 actionable GA per patient (range 0-5). 33/48 (69%) of OC patient samples harbored at least one actionable GA. Most common GA were TP53 (79%); MYC (25%); BRCA1/2 (23%); KRAS (16.6%) and NF1 (14.5%). One tumor featured an ERBB2 point mutation. One of 3 (33%) of clear cell tumors featured cMET amplification validated by both FISH and IHC.; CONCLUSIONS: NGS assessment of therapy resistant OC identifies an unexpectedly high frequency of GA that could influence targeted therapy selection for the disease.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to define the prevalence and co-occurrence of actionable genomic alterations in patients with high-grade bladder cancer to serve as a platform for therapeutic drug discovery.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: An integrative analysis of 97 high-grade bladder tumors was conducted to identify actionable drug targets, which are defined as genomic alterations that have been clinically validated in another cancer type (eg, BRAF mutation) or alterations for which a selective inhibitor of the target or pathway is under clinical investigation. DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were defined by using array comparative genomic hybridization. Mutation profiling was performed by using both mass spectroscopy-based genotyping and Sanger sequencing.; RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of tumors harbored potentially actionable genomic alterations. A core pathway analysis of the integrated data set revealed a nonoverlapping pattern of mutations in the RTK-RAS-RAF and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways and regulators of G1-S cell cycle progression. Unsupervised clustering of CNAs defined two distinct classes of bladder tumors that differed in the degree of their CNA burden. Integration of mutation and copy number analyses revealed that mutations in TP53 and RB1 were significantly more common in tumors with a high CNA burden (P < .001 and P < .003, respectively).; CONCLUSION: High-grade bladder cancer possesses substantial genomic heterogeneity. The majority of tumors harbor potentially tractable genomic alterations that may predict for response to target-selective agents. Given the genomic diversity of bladder cancers, optimal development of target-specific agents will require pretreatment genomic characterization.

AB UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric was initiated in 2008 to drive quality improvement in children's surgery. Low mortality and morbidity in previous analyses limited differentiation of hospital performance.; METHODS: Participating institutions included children's units within general hospitals and free-standing children's hospitals. Cases selected by Current Procedural Terminology codes encompassed procedures within pediatric general, otolaryngologic, orthopedic, urologic, plastic, neurologic, thoracic, and gynecologic surgery. Trained personnel abstracted demographic, surgical profile, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables. Incorporating procedure-specific risk, hierarchical models for 30-day mortality and morbidities were developed with significant predictors identified by stepwise logistic regression. Reliability was estimated to assess the balance of information versus error within models.; RESULTS: In 2011, 46281 patients from 43 hospitals were accrued; 1467 codes were aggregated into 226 groupings. Overall mortality was 0.3%, composite morbidity 5.8%, and surgical site infection (SSI) 1.8%. Hierarchical models revealed outlier hospitals with above or below expected performance for composite morbidity in the entire cohort, pediatric abdominal subgroup, and spine subgroup; SSI in the entire cohort and pediatric abdominal subgroup; and urinary tract infection in the entire cohort. Based on reliability estimates, mortality discriminates performance poorly due to very low event rate; however, reliable model construction for composite morbidity and SSI that differentiate institutions is feasible.; CONCLUSIONS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric expansion has yielded risk-adjusted models to differentiate hospital performance in composite and specific morbidities. However, mortality has low utility as a children's surgery performance indicator. Programmatic improvements have resulted in actionable data.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is scope for better interaction between regulators, payers/HTA agencies, and medicines developers in their common objective of getting new medicines to patients. This paper reports on a tripartite early scientific advice pilot conducted by a pharmaceutical company (developer), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA: regulator) and the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee (PBAC) Secretariat (HTA agency) in Australia. The objective was to explore the practicality, feasibility, and sustainability of means of obtaining simultaneous scientific advice from both a regulatory and reimbursement perspective.; METHODS: Advice was sought for two development compounds in different disease areas. The focus was on matters of common interest to the TGA and the PBAC (i.e. the clinical evidence). Briefing books were prepared by the developer and supplied eight weeks prior to the meeting and only verbal advice was provided.; RESULTS: The pilot meeting took place in 2009. Each session lasted for approximately two hours and was structured around the questions in the briefing books. The representatives from the TGA and PBAC Secretariat provided well-informed, considered and careful advice for both compounds, which was predominantly actionable and practical.; DISCUSSION: The sessions proved highly informative and permitted better alignment of the possible positioning of new medicines with the clinical evidence that regulators and HTA agencies might subsequently require for favorable assessment. The process provided early and clear signals to inform major development investments and the probability of successful market access. A number of challenges need to be addressed before tripartite scientific advice can be provided on continual basis.

AB Effective pursuit of the science and management of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) relies on the mutual understanding of the perspectives of, and collaboration among, the various stakeholders in health care. In this article, we compare, contrast, and endeavor to find areas of alignment across the perspectives of three such stakeholders -regulators, the biopharmaceutical and device industry, and U.S. payers. First, we discuss how evidence of HTE is generated and could be improved upon. For pharmaceuticals, much of the initial research is conducted by the pharmaceutical industry, guided by basic science but also delimited by potential markets, regulatory approval requirements, trial size considerations, and payer expectations for evidence of value. Once a drug is marketed, further evidence can be generated via combining trial data, conducting meta-analysis, and analyzing real-world results through observational research designs; we explore how these efforts can benefit from cooperation across these stakeholders. Second, we discuss the equally important utilization of HTE evidence so that physicians and patients have access to and can benefit from the learnings from this research. Research findings must be translated into actionable information and guidelines that can be incorporated into everyday practice. Doing so requires interaction and collaboration among all involved, based on facilitated communication as well as further evaluation research. We provide examples of several cross-sectorial initiatives that are under way in this area. Finally, we explore some economic aspects of HTE research as part of the drug development, marketing, and treatment process. Understanding the economic incentives present is fundamental to aligning those incentives to improve the availability and utilization of HTE evidence. Clear understandings among regulators, pharma, and payers about high-value targets, methods to efficiently generate and communicate information, and value propositions can lead to "win-win" scenarios for patients, individual payers, the health care system overall, and the future of drug development in producing new medicines.

AB Personalized medicine has the potential to revolutionize patient care. In order to do so, it requires a re-engineering of many life sciences and healthcare processes, the most significant being the integration of the complete biomarker lifecycle from discovery to targeted treatment of patients. Individual patient omic profiles have become a reality owing to the diminishing cost of DNA sequencing. However, managing these data has created a bottleneck due to: the limitations in storage, computing power and information access; the lack of biologist-friendly software to replace the user-unfriendly custom scripts, which are crippling collaboration; the urgency for standardizing data across omics and clinical data realms for cross-study comparisons; undermining innovations of enterprise and open-source software, which saps innovations of open-source and reliability and support of enterprise software; and unavailability of a robust, integrative workflow system, which leads to actionable data at the patient care level.

AB RATIONALE: Understanding the quality of life of lung cancer screening program participants, and the impact of program participation on quality of life and healthcare use, will help in the assessment of the value of screening.; OBJECTIVES: Determine the quality of life of participants in a lung cancer screening study and assess the effect of an abnormal screening finding on quality of life and healthcare use.; METHODS: Quality-of-life measures and data on the use of healthcare services were collected prospectively during a randomized controlled lung cancer screening trial using chest radiography with computer-aided detection. Comparisons of baseline measures were made with U.S. population norms for the EuroQol 5-Dimension index. The impact of receiving a message of the presence of a lung nodule was assessed for all measures.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1,424 subjects participated. Twenty-five actionable nodules were reported. Baseline EuroQol 5-Dimension index scores were higher than U.S. population norms (P < 0.0001). The EuroQol 5-Dimension index score and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire symptom score showed a significant change toward poorer quality of life after notification of the presence of a lung nodule (0.940 vs. 0.877, P = 0.022, and 25.7 vs. 34.0, P = 0.005, respectively). Chest imaging within 6 months of the screening examination occurred more frequently in those notified of a lung nodule (25.5 vs. 9.3%, P = 0.002).; CONCLUSIONS: Those who choose to enter a lung cancer screening program have a high baseline quality of life. The report of an abnormal screening finding can lower the quality of life and lead to increased chest imaging. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01663155).

AB BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for efficient, equitable interventions across the disease spectrum from prevention to palliative care. To identify and prioritize such interventions, evidence of effectiveness important to potential constituents is needed on outcomes relevant to them.; METHODS: To inform practice and policy, evidence is needed on actionable, harmonized outcomes which are feasible to collect in most settings and relevant to citizens, practitioners, and decision makers. We propose that increased priority should be given to certain outcomes that are infrequently collected across multiple domains.; RESULTS: A modification of a logic model of health outcomes by Proctor et al. is used to propose key domains and measures of implementation, service delivery, biomarkers, and health and functioning outcomes. Recommendations are made to give increased priority to implementation (especially reach, resource requirements/costs; and fidelity/adaptation); Institute of Medicine service delivery categories of equity and safety; and patient reported health and functioning outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: Implications of this outcomes framework include that biomarkers are not always the most important or relevant outcomes; that harmonized, pragmatic, and actionable measures are needed for each of these types of outcomes, and that significant changes in training and review of grants and publications are needed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The taxonomy and management of carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) has matured over the past decade with the use of sophisticated imaging and pathologic tools. In the era of tailored therapeutics, this presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Tissue-of-origin (ToO) molecular profiling has an important role in the diagnostic armamentarium of CUP cancers, and its niche continues to evolve with ongoing prospective studies. Despite the inability to conduct direct validation (i.e., primary tumor), the use of the indirect validation methods with immunohistochemistry (IHC), imaging, and treatment response has allowed us to evaluate the performance accuracy of ToO profiling assays in CUP cancers. Despite advances, we struggle with the undifferentiated neoplasms, which often remain unclassifiable after an exhaustive use of IHC and ToO profiling assays. Genomic characterization of these and other select CUP cancers using next-generation sequencing techniques may reveal actionable biomarkers outside the (tissue specific) cellular framework. Also, going forward, using data from comparative effectiveness research, one could envision using a streamlined, cost-effective algorithm that integrates IHC and ToO molecular profiling in patients with limited (or difficult-to-access) biopsies and difficult-to-diagnose cancers. ©2013 AACR.

AB Gastric cancer is the second leading cancer cause of death globally. Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

AB PURPOSE: Clinical whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing will result in a broad range of incidental findings, but clinicians' obligations to identify and disclose such findings are a matter of debate. We sought legal cases that could offer insights into clinicians' legal liability.; METHODS: We searched for cases in which incidental findings were related to the cause of action, using the search engines WestLaw, WestLaw Next, Lexis, and Lexis Advance.; RESULTS: We found no case law related to incidental findings from genetic testing but identified eight cases involving incidental findings in medical imaging. These cases suggest that clinicians may face liability for failing to disclose incidental findings that would have offered an opportunity for interventions to improve health outcome, if under the applicable standard of care, they fail to identify or appreciate the significance of the incidental finding or they negligently fail to notify other clinicians and/or the patient of the identified incidental finding. Other cases support liability for failure to refer appropriately to a clinician with greater expertise.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians may face liability if they fail to disclose incidental information that could inform interventions to improve health outcome; information lacking clinical actionability is likely to have less import.

AB OBJECTIVE: We describe how ehealth communication programs can be improved by using artificial intelligence (AI) to increase immediacy.; METHODS: We analyzed major deficiencies in ehealth communication programs, illustrating how programs often fail to fully engage audiences and can even have negative consequences by undermining the effective delivery of information intended to guide health decision-making and influence adoption of health-promoting behaviors. We examined the use of AI in ehealth practices to promote immediacy and provided examples from the ChronologyMD project.; RESULTS: Strategic use of AI is shown to help enhance immediacy in ehealth programs by making health communication more engaging, relevant, exciting, and actionable.; CONCLUSION: AI can enhance the "immediacy" of ehealth by humanizing health promotion efforts, promoting physical and emotional closeness, increasing authenticity and enthusiasm in health promotion efforts, supporting personal involvement in communication interactions, increasing exposure to relevant messages, reducing demands on healthcare staff, improving program efficiency, and minimizing costs.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: User-centered AI approaches, such as the use of personally involving verbal and nonverbal cues, natural language translation, virtual coaches, and comfortable human-computer interfaces can promote active information processing and adoption of new ideas. Immediacy can improve information access, trust, sharing, motivation, and behavior changes. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pragmatic measures are important to facilitate implementation and dissemination, address stakeholder issues, and drive quality improvement. This paper proposes necessary and recommended criteria for pragmatic measures, provides examples of projects to develop and identify such measures, addresses potential concerns about these recommendations, and identifies areas for future research and application. Key criteria for pragmatic measures include importance to stakeholders in addition to researchers, low burden, broad applicability, sensitivity to change, and being actionable. Examples of pragmatic measures are provided, including ones for different settings (e.g., primary care, hospital) and levels (e.g., individual, practitioner, setting) that illustrate approaches to produce broad-scale dissemination and the development of brief, standardized measures for use in pragmatic studies. There is an important need for pragmatic measures to facilitate pragmatic research, guide quality improvement, and inform progress on public health goals, but few examples are currently available. Development and evaluation of pragmatic measures and metrics would provide useful resources to advance science, policy, and practice.  Copyright © 2013.

AB INTRODUCTION: Arrhythmia monitoring in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is challenging. Transtelephonic monitors (TTMs) are cumbersome to use and provide limited temporal assessment. Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) may overcome these limitations. We sought to evaluate the utility of ILRs versus conventional monitoring (CM) in patients undergoing AF ablation.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-four patients undergoing AF ablation received ILRs and CM (30-day TTM at discharge and months 5 and 11 postablation). Over the initial 6 months, clinical decisions were made based on CM. Subjects were then randomized for the remaining 6 months to arrhythmia assessment and management by ILR versus CM. The primary endpoint was arrhythmia recurrence. The secondary endpoint was actionable clinical events (change of antiarrhythmic drugs [AADs], anticoagulation, non-AF arrhythmia events, etc.) due to either monitoring strategy. Over the study period, 6 patients withdrew. In the first 6 months, AF recurred in 18 patients (7 noted by CM, 18 by ILR; P = 0.002). Five patients in the CM (28%) and 5 in the ILR arm (25%; P = NS) had AF recurrence during the latter 6 months. AF was falsely diagnosed frequently by ILR (730 of 1,421 episodes; 51%). In more patients in the ILR compared with the CM arm, rate control agents (60% vs 39%, P = 0.02) and AADs (71% vs 44%, P = 0.04) were discontinued.; CONCLUSION: In AF ablation patients, ILR can detect more arrhythmias than CM. However, false detection remains a challenge. With adequate oversight, ILRs may be useful in monitoring these patients after ablation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: A distributed research network (DRN) of electronic health care databases, in which data reside behind the firewall of each data partner, can support a wide range of comparative effectiveness research (CER) activities. An essential component of a fully functional DRN is the capability to perform robust statistical analyses to produce valid, actionable evidence without compromising patient privacy, data security, or proprietary interests.; OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We describe the strengths and limitations of different confounding adjustment approaches that can be considered in observational CER studies conducted within DRNs, and the theoretical and practical issues to consider when selecting among them in various study settings.; RESULTS: Several methods can be used to adjust for multiple confounders simultaneously, either as individual covariates or as confounder summary scores (eg, propensity scores and disease risk scores), including: (1) centralized analysis of patient-level data, (2) case-centered logistic regression of risk set data, (3) stratified or matched analysis of aggregated data, (4) distributed regression analysis, and (5) meta-analysis of site-specific effect estimates. These methods require different granularities of information be shared across sites and afford investigators different levels of analytic flexibility.; CONCLUSIONS: DRNs are growing in use and sharing of highly detailed patient-level information is not always feasible in DRNs. Methods that incorporate confounder summary scores allow investigators to adjust for a large number of confounding factors without the need to transfer potentially identifiable information in DRNs. They have the potential to let investigators perform many analyses traditionally conducted through a centralized dataset with detailed patient-level information.

AB Increased hepatic lipid content is an early correlate of insulin resistance and can be caused by nutrient-induced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor). This activation of mTor increases basal Akt activity, leading to a self-perpetuating lipogenic cycle. We have previously shown that the developmental Notch pathway has metabolic functions in adult mouse liver. Acute or chronic inhibition of Notch dampens hepatic glucose production and increases Akt activity and may therefore be predicted to increase hepatic lipid content. Here we now show that constitutive liver-specific ablation of Notch signaling, or its acute inhibition with a decoy Notch1 receptor, prevents hepatosteatosis by blocking mTor complex 1 (mTorc1) activity. Conversely, Notch gain of function causes fatty liver through constitutive activation of mTorc1, an effect that is reversible by treatment with rapamycin. We demonstrate that Notch signaling increases mTorc1 complex stability, augmenting mTorc1 function and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenesis. These data identify Notch as a therapeutically actionable branch point of metabolic signaling at which Akt activation in the liver can be uncoupled from hepatosteatosis.

AB Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in our society, with a mortality that virtually parallels its incidence, a median survival of <12 months even with maximal therapy, and a 5-year survival rate of <5 %. The diversity of clinical outcomes and the molecular heterogeneity of histopathologically similar cancer types, incomplete knowledge of the genomic aberrations that drive carcinogenesis and the lack of therapeutics that specifically target most known genomic aberrations necessitates large-scale detailed analysis of cancer genomes to identify novel potential therapeutic strategies. As part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (APGI) used exomic sequencing and copy number analysis to define genomic aberrations that characterize a large, clinically focused, prospectively accrued cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer. The cohort consisted of early (clinical stages I and II) non-pre-treated patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent operative resection with curative intent. We devised approaches to adjust for low epithelial content in primary tumours and to define the genomic landscape of pancreatic cancer to identify novel candidate driver genes and mechanisms. We aim to develop stratified, molecular phenotype-guided therapeutic strategies using existing therapeutics that are either rescued, repurposed, in development, or are known to be effective in an undefined subgroup of PC patients. These are then tested in primary patient-derived xenografts and cell lines from the above deeply characterized cohort. In addition, we return information to treating clinicians that influences patient care and are launching a clinical trial called IMPaCT (Individualized Molecular Pancreatic Cancer Therapy). This umbrella design trial randomizes patients with metastatic disease to either standard first-line therapy with gemcitabine, or a molecular phenotype-guided approach using next-generation sequencing strategies to screen for actionable mutations defined through the ICGC effort.  © 2013 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery.

AB In the airway tract acetylcholine (ACh) is known to be the mediator of the parasympathetic nervous system. However ACh is also synthesized by a large variety of non-neuronal cells. Strongest expression is documented in neuroendocrine and in epithelial cells (ciliated, basal and secretory elements). Growing evidence suggests that a cell-type specific Ach expression and release do exist and act with local autoparacrine loop in the non-neuronal airway compartment. Here we review the molecular mechanism by which Ach is involved in regulating various aspects of innate mucosal defense, including mucociliary clearance, regulation of macrophage activation as well as in promoting epithelial cells proliferation and conferring susceptibility to lung carcinoma onset. Importantly this non-neuronal cholinergic machinery is differently regulated than the neuronal one and could be specifically therapeutically targeted.

AB Approximately 70% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer present with late-stage disease and have limited treatment options, so there is a pressing need to develop efficacious targeted therapies for these patients. This remains a major challenge as the underlying genetic causes of ~50% of non-small-cell lung cancers remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that a targeted genetic dependency screen is an efficient approach to identify somatic cancer alterations that are functionally important. By using this approach, we have identified three kinases with gain-of-function mutations in lung cancer, namely FGFR4, MAP3K9, and PAK5. Mutations in these kinases are activating toward the ERK pathway, and targeted depletion of the mutated kinases inhibits proliferation, suppresses constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways, and results in specific killing of the lung cancer cells. Genomic profiling of patients with lung cancer is ushering in an era of personalized medicine; however, lack of actionable mutations presents a significant hurdle. Our study indicates that targeted genetic dependency screens will be an effective strategy to elucidate somatic variants that are essential for lung cancer cell viability.

AB BACKGROUND: The majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients develop some form of lower urinary tract dysfunction, usually as a result of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). Patients identify urinary incontinence as one of the worst aspects of this disease. Despite the high prevalence of NDO, urological evaluation and treatment are significantly under-accessed in this population. The objectives of this study were: 1) to adapt the previously validated Actionable Bladder Symptom Screening Tool (ABSST) to a short form for ease and brevity of application in a clinical setting that is clinically meaningful; and 2) to develop a scoring algorithm that would be interpretable in terms of referring/considering precise diagnosis and treatment.; METHODS: A US-based, non-randomized, multi-center, stand-alone observational study was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the ABSST among patients who have MS with and without NDO. Mixed psychometric methods (e.g., classical statistics (Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill; 1994) and item response methods (Applying the Rasch Model: Fundamental Measurement in the Human Sciences. New Jersey: Lawrence Earlbaum Associates; 2001)) were used to evaluate the predictive and clinical validity of the shortened form. The latter included clinicians flagging clinically meaningful items and associated response options which would indicate the need for further evaluation or treatment.; RESULTS: A total of 151 patients, all with MS and with and without NDO, were recruited by 28 clinicians in various US geographical locations. Approximately 41% of patients reported a history of or currently having urinary incontinence and/or urinary urgency. The prediction model across the entire range of classification thresholds was evaluated, plotting the true positive identification rate against the false positive rate (1-Specificity) for various cut scores. In this study, the cut-point or total score of greater than or equal to 6 had a sensitivity of approximately 85%, and specificity of approximately 93% (i.e., 85% patients would warrant being referred to a urologist and 93% of the patients whose symptoms would not warrant urologist referral).; CONCLUSIONS: Overall the short form ABSST demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as it maintained the integrity of the longer form tool. Concurrent validity for each subscale as well as predictive and concurrent validity of the total shortened instrument was demonstrated. This instrument provides a new method for assessing bladder problems among MS patients, and may facilitate earlier and more precise diagnosis, treatment, and/or referral to a specialist.

AB SUMMARY: Two studies published in this issue of Cancer Discovery describe the emerging mutational landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and their genomic and epigenetic alterations, thus identifying novel actionable cancer drivers and predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies. Most genomic alterations in HNSCC converge in a handful of molecular pathways, resulting in cell-cycle deregulation, genomic instability, cell differentiation defects, and persistent mitogenic signaling, the latter involving aberrant phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway activation, thereby rendering HNSCC responsive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many driver mutations that determine the malignant behavior of lung cancer have been identified in recent years. The promise of therapies targeted to the specific molecular pathways altered by such mutations has made genetic testing in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) attractive to clinicians. We reviewed recent research on clinically relevant genetic and molecular tests for patients with NSCLC, with an emphasis on the tests linked to actionable mutations that influence therapy and improve outcomes.; RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) and translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been shown to be common driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma. The presence or absence of these mutations has been demonstrated to predict response to targeted therapy in many recent studies. Targeted therapies for patients with mutations in the EGFR domain or the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation have been shown to be effective and are approved for use. Ongoing studies continue to define the extent of their utility and may continue to expand their indications. Sufficient tissue for genetic analysis can be obtained from cytologic samples, including those obtained from endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.; SUMMARY: Genetic testing for driver mutations is useful in identifying patients with NSCLC who are likely to respond to targeted therapy. These tests are best used in patients with adenocarcinoma who have advanced-stage cancer.

AB AIMS: The HomeGuide Registry was a prospective study (NCT01459874), implementing a model for remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in daily clinical practice, to estimate effectiveness in major cardiovascular event detection and management.; METHODS AND RESULTS: The workflow for remote monitoring [Biotronik Home Monitoring (HM)] was based on primary nursing: each patient was assigned to an expert nurse for management and to a responsible physician for medical decisions. In-person visits were scheduled once a year. Seventy-five Italian sites enrolled 1650 patients [27% pacemakers, 27% single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), 22% dual-chamber ICDs, 24% ICDs with cardiac resynchronization therapy]. Population resembled the expected characteristics of CIED patients. During a 20 ± 13 month follow-up, 2471 independently adjudicated events were collected in 838 patients (51%): 2033 (82%) were detected during HM sessions; 438 (18%) during in-person visits. Sixty were classified as false-positive, with generalized estimating equation-adjusted sensitivity and positive predictive value of 84.3% [confidence interval (CI), 82.5-86.0%] and 97.4% (CI, 96.5-98.2%), respectively. Overall, 95% of asymptomatic and 73% of actionable events were detected during HM sessions. Median reaction time was 3 days [interquartile range (IQR), 1-14 days]. Generalized estimating equation-adjusted incremental utility, calculated according to four properties of major clinical interest, was in favour of the HM sessions: +0.56 (CI, 0.53-0.58%), P < 0.0001. Resource consumption: 3364 HM sessions performed (76% by nurses), median committed monthly manpower of 55.5 (IQR, 22.0-107.0) min * health personnel/100 patients.; CONCLUSION: Home Monitoring was highly effective in detecting and managing clinical events in CIED patients in daily practice with remarkably low manpower and resource consumption.

AB Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive tumor characterized by genetic complexity, rapid doubling time, and early development of disseminated disease. Unfortunately, few chemotherapeutic advances have been made in the treatment of extensive-stage disease, and cisplatin/etoposide has remained the standard of care for more than 30 years. Other regimens with comparable efficacy include cisplatin/irinotecan and carboplatin/etoposide. Each of these combinations is associated with a different toxicity profile that must be considered when selecting an initial regimen. Several strategies, including maintenance chemotherapy, 3-drug combinations, alternating combination chemotherapy regimens, and high-dose chemotherapy, have consistently failed to demonstrate improvements in survival when compared with 4 to 6 cycles of platinum doublets. Several options are available for patients who experience progression during or relapse after induction therapy, although topotecan is the only FDA-approved agent for second-line treatment. Recently, scientific efforts have identified potentially actionable genetic alterations in small cell tumors that may lead to the development of effective, targeted therapies.

AB New strategies to facilitate the improvement of physical and integrated biological optimization of high-precision treatment protocols are an important priority for modern radiation oncology. From a clinical perspective, as knowledge accumulates from molecular radiobiology, there is a complex and exciting opportunity to investigate novel approaches to rational patient treatment stratification based on actionable tumor targets, together with the appropriate design of next-generation early-phase radiotherapy trials utilizing targeted therapeutics, to formally evaluate relevant clinical and biomarker endpoints. A unique aspect in the development pathway of systemic agents with presumed radiosensitizing activity will also be the need for special attention on patient eligibility and the rigorous definition of radiation dose-volume relationships and potential dose-limiting toxicities. Based on recent experience from systematically investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors as radiosensitizing agents, from initial studies in preclinical tumor models through the conduct of a phase I clinical study to evaluate tumor activity of the targeted agent as well as patient safety and tumor response to the combined treatment modality, this communication will summarize principles relating to early clinical evaluation of combining radiotherapy and targeted therapeutics.

AB Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have issued new guidance for industry on drug interaction studies, which outline comprehensive recommendations on a broad range of in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential. This paper aims to provide an overview of these new recommendations and an in-depth scientifically based perspective on issues surrounding some of the recommended approaches in emerging areas, particularly, transporters and complex DDIs. We present a number of theoretical considerations and several case examples to demonstrate complexities in applying (1) the proposed transporter decision trees and associated criteria for studying a broad spectrum of transporters to derive actionable information and (2) the recommended model-based approaches at an early stage of drug development to prospectively predict DDIs involving time-dependent inhibition and mixed inhibition/induction of drug metabolizing enzymes. We hope to convey the need for conducting DDI studies on a case-by-case basis using a holistic scientifically based interrogative approach and to communicate the need for additional research to fill in knowledge gaps in these areas where the science is rapidly evolving to better ensure the safety and efficacy of new therapeutic agents.

AB A crisis continues to brew within the pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) enterprise: productivity continues declining as costs rise, despite ongoing, often dramatic scientific and technical advances. To reverse this trend, we offer various suggestions for both the expansion and broader adoption of modeling and simulation (M&S) methods. We suggest strategies and scenarios intended to enable new M&S use cases that directly engage R&D knowledge generation and build actionable mechanistic insight, thereby opening the door to enhanced productivity. What M&S requirements must be satisfied to access and open the door, and begin reversing the productivity decline? Can current methods and tools fulfill the requirements, or are new methods necessary? We draw on the relevant, recent literature to provide and explore answers. In so doing, we identify essential, key roles for agent-based and other methods. We assemble a list of requirements necessary for M&S to meet the diverse needs distilled from a collection of research, review, and opinion articles. We argue that to realize its full potential, M&S should be actualized within a larger information technology framework--a dynamic knowledge repository--wherein models of various types execute, evolve, and increase in accuracy over time. We offer some details of the issues that must be addressed for such a repository to accrue the capabilities needed to reverse the productivity decline. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Community resilience (CR)--ability to withstand and recover from a disaster--is a national policy expectation that challenges health departments to merge disaster preparedness and community health promotion and to build stronger partnerships with organizations outside government, yet guidance is limited. A baseline survey documented community resilience-building barriers and facilitators for health department and community-based organization (CBO) staff. Questions focused on CBO engagement, government-CBO partnerships, and community education. Most health department staff and CBO members devoted minimal time to community disaster preparedness though many serve populations that would benefit. Respondents observed limited CR activities to activate in a disaster. The findings highlighted opportunities for engaging communities in disaster preparedness and informed the development of a community action plan and toolkit.

AB Here we report an integrated analysis that leverages data from treatment of genetic mouse models of prostate cancer along with clinical data from patients to elucidate new mechanisms of castration resistance. We show that castration counteracts tumor progression in a Pten loss-driven mouse model of prostate cancer through the induction of apoptosis and proliferation block. Conversely, this response is bypassed with deletion of either Trp53 or Zbtb7a together with Pten, leading to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Mechanistically, the integrated acquisition of data from mouse models and patients identifies the expression patterns of XAF1, XIAP and SRD5A1 as a predictive and actionable signature for CRPC. Notably, we show that combined inhibition of XIAP, SRD5A1 and AR pathways overcomes castration resistance. Thus, our co-clinical approach facilitates the stratification of patients and the development of tailored and innovative therapeutic treatments.

AB Ebola viruses remain a substantial threat to both civilian and military populations as bioweapons, during sporadic outbreaks, and from the possibility of accidental importation from endemic regions by infected individuals. Currently, no approved therapeutics exist to treat or prevent infection by Ebola viruses. Therefore, we performed an in vitro screen of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- and ex-US-approved drugs and selected molecular probes to identify drugs with antiviral activity against the type species Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). From this screen, we identified a set of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including clomiphene and toremifene, which act as potent inhibitors of EBOV infection. Anti-EBOV activity was confirmed for both of these SERMs in an in vivo mouse infection model. This anti-EBOV activity occurred even in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression, and both SERMs inhibited virus entry after internalization, suggesting that clomiphene and toremifene are not working through classical pathways associated with the estrogen receptor. Instead, the response appeared to be an off-target effect where the compounds interfere with a step late in viral entry and likely affect the triggering of fusion. These data support the screening of readily available approved drugs to identify therapeutics for the Ebola viruses and other infectious diseases. The SERM compounds described in this report are an immediately actionable class of approved drugs that can be repurposed for treatment of filovirus infections.

AB Antibiotics are one of the most important medical discoveries of the 20th century and will remain an essential tool for treating animal and human diseases in the 21st century. However, antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens and concerns over their extensive use in food animals has garnered global interest in limiting antibiotic use in animal agriculture. Yet, limiting the availability of medical interventions to prevent and control animal diseases on the farm will directly impact global food security and safety as well as animal and human health. Insufficient attention has been given to the scientific breakthroughs and novel technologies that provide alternatives to antibiotics. The objectives of the symposium 'Alternatives to Antibiotics' were to highlight promising research results and novel technologies that could potentially lead to alternatives to conventional antibiotics, and assess challenges associated with their commercialization, and provide actionable strategies to support development of alternative antimicrobials. The symposium focused on the latest scientific breakthroughs and technologies that could provide new options and alternative strategies for preventing and treating diseases of animals. Some of these new technologies have direct applications as medical interventions for human health, but the focus of the symposium was animal production, animal health and food safety during food-animal production. Five subject areas were explored in detail through scientific presentations and expert panel discussions, including: (1) alternatives to antibiotics, lessons from nature; (2) immune modulation approaches to enhance disease resistance and to treat animal diseases; (3) gut microbiome and immune development, health and diseases; (4) alternatives to antibiotics for animal production; and (5) regulatory pathways to enable the licensure of alternatives to antibiotics.

AB Gastric cancer is the second leading cancer cause of death globally. Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will focus on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will devoted to gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.

AB There is a glaring gap in the psychiatric literature concerning the nature of psychiatric symptoms and signs, and a corresponding lack of epistemological discussion of psycho-diagnostic interviewing. Contemporary clinical neuroscience heavily relies on the use of fully structured interviews that are historically rooted in logical positivism and behaviorism. These theoretical approaches marked decisively the so-called "operational revolution in psychiatry" leading to the creation of DSM-III. This paper attempts to examine the theoretical assumptions that underlie the use of a fully structured psychiatric interview. We address the ontological status of pathological experience, the notions of symptom, sign, prototype and Gestalt, and the necessary second-person processes which are involved in converting the patient's experience (originally lived in the first-person perspective) into an "objective" (third person), actionable format, used for classification, treatment, and research. Our central thesis is that psychiatry targets the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects. We claim that in order to perform faithful distinctions in this particular domain, we need a more adequate approach, that is, an approach that is guided by phenomenologically informed considerations. Our theoretical discussion draws upon clinical examples derived from structured and semi-structured interviews. We conclude that fully structured interview is neither theoretically adequate nor practically valid in obtaining psycho-diagnostic information. Failure to address these basic issues may have contributed to the current state of malaise in the study of psychopathology.

AB PURPOSE: Admission rapid thrombelastography (rTEG) is a "real-time" clinical tool used to evaluate trauma-induced coagulopathy and direct hemostatic resuscitation. The relationship of rTEG to conventional coagulation tests (CCT) and early lifesaving interventions (LSI) in pediatric trauma is unknown.; METHODS: Severely injured patients (age ≤ 14 years) with an rTEG were retrospectively reviewed (8/1/2009-8/31/2011). Demographic and clinical information was collected. Spearman's correlation and regression models were used to evaluate rTEG with respect to CCT, early transfusion, LSI, and mortality.; RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were identified. The median age was 8 years, and the median injury severity score (ISS) was 21. Activated clotting time (r=0.68), k-time (r=0.77), and alpha-angle (r=-0.75) showed strong correlation to PTT, and maximum amplitude (MA) (r=0.46) showed good correlation to platelet count (all p<0.001). When controlling for age, gender, and ISS, regression analysis showed that ACT, r-value, k-time, alpha-angle, and MA predicted red blood cell and plasma transfusion within 6h. MA (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96; p=0.018) was predictive of LSI. All rTEG values, except for LY30, predicted mortality.; CONCLUSION: Admission rTEG correlates with CCT and predicts early transfusion, early LSI, and outcome in pediatric trauma. rTEG provides valuable data for goal-directed hemostatic resuscitation of critically injured children.

AB Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) of the lung is the second-largest subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), causing an estimated 400,000 deaths per year worldwide. Recent developments in cancer genome sequencing technology expanded our knowledge of driver mutations, which were identified as novel candidates for targeted therapy in various cancers. Successful targeted treatments for lung adenocarcinoma, NSCLC's primary subtype, with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion are clinically available, and a clinical trial of personalized targeted therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma is underway by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium. Although there are targeted treatments for lung adenocarcinoma, no personalized therapies currently exist for SQCC. Recently, comprehensive genomic characterization of lung SQCC using massively parallel sequencing has enabled us to identify several potential driver mutations/signaling pathways. These are FGFR1 amplifications, PI3KCA mutations, PTEN mutations/deletions, PDGFRA amplifications/mutations, and DDR2 mutations. The march toward personalized therapy may have taken a step forward with the discovery of these potential biomarkers for the treatment of SQCC of the lung. This article reviewed the current knowledge of genomic landscape of lung SQCC and summarized ongoing clinical trials of targeted agents for lung SQCC. Also, we will suggest several other actionable mutations with matching drugs that should be investigated in future clinical trials for the personalized treatment of lung SQCC. Crown Copyright © 2013.

AB BACKGROUND: Thymomas and thymic carcinoma are rare tumors with no approved therapies. Our purpose was to analyze the molecular features and outcomes of patients referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Clinic).; METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive referred patients with advanced/metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma; RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified (median age 52 years; 10 women; median number of prior systemic therapies = 2). Six of 10 patients (60%) treated with mTOR inhibitor combination regimens achieved stable disease (SD) ≥12 months or a partial response (PR). For patients treated on mTOR inhibitor regimens (N = 10), median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 11.6 months versus 2.3 months on last conventional regimen prior to referral (p=0.024). Molecular analyses (performed by next generation sequencing in seven patients and single polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays in an additional six patients) showed diverse actionable mutations: PIK3CA (1 of 12 tested; 8%); EGFR (1 of 13; 8%); RET (1 of 7; 14%); and AKT1 (1 of 7; 14%). Of two patients with PIK3CA or AKT1 mutations, one was treated with an mTOR inhibitor-based regimen and achieved 26% regression with a TTF of 17 months.; CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced/metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma demonstrated prolonged TTF on mTOR inhibitor-based therapy as compared to prior conventional treatment. Heterogeneity in actionable molecular aberrations was observed, suggesting that multi-assay molecular profiling and individualizing treatment merits investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) alone or combined with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-Ds) featuring automatic home monitoring (HM) function can be monitored remotely on a daily basis. Different ways of implementing HM into clinical routines are possible, with efficient patient management being the main objective. In this study, a concept using a telemedical service center (TmSC) to manage HM data was developed and investigated regarding patients' satisfaction, physicians' satisfaction, and alert filtering.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five ICD or CRT-D patients with symptomatic heart failure were enrolled. The TmSC received HM data, identified "actionable parameters" (APs) by following protocol-defined procedures, conducted structured patient interviews, and forwarded selected APs to the respective follow-up clinic. Satisfaction of patients and physicians with the TmSC was evaluated at the end of the study by purpose-designed questionnaires.; RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 402±200 days, 3,831 APs were identified and analyzed at the TmSC (5.28 per patient-month). Most APs were triggered by a pilot detection algorithm for worsening heart failure (2.80 per patient-month), followed by atrial tachyarrhythmia episodes (1.10 per patient-month) and ventricular pacing issues (0.87 per patient-month). The TmSC forwarded 682 APs (18% of all APs) to 10 study sites. Approximately 65% of physicians and patients deemed the TmSC improved patient care.; CONCLUSIONS: The TmSC-based management concept was well accepted and appreciated by the majority of physicians and patients. It may be helpful in gaining symptomatic information on top of automatic HM data and in supporting smaller clinics in the follow-up of their device patients.

AB BACKGROUND:  Actionable feedback targeted to the learner's needs is one of the strongest predictors of improved performance in learning. Unfortunately, when a trainee makes an error, although instructors may understand what a trainee has done wrong, they can erroneously assume they know why.; CONTEXT:  There is a growing recognition that cognitive biases impede clinical diagnosis, however, the same biases can also undermine accurate and effective feedback.; INNOVATION:  Instead of focusing primarily on correcting actions, it is often crucial to diagnose trainees' 'frames'-- the thought processes that drive their actions. We offer an efficient three-step algorithm for providing this 'frame-based' feedback: (1) describe how the trainee is doing according to the instructor; (2) diagnose the trainee's immediate learning needs using inquiry to elicit their frame; and (3) direct instruction to those needs.; IMPLICATIONS:  'Misdiagnosis' of the trainee's actual needs wastes time when instructors teaching unneeded material, diminishes the trainee's faith in the value of instruction and undermines patient safety when incorrect frames about important clinical processes persist. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: The growth of consumer-directed health plans has sparked increased demand for information regarding the cost and quality of healthcare services, including total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However, the factors that influence patients' choice of provider when pursuing elective orthopaedic care, such as TJA, are poorly understood.; QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We evaluated the factors patients consider when selecting an orthopaedic surgeon and hospital for TJA.; METHODS: Two hundred fifty-one patients who sought treatment from either an academic or community-based orthopaedic practice for primary TJA completed a 37-item survey using a 5-point Likert scale rating ("unimportant" to "very important") regarding seven established clinical and nonclinical dimensions of care patients considered when selecting a provider and hospital.; RESULT: Patients rated physician manner (average Likert, 4.7) and physician quality (eg, outcomes) (average Likert, 4.6) as most important in their selection of surgeon and hospital for TJA. Despite the expressed importance of surgeon and hospital quality, only 46% of patients were able to find useful information to compare outcomes among surgeons, and 47% for hospitals that perform TJA.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest physician manner and surgical outcomes are the most important considerations for patients when choosing a provider for elective TJA. Cost sharing is the least important criterion patients considered. Patients expressed high motivation to seek out provider quality information but indicated accessible and actionable sources of information are lacking. Future efforts should be directed at developing clinically relevant, easily interpretable, objective, risk-adjusted measures of physician and hospital quality.

AB OBJECTIVE: A major goal of patient-centered outcomes and comparative effectiveness research is to increase the involvement of stakeholders throughout the research process to provide relevant and immediately actionable information. In this report, we review the current practices for engaging stakeholders in prioritizing research.; STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: To evaluate the range of approaches to stakeholder engagement, we reviewed the relevant literature and conducted semistructured interviews with (1) leading research organizations in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom; and (2) eight Evidence-based Practice Centers that engage stakeholders in comparative effectiveness research.; RESULTS: We identified 56 articles related to stakeholder engagement in research prioritization. Studies and research organizations interviewed frequently used mixed methods approaches combining in-person venues with structured ranking or voting processes such as Delphi. EPCs similarly used group web/conference calls combined with Delphi ranking or voting. Research organizations reported difficulties engaging the public and policy makers, and EPCs reported challenges engaging federal stakeholders.; CONCLUSION: Explicit and consistent use of terminology about stakeholders was absent. In-person techniques were useful to generate ideas and clarify issues, and quantitative methods were important in the prioritization of research. Recommendations for effective stakeholder engagement and a reporting checklist were developed from the accumulation of findings. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare and heterogeneous subtype of breast carcinoma with a generally poor outcome, and few therapeutic options once disease recurs or progresses. Metaplastic carcinomas of the breast are usually of a larger size at diagnosis, with less frequent nodal metastasis compared with invasive ductal carcinoma no special type, and lack hormone and HER2 receptor expression. Recent research has revealed some potentially actionable genetic changes in a subset of these rare tumours. However, ongoing efforts to further characterise the genetic basis and the molecular alterations underlying the distinctive morphological and clinical characteristics of these tumours are needed in order to identify new targets for treatment. This review will describe the theories of pathogenesis of metaplastic breast carcinoma, and highlight genetic changes and potential therapeutic targets in this generally poor prognosis malignancy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Incorporating accurate life expectancy predictions into clinical decision making could improve quality and decrease costs, but few providers do this. We sought to use predictive data mining and high dimensional analytics of electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a highly accurate and clinically actionable 5 year life expectancy index.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the index using EHR data for 7463 patients ≥50 years old with ≥1 visit(s) in 2003 to a large, academic, multispecialty group practice. We extracted 980 attributes from the EHRs of the practices and affiliated hospitals. Correlation feature selection with greedy stepwise search was used to find the attribute subset with best average merit. Rotation forest ensembling with alternating decision tree as underlying classifier was used to predict 5 year mortality. Model performance was compared with the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Walter life expectancy method.; RESULTS: Within 5 years of the last visit in 2003, 838 (11%) patients had died. The final model included 24 attributes: two demographic (age, sex), 10 comorbidity (eg, cardiovascular disease), one vital sign (mean diastolic blood pressure), two medications (loop diuretic use, digoxin use), six laboratory (eg, mean albumin), and three healthcare utilization (eg, the number of hospitalizations 1 year prior to the last visit in 2003). The index showed very good discrimination (c-statistic 0.86) and outperformed comparators.; CONCLUSIONS: The EHR based index successfully distinguished adults ≥50 years old with life expectancy >5 years from those with life expectancy ≤5 years. This information could be used clinically to optimize preventive service use (eg, cancer screening in the elderly).

AB The economic and human cost of suicidal behavior to individuals, families, communities, and society makes suicide a serious public health concern, both in the US and around the world. As research and evaluation continue to identify strategies that have the potential to reduce or ultimately prevent suicidal behavior, the need for translating these findings into practice grows. The development of actionable knowledge is an emerging process for translating important research and evaluation findings into action to benefit practice settings. In an effort to apply evaluation findings to strengthen suicide prevention practice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) supported the development of three actionable knowledge products that make key findings and lessons learned from youth suicide prevention program evaluations accessible and useable for action. This paper describes the actionable knowledge framework (adapted from the knowledge transfer literature), the three products that resulted, and recommendations for further research into this emerging method for translating research and evaluation findings and bridging the knowledge-action gap.

AB BACKGROUND: There is insufficient documentation of the institutional frameworks for disaster management and resilience at different levels in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to describe the institutional framework for disaster management in Uganda, and to identify actionable gaps at the different levels.; METHODS: This was part of a multi-country assessment in which 6 countries in Eastern Africa developed and applied a common tool. The assessment was qualitative in nature employing a mixed methods approach including review of documents, interviews with key informants from agencies involved in disaster management in Uganda, group discussions with stakeholder and synthesis meetings of the assessment team.; FINDINGS: The Office of the Prime Minister is the lead agency for disaster management, but management of disasters of a technical nature is devolved to line ministries (e.g. epidemics by the Health Ministry and Epizootics by the Agriculture Ministry). A new policy spells out disaster management structures at national, district, sub-county, and village levels. Key challenges included coordination, more focus on prevention than risk reduction, differences in capacity between sectors and inadequate inter-sectoral collaboration. The new policy and structures have not yet been rolled out to districts and sub-district levels, and districts lack a line item budget for disaster capacity building.; CONCLUSIONS: The institutional framework for disaster management in Uganda needs to be strengthened at all levels through initiation of the relevant structures, training, and resource allocation so that they develop disaster management plans.

AB Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices improves device surveillance and patient clinical management. The greatest challenge in implementing remote monitoring in standard practice is the need to develop new organizational models, capable of combining clinical effectiveness, low resource consumption, and patient acceptance. Since 2005, we developed a new model based on 'Primary Nursing' in which each patient is assigned to a nurse responsible for continuity of care. The model is essentially based on a cooperative interaction between the roles of an expert reference nurse and a responsible physician with an agreed list of respective tasks and responsibilities. After a pilot experience, the model was tested in a wide registry, the HomeGuide Registry, in which 1650 patients were enrolled. In this setting, remote monitoring sensitivity in detecting major cardiovascular events was very high (84%) with a positive predictive value of 97%. Overall, 95% of asymptomatic and 73% of actionable events were detected during remote monitoring sessions with a median reaction time of 3 days. Manpower was remarkably low: 55.5 min per health personnel per month every 100 patients. The strongest points of this model include strict definition of workflow, early reaction, traceability, continuity of care, maintaining human relationship with the patient. This model has been tested successfully even in a multicentre setting in the Model Project Monitor Centre study, in which one monitor centre screened daily remote monitoring data from nine satellite clinics.

AB Demographic and technological changes are driving increased utilization of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) remote monitoring. In the USA, fee-for-service model of healthcare delivery, services rendered are valued based upon time, intensity, and technical or practice expense costs. As a consequence of this perspective, and to contain spending, Medicare has grouped physician services into families. Spending within each family of services must, by law, remain budget neutral. Cardiac implantable electronic devices monitoring services, remote and in-person, are grouped into one family. As the volume of services within this family increases, the individual encounters are destined to be discounted into ever decreasing portions. However, if the value of remote monitoring is demonstrated to extend beyond the previous boundaries of in-person interrogations, a rational request can be made to reconsider the relative value of remote monitoring. Outcome data supporting the value-added benefits of remote monitoring are rapidly accumulating, including (i) patient convenience, with reduced use of office services, (ii) equal safety compared with in-person evaluation, (iii) shorter detection time to actionable events (arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease progression, and device malfunction), (iv) reduced length of stay for hospitalizations, (v) reduced inappropriate shocks, (vi) increased battery longevity, and (vii) a relative reduction in the risk of death. Fully automatic wireless technology, only recently widely implemented, will add considerable clinical efficiencies and further increase the value of remote monitoring. The U.S. challenge will be to appropriately define the relative value of CIEDs remote monitoring now that outcome data have demonstrated its value extends beyond in-person interrogation.

AB IMPORTANCE: Preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), a common health care-associated infection, is important for improving the care of hospitalized patients and in meeting the goals for reduction of health care-associated infections set by the US Department of Health and Human Services.; OBJECTIVE: To identify ways to enhance CAUTI prevention efforts based on the experiences of hospitals participating in the Michigan Health and Hospital Association Keystone Center for Patient Safety statewide program to reduce unnecessary use of urinary catheters (the Bladder Bundle).; DESIGN: Qualitative assessment of data collected through semistructured telephone interviews with key informants at 12 hospitals and in-person interviews and site visits at 3 of the 12 hospitals. The analysis focused on perceptions and key issues identified by hospitals as influencing implementation of CAUTI prevention practices as recommended by the Bladder Bundle initiative.; SETTING: Twelve purposefully sampled hospitals in Michigan.; PARTICIPANTS: Key informants including infection preventionists, clinical personnel, and senior executives.; RESULTS: Common barriers to Bladder Bundle implementation and appropriate urinary catheter use included (1) difficulty with nurse and physician engagement, (2) patient and family request for indwelling catheters, and (3) catheter insertion practices and customs in the emergency department. Strategies to address these barriers were also identified by several of the participating hospitals, including (1) incorporating urinary management (eg, planned toileting) as part of other patient safety programs, such as a fall reduction program, (2) explicitly discussing the risks of indwelling urinary catheters with patients and families, and (3) engaging with emergency department nurses and physicians to implement a process that ensures that appropriate indications for catheter use are followed.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Bladder Bundle program provides a model for implementing strategies to reduce CAUTI. These findings provide actionable information to inform CAUTI prevention-related activities in hospitals throughout the country.

AB The scale of tumor genomic profiling is rapidly outpacing human cognitive capacity to make clinical decisions without the aid of tools. New frameworks are needed to help researchers and clinicians process the information emerging from the explosive growth in both the number of tumor genetic variants routinely tested and the respective knowledge to interpret their clinical significance. We review the current state, limitations, and future trends in methods to support the clinical analysis and interpretation of cancer genomes. This includes the processes of genome-scale variant identification, including tools for sequence alignment, tumor-germline comparison, and molecular annotation of variants. The process of clinical interpretation of tumor variants includes classification of the effect of the variant, reporting the results to clinicians, and enabling the clinician to make a clinical decision based on the genomic information integrated with other clinical features. We describe existing knowledge bases, databases, algorithms, and tools for identification and visualization of tumor variants and their actionable subsets. With the decreasing cost of tumor gene mutation testing and the increasing number of actionable therapeutics, we expect the methods for analysis and interpretation of cancer genomes to continue to evolve to meet the needs of patient-centered clinical decision making. The science of computational cancer medicine is still in its infancy; however, there is a clear need to continue the development of knowledge bases, best practices, tools, and validation experiments for successful clinical implementation in oncology.

AB Recent discoveries of genomic alterations that underlie and promote the malignant phenotype, together with an expanded repertoire of targeted agents, have provided many opportunities to conduct hypothesis-driven clinical trials. The ability to profile each unique cancer for actionable aberrations by using high-throughput technologies in a cost-effective way provides unprecedented opportunities for using matched therapies in a selected patient population. The major challenges are to integrate and make biologic sense of the substantial genomic data derived from multiple platforms. We define two different approaches for the analysis, interpretation, and clinical applicability of genomic data: (1) the genomically stratified model originates from the "one test-one drug" paradigm and is currently being expanded with an upfront multicategorical approach following recent advances in multiplexed genotyping platforms; and (2) the comprehensive assessment model is based on whole-genome, -exome, and -transcriptome data and allows identification of novel drivers and subsequent therapies in the experimental setting. Tumor heterogeneity and evolution of the diverse populations of cancer cells during cancer progression, influenced by the effects of systemic treatments, will need to be addressed in the new scenario of early drug development. Logistical issues related to prescreening strategies and trial allocation, in addition to concerns in the economic and ethical domains, must be taken into consideration. Here we present a historical view of how increased understanding of cancer genomics has been translated to the clinic and discuss the prospects and challenges for further implementation of a personalized treatment strategy for human solid tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Social and structural factors are now well accepted as determinants of HIV vulnerabilities. These factors are representative of social, economic, organizational and political inequities. Associated with an improved understanding of multiple levels of HIV risk has been the recognition of the need to implement multi-level HIV prevention strategies. Prevention sciences research and programming aiming to decrease HIV incidence requires epidemiologic studies to collect data on multiple levels of risk to inform combination HIV prevention packages.; DISCUSSION: Proximal individual-level risks, such as sharing injection devices and unprotected penile-vaginal or penile-anal sex, are necessary in mediating HIV acquisition and transmission. However, higher order social and structural-level risks can facilitate or reduce HIV transmission on population levels. Data characterizing these risks is often far more actionable than characterizing individual-level risks. We propose a modified social ecological model (MSEM) to help visualize multi-level domains of HIV infection risks and guide the development of epidemiologic HIV studies. Such a model may inform research in epidemiology and prevention sciences, particularly for key populations including men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PID), and sex workers. The MSEM builds on existing frameworks by examining multi-level risk contexts for HIV infection and situating individual HIV infection risks within wider network, community, and public policy contexts as well as epidemic stage. The utility of the MSEM is demonstrated with case studies of HIV risk among PID and MSM.; SUMMARY: The MSEM is a flexible model for guiding epidemiologic studies among key populations at risk for HIV in diverse sociocultural contexts. Successful HIV prevention strategies for key populations require effective integration of evidence-based biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions. While the focus of epidemiologic studies has traditionally been on describing individual-level risk factors, the future necessitates comprehensive epidemiologic data characterizing multiple levels of HIV risk.

AB PURPOSE: We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling using a next-generation sequencing-based assay could identify novel and unanticipated targets of therapy for patients with relapsed invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) was conducted for 3,320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer on indexed, adaptor-ligated, hybridization-captured libraries using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from 22 histologically verified ILC.; RESULTS: A total of 75 genomic alterations were identified with an average of 3.4 alterations per tumor (range, 1-6), of which 35 were actionable for an average of 1.59 actionable alterations per patient (range, 0-3). Nineteen of 22 (86%) of the ILC samples harbored at least one actionable alteration. Six (27%) cases featured alterations in ERRB2 including 4 (18%) with ERBB2 mutation, 1 (5%) with an ERBB2 gene fusion, and 1 (5%) with an ERBB2 copy number gain (amplification). The enrichment of ERBB2 mutations/fusion in CDH1-mutated ILC (5 of 22, 23%) compared with the 5 ERBB2 mutations in a series of 286 non-CDH1-mutated breast cancers from which the ILC cases were obtained (5 of 286, 2%) was significant (P = 0.0006).; CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive genomic profiling of relapsed CDH1-mutated ILC revealed actionable genomic alterations in 86% of cases, featured a high incidence of ERBB2 alterations, and can reveal actionable alterations that can inform treatment decisions for patients with ILC. ©2013 AACR

AB BACKGROUND: Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS), which include a personal health record (PHR), health management tools, and consumer resources, represent the next stage in consumer eHealth systems. It is still unclear, however, what features contribute to an engaging and efficacious PCHMS.; OBJECTIVE: To identify features in a Web-based PCHMS that are associated with consumer utilization of primary care and counselling services, and help-seeking rates for physical and emotional well-being concerns.; METHODS: A one-group pre/posttest online prospective study was conducted on a university campus to measure use of a PCHMS for physical and emotional well-being needs during a university academic semester (July to November 2011). The PCHMS integrated an untethered personal health record (PHR) with well-being journeys, social forums, polls, diaries, and online messaging links with a health service provider, where journeys provide information for consumer participants to engage with clinicians and health services in an actionable way. 1985 students and staff aged 18 and above with access to the Internet were recruited online. Logistic regression, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and chi-square analyses were used to associate participants' help-seeking behaviors and health service utilization with PCHMS usage among the 709 participants eligible for analysis.; RESULTS: A dose-response association was detected between the number of times a user logged into the PCHMS and the number of visits to a health care professional (P=.01), to the university counselling service (P=.03), and help-seeking rates (formal or informal) for emotional well-being matters (P=.03). No significant association was detected between participant pre-study characteristics or well-being ratings at different PCHMS login frequencies. Health service utilization was strongly correlated with use of a bundle of features including: online appointment booking (primary care: OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.01-3.00; counselling: OR 6.04, 95% CI 2.30-15.85), personal health record (health care professional: OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.63-4.89), the poll (health care professional: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.12), and diary (counselling: OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.40-17.35). Help-seeking for physical well-being matters was only correlated with use of the personal health record (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.18-2.53). Help-seeking for emotional well-being concerns (including visits to the university counselling service) was correlated with a bundle comprising the poll (formal or informal help-seeking: OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05), diary (counselling: OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.40-17.35), and online appointment booking (counselling: OR 6.04, 95% CI 2.30-15.85).; CONCLUSIONS: Frequent usage of a PCHMS was significantly associated with increased consumer health service utilization and help-seeking rates for emotional health matters in a university sample. Different bundles of PCHMS features were associated with physical and emotional well-being matters. PCHMS appears to be a promising mechanism to engage consumers in help-seeking or health service utilization for physical and emotional well-being matters.

AB BACKGROUND: Whether for team training, research or evaluation, making effective use of simulation-based technologies requires robust, reliable and accurate assessment tools. Extant literature on simulation-based assessment practices has primarily focused on scenario and instructional design; however, relatively little direct guidance has been provided regarding the challenging decisions and fundamental principles related to assessment development and implementation.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this manuscript is to introduce a generalisable assessment framework supplemented by specific guidance on how to construct and ensure valid and reliable simulation-based team assessment tools. The recommendations reflect best practices in assessment and are designed to empower healthcare educators, professionals and researchers with the knowledge to design and employ valid and reliable simulation-based team assessments.; OVERVIEW: Information and actionable recommendations associated with creating assessments of team processes (non-technical 'teamwork' activities) and performance (demonstration of technical proficiency) are presented which provide direct guidance on how to Distinguish the underlying competencies one aims to assess, Elaborate the measures used to capture team member behaviours during simulation activities, Establish the content validity of these measures and Proceduralise the measurement tools in a way that is systematically aligned with the goals of the simulation activity while maintaining methodological rigour (DEEP).; SUMMARY: The DEEP framework targets fundamental principles and critical activities that are important for effective assessment, and should benefit healthcare educators, professionals and researchers seeking to design or enhance any simulation-based assessment effort.

AB mHealth is an emerging concept in health care and uses mobile communications devices for health services and information. Mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, tablets, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devices can be part of mHealth systems. With mHealth systems, glucose data can now be automatically collected, transmitted, aggregated with other physiologic data, analyzed, stored, and presented as actionable information. mHealth systems use mobile decision support software applications (or apps) to assist or direct health care professionals to make decisions, or they can assist or direct patients to make decisions without waiting for input from a clinician. With real-time decision support for patients, appropriate actions can be taken in real time without waiting to see a clinician. Decisions can be personalized if individual treatment goals and personal preferences for treatment are inputted into an app. Few mHealth apps for diabetes have been rigorously tested. Outcome studies of the use of mHealth for diabetes from the literature have shown the potential for benefits, but higher-quality studies are needed. Regulatory approval of mHealth products will require demonstration of safety and effectiveness, especially where information and trends are not just presented to patients, but used to make treatment recommendations. Three additional hurdles must be overcome to facilitate widespread adoption of this technology, including demonstration of the following: (1) privacy to satisfy regulators, (2) clinical benefit to satisfy clinicians, and (3) economic benefit to satisfy payers. mHealth for diabetes is making rapid strides and is expected to be a transforming technology that will be the next big thing. © 2013 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB The use of biomarkers is becoming increasingly intrinsic to the practice of medicine and holds great promise for transforming the practice of rheumatology. Biomarkers have the potential to aid clinical diagnosis when symptoms are present or to provide a means of detecting early signs of disease when they are not. Some biomarkers can serve as early surrogates of eventual clinical outcomes or guide therapeutic decision making by enabling identification of individuals likely to respond to a specific therapy. Using biomarkers might reduce the costs of drug development by enabling individuals most likely to respond to be enrolled in clinical trials, thereby minimizing the number of participants required. In this Review, we discuss the current use and the potential of biomarkers in rheumatology and in select fields at the forefront of biomarker research. We emphasize the value of different types of biomarkers, addressing the concept of 'actionable' biomarkers, which can be used to guide clinical decision making, and 'mechanistic' biomarkers, a subtype of actionable biomarker that is embedded in disease pathogenesis and, therefore, represents a potentially superior biomarker. We provide examples of actionable and mechanistic biomarkers currently available, and discuss how development of such biomarkers could revolutionize clinical practice and drug development.

AB OBJECTIVE: To overview the newly developed Psychosocial Health Care for Cancer Patients and Their Families: A Framework to Guide Practice in Ontario and Guideline Recommendations in the context of Canadian psychosocial oncology care and propose strategies for guideline uptake and implementation.; METHOD: Recommendations from the 2008 Institute of Medicine standard Cancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs were adapted into the Ontario Psychosocial Oncology (PSO) Framework. Existing practice guidelines developed by the Canadian Partnership against Cancer and Cancer Care Ontario and standards developed by the Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology are supporting resources for adopting a quality improvement (QI) approach to the implementation of the framework in Ontario.; RESULTS: The developed PSO Framework, including 31 specific actionable recommendations, is intended to improve the quality of comprehensive cancer care at both the provider and system levels. Important QI change management processes are described as Educate - raising awareness among medical teams of the significance of psychosocial needs of patients, Evidence - developing a research evidence base for patient care benefits from psychosocial interventions, and Electronics - using technology to collect patient reported outcomes of both physical and emotional symptoms.; CONCLUSIONS: The Ontario PSO Framework is unique and valuable in providing actionable recommendations that can be implemented through QI processes. Overall, the result will be improved psychosocial health care for the cancer population. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB AIMS: Assess whether automatic remote home monitoring (HM) permits same-day evaluation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system dysfunction.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Compromised ICD system integrity (generator/lead) demands prompt evaluation. Home monitoring promises earlier discovery but may be limited by technological differences and follow-up mechanism. We tested whether HM enabled event review within 24 h, and contrasted differing messaging mechanisms. Nine hundred and eight patients in the TRUST prospective multicentre trial were followed by HM for 15 months. ICD system problems automatically triggered notifications: repeatedly ('redundant') for impedance deviations and elective replacement indication (ERI), but only a single transmission for '30 J ineffective'. Detection time from event onset to physician evaluation was measured. Forty-three system-related alerts occurred; 42% were asymptomatic, 42% were actionable, and 22 of 43 (51%) were viewed within 24 h. Redundant notifications were: 1 ERI, 9 shock impedance, 2 ventricular and 6 atrial pacing impedance. Most (11/18; 61%) were detected in <24 h. Others elicited daily notifications without interruption until resolution. For single transmissions, 11 of 25 (44%) events were detected on the same day. Most (56%, 14/25) were detected between 1 and 39 days (mean 10.0 ± 13.0 days). Ten of 14 events were detected by HM and 4 at the time of office visits. These observations suggest single transmissions were vulnerable to detection failure. Mean detection time of redundant events was 1.1 ± 1.8 vs. single transmission 5.6 ± 10.9 days (P = 0.05). Hence, redundant notification avoided late detection.; CONCLUSION: Same-day discovery of ICD dysfunction, even if asymptomatic, was achievable. For those events not evaluated within 24 h, repetitive messaging promoted earlier discovery. Reorganization of clinical follow-up methods may maintain early reaction ability.

AB BACKGROUND: Most personalized cancer care strategies involving DNA sequencing are highly reliant on acquiring sufficient fresh or frozen tissue. It has been challenging to comprehensively evaluate the genome of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) because of limited access to metastatic tissue.; OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a novel next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform that can be used with archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy tissue to evaluate the spectrum of DNA alterations seen in advanced PCa.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: FFPE samples (including archival prostatectomies and prostate needle biopsies) were obtained from 45 patients representing the spectrum of disease: localized PCa, metastatic hormone-naive PCa, and metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). We also assessed paired primaries and metastases to understand disease heterogeneity and disease progression.; INTERVENTION: At least 50 ng of tumor DNA was extracted from FFPE samples and used for hybridization capture and NGS using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.; OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 3320 exons of 182 cancer-associated genes and 37 introns of 14 commonly rearranged genes were evaluated for genomic alterations.; RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We obtained an average sequencing depth of >900X. Overall, 44% of CRPCs harbored genomic alterations involving the androgen receptor gene (AR), including AR copy number gain (24% of CRPCs) or AR point mutation (20% of CRPCs). Other recurrent mutations included transmembrane protease, serine 2 gene (TMPRSS2):v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) gene (ERG) fusion (44%); phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) loss (44%); tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) mutation (40%); retinoblastoma gene (RB) loss (28%); v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) gene (MYC) gain (12%); and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha gene (PIK3CA) mutation (4%). There was a high incidence of genomic alterations involving key genes important for DNA repair, including breast cancer 2, early onset gene (BRCA2) loss (12%) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) mutations (8%); these alterations are potentially targetable with poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase inhibitors. A novel and actionable rearrangement involving the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 gene (BRAF) was also detected.; CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of performing in-depth DNA analyses using FFPE tissue and brings new insight toward understanding the genomic landscape within advanced PCa.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between primary care physicians' (PCPs') beliefs about the causes of obesity with the frequency of nutritional counseling.; METHODS: We analyzed a national cross-sectional internet-based survey of 500 US PCPs collected between February and March 2011.; RESULTS: PCPs that identified overconsumption of food as a very important cause of obesity had significantly greater odds of counseling patients to reduce portion sizes (OR 3.40; 95%CI: 1.73-6.68) and to avoid high calorie ingredients when cooking (OR 2.16; 95%CI: 1.07-4.33). Physicians who believed that restaurant/fast food eating was a very important cause of obesity had significantly greater odds of counseling patients to avoid high calorie menu items outside the home (OR 1.93; 95%CI: 1.20-3.11). Physicians who reported that sugar-sweetened beverages were a very important cause of obesity had significantly greater odds of counseling their obese patients to reduce consumption (OR 5.99; 95%CI: 3.53-10.17).; CONCLUSIONS: PCP beliefs about the diet-related causes of obesity may translate into actionable nutritional counseling topics for physicians to use with their patients.

AB With steadily improved cure rates for children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), treating relapsed ALL has become increasingly challenging largely due to resistance to salvage therapy. Improved biological understanding of mechanisms of relapse and drug resistance, the identification of actionable molecular targets by studying leukaemic cell and host genetics, precise risk stratification with minimum residual disease measurement, and the development of new therapeutic drugs and approaches are needed to improve outcomes of relapsed patients. Molecularly targeted therapies and innovative immunotherapeutic approaches that include specialised monoclonal antibodies and cellular therapies hold promise of enhanced leukaemia cell killing with non-overlapping toxicities. Advances in preparative regimens, donor selection, and supportive care should improve the success of haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation for high-risk patients. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cancer development occurs in response to the successive accumulation of mutations that eventually targets key regulators of cell proliferation. As most mutations likely occur randomly, cancer driver mutations can only be found if they are recurrent. Here we use exome sequencing of the mouse cell lines Panc02, L1210 and Colon 26 to identify genetic alterations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertion and deletions) that occurred in three different strains of mice and that resulted in tumorigenesis. We identify known mutations in genes like Kras, Cdkn2a/b, Smad4 and Trp53 and a large list of genes whose causal link to cancer is unknown. Interestingly, by screening a compound library we find that the identified oncogenic Kras mutation in Colon 26 cells correlates with its sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis of these mouse tumor exomes show that their manageable number of mutations could facilitate the identification of novel mutations or pathways driving tumor development. Furthermore, their use as tools is now enhanced as they can be used to create syngenic transplant models for utilization in drug discovery and validation. Finally, by showing that Kras mutant Colon 26 cells are sensitive to MEK inhibitors, we provide one proof-of-principle experiment that a platform containing targeted resequencing and drug screens could be a valuable addition in the clinic to devise anti-cancer drug schemes.

AB BACKGROUND: Implementation and use of electronic health records (EHRs) could lead to potential improvements in quality of care. However, the use of EHRs also introduces unique and often unexpected patient safety risks. Proactive assessment of risks and vulnerabilities can help address potential EHR-related safety hazards before harm occurs; however, current risk assessment methods are underdeveloped. The overall objective of this project is to develop and validate proactive assessment tools to ensure that EHR-enabled clinical work systems are safe and effective.; METHODS/DESIGN: This work is conceptually grounded in an 8-dimension model of safe and effective health information technology use. Our first aim is to develop self-assessment guides that can be used by health care institutions to evaluate certain high-risk components of their EHR-enabled clinical work systems. We will solicit input from subject matter experts and relevant stakeholders to develop guides focused on 9 specific risk areas and will subsequently pilot test the guides with individuals representative of likely users. The second aim will be to examine the utility of the self-assessment guides by beta testing the guides at selected facilities and conducting on-site evaluations. Our multidisciplinary team will use a variety of methods to assess the content validity and perceived usefulness of the guides, including interviews, naturalistic observations, and document analysis. The anticipated output of this work will be a series of self-administered EHR safety assessment guides with clear, actionable, checklist-type items.; DISCUSSION: Proactive assessment of patient safety risks increases the resiliency of health care organizations to unanticipated hazards of EHR use. The resulting products and lessons learned from the development of the assessment guides are expected to be helpful to organizations that are beginning the EHR selection and implementation process as well as those that have already implemented EHRs. Findings from our project, currently underway, will inform future efforts to validate and implement tools that can be used by health care organizations to improve the safety of EHR-enabled clinical work systems.

AB Western European health systems are not keeping pace with changes in child health needs. Non-communicable diseases are increasingly common causes of childhood illness and death. Countries are responding to changing needs by adapting child health services in different ways and useful insights can be gained through comparison, especially because some have better outcomes, or have made more progress, than others. Although overall child health has improved throughout Europe, wide inequities remain. Health services and social and cultural determinants contribute to differences in health outcomes. Improvement of child health and reduction of suffering are achievable goals. Development of systems more responsive to evolving child health needs is likely to necessitate reconfiguring of health services as part of a whole-systems approach to improvement of health. Chronic care services and first-contact care systems are important aspects. The Swedish and Dutch experiences of development of integrated systems emphasise the importance of supportive policies backed by adequate funding. France, the UK, Italy, and Germany offer further insights into chronic care services in different health systems. First-contact care models and the outcomes they deliver are highly variable. Comparisons between systems are challenging. Important issues emerging include the organisation of first-contact models, professional training, arrangements for provision of out-of-hours services, and task-sharing between doctors and nurses. Flexible first-contact models in which child health professionals work closely together could offer a way to balance the need to provide expertise with ready access. Strategies to improve child health and health services in Europe necessitate a whole-systems approach in three interdependent systems-practice (chronic care models, first-contact care, competency standards for child health professionals), plans (child health indicator sets, reliable systems for capture and analysis of data, scale-up of child health research, anticipation of future child health needs), and policy (translation of high-level goals into actionable policies, open and transparent accountability structures, political commitment to delivery of improvements in child health and equity throughout Europe).

AB BACKGROUND: The importance of tackling economic, social and health-related inequities is increasingly accepted as a core concern for the post-Millennium Development Goal framework. However, there is a global dearth of high-quality, policy-relevant and actionable data on inequities within populations, which means that development solutions seldom focus on the people who need them most. INTREC (INDEPTH Training and Research Centres of Excellence) was established with this concern in mind. It aims to provide training for researchers from the INDEPTH network on associations between health inequities, the social determinants of health (SDH), and health outcomes, and on presenting their findings in a usable form to policy makers.; OBJECTIVE: As part of a baseline situation analysis for INTREC, this paper assesses the current status of SDH training in three of the African INTREC countries - Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa - as well as the gaps, barriers, and opportunities for training.; METHODS: SDH-related courses from the three countries were identified through personal knowledge of the researchers, supplemented by snowballing and online searches. Interviews were also conducted with, among others, academics engaged in SDH and public health training in order to provide context and complementary material. Information regarding access to the Internet, as a possible INTREC teaching medium, was gathered in each country through online searches.; RESULTS: SDH-relevant training is available, but 1) the number of places available for students is limited; 2) the training tends to be public-health-oriented rather than inclusive of the broader, multi-sectoral issues associated with SDH; and 3) insufficient funding places limitations on both students and on the training institutions themselves, thereby affecting participation and quality. We also identified rapidly expanding Internet connectivity in all three countries, which opens up opportunities for e-learning on SDH, though the current quality of the Internet services remains mixed.; CONCLUSIONS: SDH training is currently in short supply, and there is a clear role for INTREC to contribute to the training of a critical mass of African researchers on the topic. This work will be accomplished most effectively by building on pre-existing networks, institutions, and methods.

AB PURPOSE: We examined whether quality of mammography interpretation as performed by the original reading radiologist varied by patient sociodemographic characteristics.; METHODS: For 149 patients residing in Chicago and diagnosed in 2005-2008, we obtained the original index mammogram that detected the breast cancer and at least one prior mammogram that did not detect the cancer performed within 2 years of the index mammogram. A single breast imaging specialist performed a blinded review of the prior mammogram. Potentially missed detection (PMD) was defined as an actionable lesion seen during a blinded review of the prior mammogram that was in the same quadrant as the cancer on the index mammogram.; RESULTS: Of 149 prior mammograms originally read as nonmalignant, 46% (N = 68) had a potentially detectable lesion. In unadjusted analyses, PMD was greater among minority patients (54% vs. 39%, P = .07) and for patients with incomes below $30,000 (65% vs. 36%, P < .01), less education (58% vs. 39%, P = .02), and lacking private health insurance (63% vs. 40%, P = .02). Likelihood ratio tests for the inclusion of socioeconomic variables in multivariable logistic regression models were highly significant (P ≤ .02).; CONCLUSIONS: Disadvantaged socioeconomic status appears to be associated with PMD of breast cancer at mammography screening.

AB Comparative effectiveness research (CER) has been receiving much attention (and government funding) in recent years, stemming from dissatisfaction with much medical and health care research, which does not produce actionable evidence that can be used by clinicians, patients, and policymakers. Rehabilitation research has been characterized by similar weaknesses and by often inadequate research designs. The SCIRehab study of the outcomes of inpatient spinal cord injury rehabilitation is one of a small number of rehabilitation practice-based evidence (PBE) studies in recent years that allows for the comparison of interventions by all disciplines for relevant real-life outcomes. This introduction to a series of articles resulting from the SCIRehab project discusses the need for and the nature of CER, and places the SCIRehab study and other PBE studies in the light of CER. After a description of the highlights of the analyses in this supplement, we provide a preliminary evaluation of SCIRehab, counting the articles and presentations from the study, the resources that went into this vast project, and the lessons learned that may benefit future rehabilitation PBE investigators.

AB PURPOSE: Tumor gene mutation status is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of patients with cancer. A comprehensive catalog of tumor gene-response outcomes from individual patients is needed, especially for actionable mutations and rare variants. We created a proof-of-principle database [DNA-mutation Inventory to Refine and Enhance Cancer Treatment (DIRECT)], starting with lung cancer-associated EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations, to provide a resource for clinicians to prioritize treatment decisions based on a patient's tumor mutations at the point of care.; METHODS: A systematic search of literature published between June 2005 and May 2011 was conducted through PubMed to identify patient-level, mutation-drug response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutant tumors. Minimum inclusion criteria included patient's EGFR mutation, corresponding treatment, and an associated radiographic outcome.; RESULTS: A total of 1,021 patients with 1,070 separate EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy responses from 116 different publications were included. About 188 unique EGFR mutations occurring in 207 different combinations were identified: 149 different mutation combinations were associated with disease control and 42 were associated with disease progression. Four secondary mutations, in 16 different combinations, were associated with acquired resistance.; CONCLUSIONS: As tumor sequencing becomes more common in oncology, this comprehensive electronic catalog can enable genome-directed anticancer therapy. DIRECT will eventually encompass all tumor mutations associated with clinical outcomes on targeted therapies. Users can make specific queries at http://www.mycancergenome.org/about/direct to obtain clinically relevant data associated with various mutations. ©2013 AACR.

AB Although the potential for genomics to contribute to clinical care has long been anticipated, the pace of defining the risks and benefits of incorporating genomic findings into medical practice has been relatively slow. Several institutions have recently begun genomic medicine programs, encountering many of the same obstacles and developing the same solutions, often independently. Recognizing that successful early experiences can inform subsequent efforts, the National Human Genome Research Institute brought together a number of these groups to describe their ongoing projects and challenges, identify common infrastructure and research needs, and outline an implementation framework for investigating and introducing similar programs elsewhere. Chief among the challenges were limited evidence and consensus on which genomic variants were medically relevant; lack of reimbursement for genomically driven interventions; and burden to patients and clinicians of assaying, reporting, intervening, and following up genomic findings. Key infrastructure needs included an openly accessible knowledge base capturing sequence variants and their phenotypic associations and a framework for defining and cataloging clinically actionable variants. Multiple institutions are actively engaged in using genomic information in clinical care. Much of this work is being done in isolation and would benefit from more structured collaboration and sharing of best practices.Genet Med 2013:15(4):258-267.

AB The successes of targeted drugs with companion predictive biomarkers and the technological advances in gene sequencing have generated enthusiasm for evaluating personalized cancer medicine strategies using genomic profiling. We assessed the feasibility of incorporating real-time analysis of somatic mutations within exons of 19 genes into patient management. Blood, tumor biopsy and archived tumor samples were collected from 50 patients recruited from four cancer centers. Samples were analyzed using three technologies: targeted exon sequencing using Pacific Biosciences PacBio RS, multiplex somatic mutation genotyping using Sequenom MassARRAY and Sanger sequencing. An expert panel reviewed results prior to reporting to clinicians. A clinical laboratory verified actionable mutations. Fifty patients were recruited. Nineteen actionable mutations were identified in 16 (32%) patients. Across technologies, results were in agreement in 100% of biopsy specimens and 95% of archival specimens. Profiling results from paired archival/biopsy specimens were concordant in 30/34 (88%) patients. We demonstrated that the use of next generation sequencing for real-time genomic profiling in advanced cancer patients is feasible. Additionally, actionable mutations identified in this study were relatively stable between archival and biopsy samples, implying that cancer mutations that are good predictors of drug response may remain constant across clinical stages.

AB BACKGROUND: Biomedical natural language processing (NLP) applications that have access to detailed resources about the linguistic characteristics of biomedical language demonstrate improved performance on tasks such as relation extraction and syntactic or semantic parsing. Such applications are important for transforming the growing unstructured information buried in the biomedical literature into structured, actionable information. In this paper, we address the creation of linguistic resources that capture how individual biomedical verbs behave. We specifically consider verb subcategorization, or the tendency of verbs to "select" co-occurrence with particular phrase types, which influences the interpretation of verbs and identification of verbal arguments in context. There are currently a limited number of biomedical resources containing information about subcategorization frames (SCFs), and these are the result of either labor-intensive manual collation, or automatic methods that use tools adapted to a single biomedical subdomain. Either method may result in resources that lack coverage. Moreover, the quality of existing verb SCF resources for biomedicine is unknown, due to a lack of available gold standards for evaluation.; RESULTS: This paper presents three new resources related to verb subcategorization frames in biomedicine, and four experiments making use of the new resources. We present the first biomedical SCF gold standards, capturing two different but widely-used definitions of subcategorization, and a new SCF lexicon, BioCat, covering a large number of biomedical sub-domains. We evaluate the SCF acquisition methodologies for BioCat with respect to the gold standards, and compare the results with the accuracy of the only previously existing automatically-acquired SCF lexicon for biomedicine, the BioLexicon. Our results show that the BioLexicon has greater precision while BioCat has better coverage of SCFs. Finally, we explore the definition of subcategorization using these resources and its implications for biomedical NLP. All resources are made publicly available.; CONCLUSION: The SCF resources we have evaluated still show considerably lower accuracy than that reported with general English lexicons, demonstrating the need for domain- and subdomain-specific SCF acquisition tools for biomedicine. Our new gold standards reveal major differences when annotators use the different definitions. Moreover, evaluation of BioCat yields major differences in accuracy depending on the gold standard, demonstrating that the definition of subcategorization adopted will have a direct impact on perceived system accuracy for specific tasks.

AB BACKGROUND: Performance feedback is one of a number of strategies used to improve clinical practice among students and clinicians.; OBJECTIVES: The aims of this paper were to examine conceptual underpinnings and essential components for audit and feedback strategies, to assess the extent to which recently published audit and feedback interventions include these components and to recommend future directions for feedback to improve its educational and behavioural impact.; METHODS: Based on the actionable feedback model, we examined the presence of four theoretical constructs--timeliness, individualization, lack of punitiveness and customizability--in studies published during 2009-2010 which included a feedback intervention.; RESULTS: There was wide variation in the definition, implementation and outcomes of 'feedback' interventions, making it difficult to compare across studies. None of the studies we reviewed included all of the components of the actionable feedback model.; CONCLUSIONS: Feedback interventions reported to date, even when results are positive, often fail to include concepts of behaviour change. This may partially explain the large variation in approaches and in results of such interventions and presents major challenges for replicating any given intervention. If feedback processes are to be successfully used and disseminated and implemented widely, some standardization and certainly more clarity is needed in the specific action steps taken to apply behavioural theory to practice. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Pap results do not typically lead to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV triage is not cost-effective because most cases are HPV-positive. However, under new national guidelines recommending cotesting for women aged 30 to 64 years, clinicians will increasingly receive the HPV test result with LSIL Pap results. Some authors have suggested that HPV triage might be effective at older ages, when the percentage of HPV positivity among women with LSIL declines.; METHODS: We estimated 5-year risks of CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ among 9,033 women aged 30 to 64 years who had both an HPV test and an LSIL Pap result.; RESULTS: HPV positivity among women with LSIL decreased only slightly with age (30 to 34 vs 60 to 64 years, 88% vs 72%, p < .0001). The 5-year risks of CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ of women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-positive/LSIL were larger than those among women testing HPV-negative/LSIL (CIN 2+, 19% vs 5.1%, p < .0001; CIN 3+, 6.1% vs 2.0%, p<.0001). The 5-year risk of CIN 3+ in HPV-negative/LSIL women was similar to that for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) Pap test result without knowledge of HPV test results (2.0% vs 2.6%, p = .4).; CONCLUSIONS: HPV-negative/LSIL posed lower risk than other Pap results that guidelines currently recommend for referral to immediate colposcopy. By the principle of "equal management of equal risks," women with HPV-negative/LSIL might reasonably be managed similarly to those with ASC-US Pap results without knowledge of HPV testing, that is, retesting at 6 to 12 months, rather than immediate colposcopy. Although the HPV test result for LSIL Pap results provides actionable information to clinicians who screen with cotesting, the high HPV positivity of LSIL at even the oldest ages suggests the lack of cost-effectiveness of HPV triage of LSIL for clinicians who do not use routine cotesting.

AB Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LM) is an infrequent yet morbid and often fatal complication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Management of LM is multimodal, often involving systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and a variety of symptom management maneuvers to address elevated intracranial pressure, pain, and mood changes that can accompany the disease. It is increasingly recognized that tumors with actionable mutations in NSCLC, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, respond well to systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors yet often progress in the central nervous system. More information is needed regarding the natural history and optimal management of LM in specific molecular subtypes of NSCLC. This case report summarizes the management of a patient with ALK-positive NSCLC who developed LM while on targeted treatment with crizotinib within the context of current NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology and recently published studies.

AB Rising health care costs and continued concerns about safety, efficacy, and quality have resulted in the demand for more data and evidence by payors, regulators, providers, and patients alike. Stakeholders with different objectives for the use of data are driving the need for more and better data. It is important for organizations to not only understand how to handle and collect data but also translate it into actionable information that can help transform health care delivery. Appropriate use of data can lead to reduced health care costs and increased value to all stakeholders. In June 2012, NCCN assembled a work group composed of thought leaders from NCCN Member Institutions and other organizations to identify and examine the challenges of data generation, collection, and application for clinical, regulatory, and coverage decision-making. The NCCN Data Needs Work Group identified 4 main areas for consideration: data sources, patient-derived data, payor-collected data, and regulatory policy toward data generation and use.

AB With the health care environment shifting to a value-based payment system, Catholic Health Initiatives nursing leadership spearheaded an initiative with 14 hospitals to establish best nursing care at a lower cost. The implementation of technology-enabled business processes at point of care led to a new model for best value nursing care: Value-Based Resource Management. The new model integrates clinical patient data from the electronic medical record and embeds the new information in care team workflows for actionable real-time decision support and predictive forecasting. The participating hospitals reported increased patient satisfaction and cost savings in the reduction of overtime and improvement in length of stay management. New data generated by the initiative on nursing hours and cost by patient and by population (Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups), and patient health status outcomes across the acute care continuum expanded business intelligence for a value-based population health system.

AB Biomedical science in the 21(st) century is embedded in, and draws from, a digital commons and "Big Data" created by high-throughput Omics technologies such as genomics. Classic Edisonian metaphors of science and scientists (i.e., "the lone genius" or other narrow definitions of expertise) are ill equipped to harness the vast promises of the 21(st) century digital commons. Moreover, in medicine and life sciences, experts often under-appreciate the important contributions made by citizen scholars and lead users of innovations to design innovative products and co-create new knowledge. We believe there are a large number of users waiting to be mobilized so as to engage with Big Data as citizen scientists-only if some funding were available. Yet many of these scholars may not meet the meta-criteria used to judge expertise, such as a track record in obtaining large research grants or a traditional academic curriculum vitae. This innovation research article describes a novel idea and action framework: micro-grants, each worth $1000, for genomics and Big Data. Though a relatively small amount at first glance, this far exceeds the annual income of the "bottom one billion"-the 1.4 billion people living below the extreme poverty level defined by the World Bank ($1.25/day). We describe two types of micro-grants. Type 1 micro-grants can be awarded through established funding agencies and philanthropies that create micro-granting programs to fund a broad and highly diverse array of small artisan labs and citizen scholars to connect genomics and Big Data with new models of discovery such as open user innovation. Type 2 micro-grants can be funded by existing or new science observatories and citizen think tanks through crowd-funding mechanisms described herein. Type 2 micro-grants would also facilitate global health diplomacy by co-creating crowd-funded micro-granting programs across nation-states in regions facing political and financial instability, while sharing similar disease burdens, therapeutics, and diagnostic needs. We report the creation of ten Type 2 micro-grants for citizen science and artisan labs to be administered by the nonprofit Data-Enabled Life Sciences Alliance International (DELSA Global, Seattle). Our hope is that these micro-grants will spur novel forms of disruptive innovation and genomics translation by artisan scientists and citizen scholars alike. We conclude with a neglected voice from the global health frontlines, the American University of Iraq in Sulaimani, and suggest that many similar global regions are now poised for micro-grant enabled collective innovation to harness the 21(st) century digital commons.

AB The triacylglycerol (TAG) pathway provides several targets for genetic engineering to optimize microalgal lipid productivity. GPAT (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) is a crucial enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of TAG biosynthesis. Despite many recent biochemical studies, a comprehensive sequence-structure analysis of GPAT across diverse lipid-yielding organisms is lacking. Hence, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of plastid-located GPAT proteins from 7 microalgae and 3 higher plants species. The close evolutionary relationship observed between red algae/diatoms and green algae/plant lineages in the phylogenetic tree were further corroborated by motif and gene structure analysis. The predicted molecular weight, amino acid composition, Instability Index, and hydropathicity profile gave an overall representation of the biochemical features of GPAT protein across the species under study. Furthermore, homology models of GPAT from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Glycine max provided deep insights into the protein architecture and substrate binding sites. Despite low sequence identity found between algal and plant GPATs, the developed models exhibited strikingly conserved topology consisting of 14alpha helices and 9beta sheets arranged in two domains. However, subtle variations in amino acids of fatty acyl binding site were identified that might influence the substrate selectivity of GPAT. Together, the results will provide useful resources to understand the functional and evolutionary relationship of GPAT and potentially benefit in development of engineered enzyme for augmenting algal biofuel production.

AB This article offers a scholarly review and perspective on the potential of "implementation research" to generate incremental, context-sensitive, evidence-based management strategies for the successful implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) (such as the "central line bundle"). Many hospitals have difficulty consistently implementing EBPs at the unit level. This problem has been broadly characterized as "change implementation failure" in health care organizations. The popular hospital response to this challenge has been to raise clinician awareness of EBPs through mandated educational programs. However, this approach has not always succeeded in changing practice. The health services research literature has emphasized the role of several organizational variables (eg, leadership, safety culture, organizational learning, teamwork and communication, and physician/staff engagement) in successful change implementation. Correspondingly, this literature has developed broad frameworks and programs for change in health care organizations. While these broad change frameworks have been successfully applied by some facilities to change practice, they are not incrementally actionable. As such, several facilities have not leveraged broad change frameworks because of resource and/or contextual limitations; a majority of hospitals continue to resort to mandated clinician education (awareness-building) for change implementation. The recent impetus toward "implementation research" in health care has the potential to generate incremental, context-sensitive, evidence-based management strategies for practice change. Authors discuss specific insights from a recently completed study on central line bundle implementation in 2 intensive care units in an academic health center. The study demonstrates that awareness of EBPs alone does not translate to implementation. More importantly, the study also identifies incremental, context-sensitive, evidence-based management strategies for successful implementation of EBPs at the unit level.

AB Two types of harassment are distinguished: sexual and psychological. In the private sector, according to French labour laws and the penal code, psychological harassment is actionable. It is up to the employer to prove the absence of harassment. The sanctions incurred can be up to 5 years imprisonment and a 150,000 euro fine and various measures of compensation for damages can be envisaged.

AB Hospital readmission rates are increasingly used as a performance indicator. Whether they are a valid, reliable, and actionable measure for behavioral health is unknown. Using the MarketScan Multistate Medicaid Claims Database, this study examined hospital- and patient-level predictors of behavioral health readmission rates. Among hospitals with at least 25 annual admissions, the median behavioral health readmission rate was 11% (10th percentile, 3%; 90th percentile, 18%). Increased follow-up at community mental health centers was associated with lower probabilities of readmission, although follow-up with other types of providers was not significantly associated with hospital readmissions. Hospital average length of stay was positively associated with lower readmission rates; however, the effect size was small. Patients with a prior inpatient stay, a substance use disorder, psychotic illness, and medical comorbidities were more likely to be readmitted. Additional research is needed to further understand how the provision of inpatient services and post-discharge follow-up influence readmissions.

AB Recent sequencing efforts have described the mutational landscape of the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Although MLL2 is among the most frequent somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV), the clinical and biological significance of these mutations remains uncharacterized. Through targeted re-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14/175) of MBs, the majority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations affecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 mutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or molecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 MBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A activity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and 4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2, KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.

AB Skilled birth attendance (SBA) and healthcare facility (HCF) delivery are effective means of reducing maternal mortality. However, their uptake remains low in many low-income countries. The present study utilized semi-structured interviews with 85 pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic in Akwatia, Ghana (May-July 2010) to better understand the barriers to SBA and HCF delivery through the underrepresented perspective of pregnant women. Interview transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Participants described community support for and uptake of HCF delivery as increasing and becoming normalized, but barriers remain: (1) maltreatment by midwives; (2) cost associated with HCF delivery despite waived facility fees; (3) the need for a support person for HCF delivery; (4) difficulties in transportation; and (5) precipitous labor. Given the importance of community in Ghanaian health care decision-making, increasing community support for HCF delivery suggests progress toward increasing uptake of SBA and HCF delivery, however important actionable barriers remain.

AB Whole exome or whole genome analysis using massively parallel sequencing technologies will undoubtedly solve diagnostic dilemmas; however, incidental findings (IF) that may have medical and social implications will also be discovered. While there is consensus in the literature that analytically valid and medically actionable IF should be returned to patients if requested, there is debate regarding the return of other IF. There are currently no guidelines established for managing IF in the clinical context. We therefore distributed an online questionnaire to 496 geneticists and genetic counselors in Canada to explore this unresolved issue, and 210 professionals participated (response rate = 42%). The proportion of respondents who indicated that they would return IF to patients depended on the nature of the finding, ranging from 95% for information pertaining to a serious and treatable condition to 12% for information with only social implications (e.g., non-paternity). There was a lack of consensus around the disclosure of certain IF such as genetic carrier status, especially for pediatric patients. The most important considerations identified as impacting IF disclosure included condition-specific factors such as treatment availability, test accuracy, and evidence indicating pathogenicity. This is the first study to document the views of geneticists and genetic counselors in Canada towards the disclosure of IF, and represents a step towards evidence-based guidelines for clinical genome-wide sequencing investigations.

AB Scientific discovery linking the environment to beneficial and adverse health children's health outcomes is rapidly expanding, leading scientists and health professionals to call for timely action to prevent harm and secure benefits. A robust method to synthesize what is known about the environmental drivers of health is a foundational step to making the science actionable by individuals and decision-makers. To meet this need, a methodology called the Navigation Guide was crafted by a collaboration of 22 clinical and environmental health scientists. The Navigation Guide proceeds from methods of research synthesis used in clinical settings but accounts for differences between environmental and clinical health sciences related to the evidence-base and decision-context. The methodology can be used to develop evidence profiles that provide simple, transparent summaries, such as practice guidelines or other evidence-based recommendations for prevention. Establishing proof-of-concept of the method is underway. Development of the Navigation Guide is extremely timely as it coincides with growing recognition of the need for updated methods in risk assessment. The costs in 2008 to the US healthcare system for treatment of childhood illnesses linked to toxic environmental exposures is conservatively estimated to be over $76 billion, and it is anticipated that US healthcare policy decisions will increasingly rely on systematic reviews of the evidence. The Navigation Guide is poised to provide a methodological bridge to link healthcare decision-making to efforts to reduce toxic environmental exposures. The institutionalization of the Navigation Guide would provide a concrete mechanism for linking science to action to protect children's health. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Cancer pain is one of most prevalent symptoms in patients with cancer. Acupuncture and related techniques have been suggested for the management of cancer pain. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for adult cancer pain recommends acupuncture, as one of several integrative interventions, in conjunction with pharmacologic intervention as needed. This review presents the latest available evidence regarding the use of acupuncture for cancer pain. It also provides "actionable" acupuncture protocols for specific cancer pain conditions and related symptoms in order to provide more clinically relevant solutions for clinicians and cancer patients with pain. These conditions include postoperative cancer pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postsurgical gastroparesis syndrome, opioid-induced constipation, opioid-induced pruritus, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, aromatase inhibitor-associated joint pain, and neck dissection-related pain and dysfunction.

AB Genome sequencing has been rapidly integrated into clinical research and is currently marketed to health-care practitioners and consumers alike. The volume of sequencing data generated for a single individual and the wide range of findings from whole-genome sequencing raise critical questions about the return of results and their potential value for end-users. We conducted a mixed-methods study of 311 sequential participants in the NIH ClinSeq study to assess general preferences and specific attitudes toward learning results. We tested how these variables predicted intentions to receive results within four categories of findings ranging from medically actionable to variants of unknown significance. Two hundred and ninety-four participants indicated a preference to learn their genome sequencing results. Most often, participants cited disease prevention as their reason, including intention to change their lifestyle behaviors. Participants held positive attitudes, strongly perceived social norms and strong intentions to learn results, although there were significant mean differences among four categories of findings (P<0.01). Attitudes and social norms for medically actionable and carrier results were most similar and rated the highest. Participants distinguished among the types and quality of information they may receive, despite strong intentions to learn all results presented. These intentions were motivated by confidence in their ability to use the information to prevent future disease and a belief in the value of even uninterpretable information. It behooves investigators to facilitate participants' desire to learn a range of information from genomic sequencing while promoting realistic expectations for its clinical and personal utility.

AB OBJECTIVES: In 2007, Australia implemented an ongoing, school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme for school-aged girls, and a catch-up programme for 18-26-year-old women that ran until the end of 2009. The availability of what is widely known as the 'cervical cancer vaccine' means there is the potential for women to believe, incorrectly, that they no longer require regular cervical screening, and this risk needs to be addressed. The current study aimed to assess the effect of three mass media campaigns to promote cervical screening on the rate of cervical screening tests in the Australian state of Victoria, after HPV vaccine became available.; METHODS: Seasonal time series assessed the effect of media campaigns broadcast in 2007, 2009 and 2010 on the rate of weekly cervical screening tests in Victorian women from 2006 to 2010, stratified by time since last screening test.; RESULTS: The 2007 and 2009 media campaigns significantly increased the number of cervical screening tests per week. The 2007 campaign had a significant impact on lapsed screeners (>36 months since last test), overdue screeners (28-36 months since last test), and women never previously screened. The 2009 campaign significantly increased screening tests for overdue screeners, and the 2010 media campaign was associated with a significant increase in screening tests for lapsed screeners.; CONCLUSIONS: A well-researched and carefully pretested television advertising campaign with accurate, actionable messages can elicit appropriate screening behaviour among some of the appropriate groups even in a changed environment of complex, and potentially competing, messages.

AB BACKGROUND: Pain screening may improve the quality of care by identifying patients in need of further assessment and management. Many health care systems use the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain screening, and record the score in the patients' electronic medical record (EMR).; OBJECTIVE: Determine the level of agreement between EMR and patient survey NRS, and whether discrepancies vary by demographic and clinical characteristics.; METHODS: We linked survey data from a sample of veterans receiving care in 8 Veterans Affairs medical facilities, to EMR data including an NRS collected on the day of the survey to compare responses to the NRS question from these 2 sources. We assessed correlation, agreement on clinical cut-points (eg, severe), and, using the survey as the gold standard, whether patient characteristics were associated with a discrepancy on moderate-severe pain.; RESULTS: A total of 1643 participants had a survey and EMR NRS score on the same day. The correlation was 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.59), but the mean EMR score was significantly lower than the survey score (1.72 vs. 2.79; P<0.0001). Agreement was moderate (kappa=0.35). Characteristics associated with an increased odds of a discrepancy included: diabetes [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.48], posttraumatic stress disorder (AOR=1.59), major depressive disorder (AOR=1.81), other race versus white (AOR=2.29), and facility in which care was received.; CONCLUSIONS: The underestimation of pain using EMR data, especially clinically actionable levels of pain, has important clinical and research implications. Improving the quality of pain care may require better screening.

AB OBJECTIVES: The goals of this paper are to review the literature on feedback-seeking behaviour using a self-motives framework and to provide practical recommendations for medical educators on how to encourage feedback-seeking behaviour.; METHODS: To gain a better understanding of feedback-seeking behaviour, we apply a self-motives framework. Through this conceptual lens, we define feedback-seeking behaviour and review its antecedents and consequences. We provide an overview of the key findings and answer to a number of unresolved issues in the literature.; RESULTS: On the basis of the literature review, we present six evidence-based insights to encourage feedback-seeking behaviour in practice.; CONCLUSIONS: The literature review shows that feedback-seeking behaviour is a valuable resource for individuals in work and educational settings as it aids their adaptation, learning and performance. Several individual and contextual factors that promote the seeking of feedback are presented. Although feedback-seeking behaviour has been a subject of research for over 25 years, some unresolved issues remain. We present a self-motives framework to resolve those issues and to stimulate future research. We conclude this paper with six actionable insights for medical educators based on the evidence reviewed. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2013.

AB There is growing demand for routine identification of actionable mutations in clinical cancer specimens. Genotyping platforms must provide rapid turnaround times and work effectively with limited amounts of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens that often yield poor quality DNA. We describe semiconductor-based sequencing of DNA from FFPE specimens using a single-tube, multiplexed panel of 190 amplicons targeting 46 cancer genes. With just 10 ng of input DNA, average read depths of 2000* can be obtained in 48 hours, with >95% of the reads on target. A validation set of 45 FFPE tumor specimens containing 53 point mutations previously identified with a mass spectrometry-based genotyping platform, along with 19 indels ranging from 4 to 63 bp, was used to evaluate assay performance. With a mutant allele ratio cutoff of 8%, we were able to achieve 100% sensitivity (95% CI = 97.3% to 100.0%) and 95.1% specificity (95% CI = 91.8% to 98.0%) of point mutation detection. All indels were visible by manual inspection of aligned reads; 6/9 indels ≤12 bp long were detected by the variant caller software either exactly or as mismatched nucleotides within the indel region. The rapid turnaround time and low input DNA requirements make the multiplex PCR and semiconductor-based sequencing approach a viable option for mutation detection in a clinical laboratory.

AB Public Utility Commissions (PUC) in several states adopted 0.5 volt rms (root mean squared) or 1.0 milliampere as the actionable limit for utilities to respond to complaints of uncontrolled voltage. This study clearly shows that the actionable level should be reduced to 10 mV p-p (peak-to-peak), which is 140 times less than the current standard. Dairy farmer complaints that animal behavior and milk production were affected by electrical shocks below adopted standards were investigated on 12 farms in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. Milk production per cow was determined from daily tank-weight pickup and number of cows milked. Number of transient events, transients, voltage p-p, waveform phase angle degree, sags, and sag-Vrms were measured from event recorders plugged into milk house wall outlets. Data from 1705 cows and 939 data points were analyzed by multiherd least-squares multiple regression and SAS-ANOVA statistical programs. In five herds for 517 days, milk/cow/day decreased -0.0281 kg/transient event as transient events increased from 0 to 122/day (P<0.02). Negative effects on milk/cow/day from event recorder measurements were significant for eight independent electrical variables. Step-potential voltage and frequency of earth currents were measured by oscilloscope from metal plates grouted into the floor of milking stalls. Milk decreased as number of 3rd, 5th, 7th, 21st, 28th, and 42nd harmonics and the sum of triplen harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, 27th, 33rd, and 39th) increased/day (P<0.003). Event recorder transient events were positively correlated with oscilloscope average V p-p event readings. Steps/min counted from videotapes of a dancing cow with no contact to metal in the barnyard were correlated with non-sinusoidal 8.1 to 14.6 mV p-p impulses recorded by oscilloscope for 5 min from EKG patches on legs. PUC standards and use of 500-Ohm resistors in test circuits underestimate effects of non-sinusoidal, higher frequency voltage/current common on rural power lines. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Follicular lymphoma (FL) is currently incurable using conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimes, compelling new strategies. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies that can reveal oncogenic pathways have stimulated interest in tailoring therapies toward actionable somatic mutations. However, for mutation-directed therapies to be most effective, the mutations must be uniformly present in evolved tumor cells as well as in the self-renewing tumor-cell precursors. Here, we show striking intratumoral clonal diversity within FL tumors in the representation of mutations in the majority of genes as revealed by whole exome sequencing of subpopulations. This diversity captures a clonal hierarchy, resolved using immunoglobulin somatic mutations and IGH-BCL2 translocations as a frame of reference and by comparing diagnosis and relapse tumor pairs, allowing us to distinguish early versus late genetic eventsduring lymphomagenesis. We provide evidence that IGH-BCL2 translocations and CREBBP mutations are early events, whereas MLL2 and TNFRSF14 mutations probably represent late events during disease evolution. These observations provide insight into which of the genetic lesions represent suitable candidates for targeted therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: National community-based health worker (CBHW) programs often face challenges in ensuring that these remote workers are adequately trained, equipped and supervised. As governments increasingly deploy CBHWs to improve access to primary health care, there is an urgent need to assess how well health systems are supporting CBHWs to provide high quality care.; METHODS: This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods assessment of selected health systems supports (supervision, drug supply, and job aids) for a national community case management (CCM) program for childhood illness in Malawi during the first year of implementation. We collected data on the types and levels of drug supply and supervision through a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) providing CCM services in six districts. We then conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with program managers and HSAs, respectively, to gain an understanding of the barriers and facilitating factors for delivering health systems supports for CCM.; RESULTS: Although the CCM training and job aid were well received by stakeholders, HSAs who participated in the first CCM training sessions often waited up to 4 months before receiving their initial supply of drugs and first supervision visits. One year after training began, 69% of HSAs had all essential CCM drugs in stock and only 38% of HSAs reported a CCM supervision visit in the 3 months prior to the survey. Results of the qualitative assessment indicated that drug supply was constrained by travel distance and stock outs at health facilities, and that the initial supervision system relied on clinicians who were able to spend only limited time away from clinical duties. Proactive district managers trained and enrolled HSAs' routine supervisors to provide CCM supervision.; CONCLUSIONS: Malawi's CCM program is promising, but health systems supports must be improved to ensure consistent coverage and quality. Mixed-methods implementation research provided the Ministry of Health with actionable feedback that it is using to adapt program policies and improve performance.

AB BACKGROUND: The rate of elective surgeries varies dramatically by geography in the United States. For many of these surgeries, there is not clear evidence of their relative merits over alternate treatment choices and there are significant tradeoffs in short- and long-term risks and benefits of selecting one treatment option over another. Conditions and symptoms for which there is this lack of a single clear evidence-based treatment choice present great opportunities for patient and provider collaboration on decision making; back pain and joint osteoarthritis are two such ailments. A number of decision aids are in active use to encourage this shared decision-making process. Decision aids have been assessed in formal studies that demonstrate increases in patient knowledge, increases in patient-provider engagement, and reduction in surgery rates. These studies have not widely demonstrated the added benefit of health coaching in support of shared decision making nor have they commonly provided strong evidence of cost reductions. In order to add to this evidence base, we undertook a comparative study testing the relative impact on health utilization and costs of active outreach through interactive voice response technology to encourage health coaching in support of shared decision making in comparison to mailed outreach or no outreach. This study focused on individuals with back pain or joint pain.; METHODS: We conducted four waves of stratified randomized comparisons for individuals with risk for back, hip, or knee surgery who did not have claims-based evidence of one or more of five chronic conditions and were eligible for population care management services within three large regional health plans in the United States. An interactive voice response (IVR) form of outreach that included the capability for individuals to directly connect with health coaches telephonically, known as AutoDialog(), was compared to a control (mailed outreach or natural levels of inbound calling depending on the study wave). In total, the study include 24,167 adults with commercial and Medicare Advantage private coverage at three health plans and at risk for lumbar back surgery, hip repair/replacement, or knee repair/replacement.; RESULTS: Interactive voice response outreach led to 10.7 (P-value < .0001) times as many inbound calls within 30 days as the control. Over 180 days, the IVR group ("intervention") had 67 percent (P-value < .0001) more health coach communications and agreed to be sent 3.2 (P-value < .0001) time as many DVD- and/or booklet-based decision aids. Targeted surgeries were reduced by 6.7 percent (P-value = .6039). Overall costs were lower by 4.9 percent (P-value = .055). Costs that were not related to maternity, cancer, trauma and substance abuse ("actionable costs") were reduced by 6.5 percent (P-value = .0286).; CONCLUSIONS: IVR with a transfer-to-health coach-option significantly increased levels of health coaching compared to mailed or no outreach and lead to significantly reduced actionable medical costs. Providing high levels of health coaching to individuals with these types of risks appears to have produced important levels of actionable medical cost reductions. We believe this impact resulted from more informed and engaged health care decision making.

AB Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing has the potential to improve drug therapy in an individual by informing appropriate drug dosing or drug selection in order to maximize efficacy and safety. Although multiple studies have illustrated the potential benefits of such testing when applied to specific drugs across a broad range of therapy areas, the uptake of PGx testing in routine clinical practice has been relatively limited. Implementation appears to be hampered by the absence of sufficiently strong evidence linking the results of testing with actionable benefits in terms of clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, there are now adequate data to allow dosing recommendations as have been developed by bodies including the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) in several settings, including TPMT/thiopurines, CYP2C19/clopidogrel, CYP2D6/codeine, VKORC1-CYP2C9/warfarin, HLA-B*5701/abacavir, SLCO1B1/simvastatin and HLAB*5801/allopurinol. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) and the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (IATDMCT) have also recently initiated surveys in order to better understand the extent of, and the role played by, PGx testing in clinical practice. This should help identify where further training and education may be beneficial. To this end, in collaboration with ESPT, the IFCC Pharmacogenetic Laboratory Network has now been formed, with the aim of improving the uptake and quality of PGx testing.

AB The publication of the human genome, more than a decade ago, alongside the development of high-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing, marked the dawn of a new era in genetics. Large genomic projects have been initiated to decipher the mysteries hidden within the human genetic code. With the rapidly ever-growing amount of genetic information, and the importance of understanding what it all means, there is a need to generate an interdisciplinary hub that will connect researchers, both experimentalists and bioinformaticians, along with physicians and community representatives in order to develop a common genomic language. This should lead to an accessible, readable and interpretive human genome with a short list of personal actionable items. We will then be able to declare that we are moving ever closer to the point at which one's own genome will affect one's personal life at a scope beyond our current comprehension.

AB Integrated knowledge translation (IKT) requires active collaboration between researchers and the ultimate users of knowledge throughout a research process, and is being aggressively positioned as an essential strategy to address the problem of underutilization of research-derived knowledge. The purpose of this commentary is to assist potential "knowledge users", particularly those working in policy or service settings, by highlighting some of the more nuanced benefits of the IKT model, as well as some of its potential costs. Actionable outcomes may not be immediately (or ever) forthcoming, but the process of collaboration can result in group-level identity transformation that permits access to different professional perspectives as well as, we suggest, added organizational and social value. As well, the IKT approach provides space for the re-balancing of what is considered "expertise". We offer this paper to help practitioners, administrators and policymakers more realistically assess the potential benefits and costs of engaging in IKT-oriented research.

AB BACKGROUND: Kidney graft survival has never been systematically compared between Europe and the United States.; METHODS: Applying period analysis to first deceased-donor (DD) and living-donor kidney grafts from the United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for the United States and the Collaborative Transplant Study for Europe, we compared overall and age-specific 1-, 5-, and 10-year graft survival for Europeans and white, African, and Hispanic Americans for the 2005 to 2008 period. A Cox regression model was used to adjust for differences in patient characteristics.; RESULTS: For the 2005 to 2008 period, 1-year survival for DD grafts was equal (91%) between Europeans and white and Hispanic Americans, whereas it was slightly lower for African Americans (89%). In contrast, overall 5- and 10-year graft survival rates were considerably higher for Europe (77 and 56%, respectively) than for any of the three U.S. populations (whites, 71 and 46%, Hispanic, 73 and 48%, and African American, 62 and 34%). Differences were largest for recipient ages 0 to 17 and 18 to 29 and generally increased beyond 3 to 4 years after transplantation. Survival patterns for living-donor grafts were similar as those seen for DD grafts. Adjusted hazard ratios for graft failure in United Network for Organ Sharing white Americans ranged between 1.5 and 2.3 (all P<0.001) for 2 to 5 years after transplantation, indicating that lower graft survival is not explained by differences in baseline patient characteristics.; CONCLUSIONS: Long-term kidney graft survival rates are markedly lower in the United States compared with Europe. Identifying actionable factors explaining long-term graft survival differences between Europe and the United States is a high priority for improving long-term graft survival.

AB BACKGROUND: The science of dissemination and implementation (D&I) is advancing the knowledge base for how best to integrate evidence-based interventions within clinical and community settings and how to recast the nature or conduct of the research itself to make it more relevant and actionable in those settings. While the field is growing, there are only a few training programs for D&I research; this is an important avenue to help build the field's capacity. To improve the United States' capacity for D&I research, the National Institutes of Health and Veterans Health Administration collaborated to develop a five-day training institute for postdoctoral level applicants aspiring to advance this science.; METHODS: We describe the background, goals, structure, curriculum, application process, trainee evaluation, and future plans for the Training in Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (TIDIRH).; RESULTS: The TIDIRH used a five-day residential immersion to maximize opportunities for trainees and faculty to interact. The train-the-trainer-like approach was intended to equip participants with materials that they could readily take back to their home institutions to increase interest and further investment in D&I. The TIDIRH curriculum included a balance of structured large group discussions and interactive small group sessions.Thirty-five of 266 applicants for the first annual training institute were accepted from a variety of disciplines, including psychology (12 trainees); medicine (6 trainees); epidemiology (5 trainees); health behavior/health education (4 trainees); and 1 trainee each from education & human development, health policy and management, health services research, public health studies, public policy and social work, with a maximum of two individuals from any one institution. The institute was rated as very helpful by attendees, and by six months after the institute, a follow-up survey (97% return rate) revealed that 72% had initiated a new grant proposal in D&I research; 28% had received funding, and 77% had used skills from TIDIRH to influence their peers from different disciplines about D&I research through building local research networks, organizing formal presentations and symposia, teaching and by leading interdisciplinary teams to conduct D&I research.; CONCLUSIONS: The initial TIDIRH training was judged successful by trainee evaluation at the conclusion of the week's training and six-month follow-up, and plans are to continue and possibly expand the TIDIRH in coming years. Strengths are seen as the residential format, quality of the faculty and their flexibility in adjusting content to meet trainee needs, and the highlighting of concrete D&I examples by the local host institution, which rotates annually. Lessons learned and plans for future TIDIRH trainings are summarized.

AB PURPOSE: Salivary duct carcinomas (SDC) are a rare and aggressive subtype of salivary gland cancers for which cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy. We investigated whether genotyping analysis could detect novel tumor-specific mutations that would help direct SDC patient treatment using targeted agents.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We genotyped 27 SDC archival specimens from patients followed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (Boston, MA) between 2000 and 2011. These included the tumors of 8 patients who were tested prospectively. Targeted mutational analysis of 13 clinically relevant cancer genes was conducted using SNaPshot multiplexed genotyping. FISH was conducted to detect HER2 gene amplification. Patient medical records and tumor histopathologic features were retrospectively reviewed.; RESULTS: Mutually exclusive genetic aberrations were detected in 15 of 27 (56%) tumors, including 2 (7%) mutations in BRAF, 5 (19%) mutations in PIK3CA, and 8 (30%) cases of HER2 gene amplification. To our knowledge, this is the first time that BRAF and PIK3CA mutations have been reported in this tumor type. Prospective clinical testing of 8 patients with SDC identified actionable genetic alterations in 6 tumors and influenced therapeutic decisions for all 6 patients.; CONCLUSION: SNaPshot molecular profiling identified novel genetic changes in SDCs, expanded the therapeutic options for patients with this rare tumor, and is changing SDC management at our institution. These findings highlight the importance of using broad-based genetic profiling to expedite the identification of effective-targeted therapies for patients with rare malignancies. ©2012 AACR.

AB BACKGROUND: The advent of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing (GT) has sparked a number of debates regarding the scientific validity of tests, their broad health and ethical implications for society as well as their legal status. To date, relatively few empirical studies have been published regarding this phenomenon. We conducted a survey of European clinical geneticists to gauge their awareness of, experiences with, and attitudes towards DTC GT.; METHODS: We invited 300 clinical geneticists from 28 European countries to complete an online questionnaire. Statistical analyses of closed-ended questions were performed using the STATISTICA software package. Answers to open-ended questions were analysed for recurring themes.; RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one clinical geneticists answered our survey (response rate, 44%). Eighty-six percent (110/128) of respondents were aware of DTC GT, and over one-third had been contacted by at least one patient regarding these services. The majority (84%) of respondents did not agree with telephone medical supervision outside of an established doctor-patient relationship. The majority of clinical geneticists also found it unacceptable to provide non-face-to-face medical supervision for: (i) a presymptomatic test for a condition with very high penetrance; (ii) a predictive test for a condition that has a 'medium' penetrance of 50% to 60%; and (iii) carrier testing. For conditions that are neither treatable nor preventable and for disorders with serious health consequences, clinical geneticists were almost unanimous in expressing the unacceptability of offering such genetic tests outside of the traditional healthcare setting, without an established physician-patient relationship and without face-to-face medical supervision.; CONCLUSION: A high percentage of European clinical geneticists are aware of DTC GT and the majority do not agree with the model of provision used by many commercial companies for certain severe or actionable health conditions. Despite this disagreement with the DTC model of provision, >85% of respondents said that they would offer genetic counselling to patients who asked for a consultation after having undergone DTC genetic testing. The understanding of the views and opinions of this expert stakeholder group should be considered in the attempts to shape responsible policy and guidelines for these services.

AB BACKGROUND: The debate regarding the relative merits of whole genome sequencing (WGS) versus exome sequencing (ES) centers around comparative cost, average depth of coverage for each interrogated base, and their relative efficiency in the identification of medically actionable variants from the myriad of variants identified by each approach. Nevertheless, few genomes have been subjected to both WGS and ES, using multiple next generation sequencing platforms. In addition, no personal genome has been so extensively analyzed using DNA derived from peripheral blood as opposed to DNA from transformed cell lines that may either accumulate mutations during propagation or clonally expand mosaic variants during cell transformation and propagation.; METHODS: We investigated a genome that was studied previously by SOLiD chemistry using both ES and WGS, and now perform six independent ES assays (Illumina GAII (x2), Illumina HiSeq (x2), Life Technologies' Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and Proton), and one additional WGS (Illumina HiSeq).; RESULTS: We compared the variants identified by the different methods and provide insights into the differences among variants identified between ES runs in the same technology platform and among different sequencing technologies. We resolved the true genotypes of medically actionable variants identified in the proband through orthogonal experimental approaches. Furthermore, ES identified an additional SH3TC2 variant (p.M1?) that likely contributes to the phenotype in the proband.; CONCLUSIONS: ES identified additional medically actionable variant calls and helped resolve ambiguous single nucleotide variants (SNV) documenting the power of increased depth of coverage of the captured targeted regions. Comparative analyses of WGS and ES reveal that pseudogenes and segmental duplications may explain some instances of apparent disease mutations in unaffected individuals.

AB The population health approach - which has long been a cornerstone ideology for those in public health - is increasingly embraced by various actors in the healthcare sector, including but not limited to those in primary healthcare. There is much to be gained from public health's involvement in these early efforts, which could enable the pursuit of approaches that integrate both individual- and population-level interventions. These collaborative efforts could serve as the initial building blocks for transformative change, provided that others follow suit. Lessons from the study of the diffusion of innovation teach us that new ideas can spread or wither in unpredictable ways. However, the odds of success would be improved if we could (1) make population health concepts less complex and more actionable, (2) socialize early adopter activities and make them more observable to others so that they could help model the way, (3) invest in evaluation so that the benefits of the approach could be more clearly demonstrated and (4) address social and cultural barriers to adoption through opinion leaders within respective professional communities.

AB INTRODUCTION: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) testing are performed in the evaluation of breast cancer. While the clinical utility of ER as a predictive biomarker to identify patients likely to benefit from hormonal therapy is well-established, the added value of PR is less well-defined. The primary goals of our study were to assess the distribution, inter-assay reproducibility, and prognostic significance of breast cancer subtypes defined by patterns of ER and PR expression.; METHODS: We integrated gene expression microarray (GEM) and clinico-pathologic data from 20 published studies to determine the frequency (n = 4,111) and inter-assay reproducibility (n = 1,752) of ER/PR subtypes (ER+/PR+, ER+/PR-, ER-/PR-, ER-/PR+). To extend our findings, we utilized a cohort of patients from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) with ER/PR data recorded in the medical record and assessed on tissue microarrays (n = 2,011). In both datasets, we assessed the association of ER and PR expression with survival.; RESULTS: In a genome-wide analysis, progesterone receptor was among the least variable genes in ER- breast cancer. The ER-/PR+ subtype was rare (approximately 1 to 4%) and showed no significant reproducibility (Kappa = 0.02 and 0.06, in the GEM and NHS datasets, respectively). The vast majority of patients classified as ER-/PR+ in the medical record (97% and 94%, in the GEM and NHS datasets) were re-classified by a second method. In the GEM dataset (n = 2,731), progesterone receptor mRNA expression was associated with prognosis in ER+ breast cancer (adjusted P <0.001), but not in ER- breast cancer (adjusted P = 0.21). PR protein expression did not contribute significant prognostic information to multivariate models considering ER and other standard clinico-pathologic features in the GEM or NHS datasets.; CONCLUSION: ER-/PR+ breast cancer is not a reproducible subtype. PR expression is not associated with prognosis in ER- breast cancer, and PR does not contribute significant independent prognostic information to multivariate models considering ER and other standard clinico-pathologic factors. Given that PR provides no clinically actionable information in ER+ breast cancer, these findings question the utility of routine PR testing in breast cancer.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe pilot work on a semantic model of the pharmacogenomics information found in drug product labels. The model's development is driven by a series of use cases that we have developed to demonstrate how structured pharmacogenomics information could be more effectively used to support clinical and translational efforts. Using an iterative process, the semantic model was field-tested by five pharmacists, who used it to manually annotate a subset of the sections that the Food and Drug Administration's Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels cites as containing pharmacogenomics information. The five pharmacists identified a total of 213 pharmacogenomics statements in 29 sections. The model showed the potential to make the unstructured pharmacogenomic information currently written in product labeling more accessible and actionable through structured annotations of pharmacogenomics effects and clinical recommendations.

AB Radiology reports often contain findings about the condition of a patient which should be acted upon quickly. These actionable findings in a radiology report can be automatically detected to ensure that the referring physician is notified about such findings and to provide feedback to the radiologist that further action has been taken. In this paper we investigate a method for detecting actionable findings of appendicitis in radiology reports. The method identifies both individual assertions regarding the presence of appendicitis and other findings related to appendicitis using syntactic dependency patterns. All relevant individual statements from a report are collectively considered to determine whether the report is consistent with appendicitis. Evaluation on a corpus of 400 radiology reports annotated by two expert radiologists showed that our approach achieves a precision of 91%, a recall of 83%, and an F1-measure of 87%.

AB Diagnostic radiology is one of the key areas of clinical diagnosis on which much of the health care system is built. Along with pathology, radiology has a unique role in providing diagnostic information for prognosis, treatment, and management of clinical conditions. This role is clinically challenging due to the problems of knowledge management associated with the free-text radiology reports which are currently the standard of practice for radiology care. In order to address this critical knowledge management problem, we have proposed a solution using the Radiology Diagnostics Exchange Agent, which is under development and will enhance clinical care management. Using a human computation approach, we have started to identify and validate clinically actionable terms on which an information management infrastructure can be developed with important implications for clinical care and research.

AB The debate over return of individual research results and incidental findings to study participants is a key frontier in research ethics and practice. This is fundamentally a problem of translational science-a question of when information about an individual that is generated in research should be communicated for clinical attention, particularly as technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing are increasingly used in clinical care. There is growing consensus that investigators should offer participants at least those individual findings of high clinical importance and actionability. Increasing attention to what information biobanks and secondary researchers owe people who provide data and specimens offers an opportunity to treat these source individuals as research partners. Cutting-edge issues include return of results in pediatric populations and return to kin and family, both before and after the death of the proband, as well as how to manage incidental findings in clinical sequencing. Progress will require an understanding of the continuum linking research and clinical care and developing standards and models for return.

AB Disease predictive systems are intended to be management aids. With a few exceptions, these systems typically do not have direct sustained use by growers. Rather, their impact is mostly pedagogic and indirect, improving recommendations from farm advisers and shaping management concepts. The degree to which a system is consulted depends on the amount of perceived new, actionable information that is consistent with the objectives of the user. Often this involves avoiding risks associated with costly disease outbreaks. Adoption is sensitive to the correspondence between the information a system delivers and the information needed to manage a particular pathosystem at an acceptable financial risk; details of the approach used to predict disease risk are less important. The continuing challenge for researchers is to construct tools relevant to farmers and their advisers that improve upon their current management skill. This goal requires an appreciation of growers' decision calculus in managing disease problems and, more broadly, their overall farm enterprise management.

AB BACKGROUND: Oncogenic mechanisms in small-cell lung cancer remain poorly understood leaving this tumor with the worst prognosis among all lung cancers. Unlike other cancer types, sequencing genomic approaches have been of limited success in small-cell lung cancer, i.e., no mutated oncogenes with potential driver characteristics have emerged, as it is the case for activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor in non-small-cell lung cancer. Differential gene expression analysis has also produced SCLC signatures with limited application, since they are generally not robust across datasets. Nonetheless, additional genomic approaches are warranted, due to the increasing availability of suitable small-cell lung cancer datasets. Gene co-expression network approaches are a recent and promising avenue, since they have been successful in identifying gene modules that drive phenotypic traits in several biological systems, including other cancer types.; RESULTS: We derived an SCLC-specific classifier from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of a lung cancer dataset. The classifier, termed SCLC-specific hub network (SSHN), robustly separates SCLC from other lung cancer types across multiple datasets and multiple platforms, including RNA-seq and shotgun proteomics. The classifier was also conserved in SCLC cell lines. SSHN is enriched for co-expressed signaling network hubs strongly associated with the SCLC phenotype. Twenty of these hubs are actionable kinases with oncogenic potential, among which spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) exhibits one of the highest overall statistical associations to SCLC. In patient tissue microarrays and cell lines, SCLC can be separated into SYK-positive and -negative. SYK siRNA decreases proliferation rate and increases cell death of SYK-positive SCLC cell lines, suggesting a role for SYK as an oncogenic driver in a subset of SCLC.; CONCLUSIONS: SCLC treatment has thus far been limited to chemotherapy and radiation. Our WGCNA analysis identifies SYK both as a candidate biomarker to stratify SCLC patients and as a potential therapeutic target. In summary, WGCNA represents an alternative strategy to large scale sequencing for the identification of potential oncogenic drivers, based on a systems view of signaling networks. This strategy is especially useful in cancer types where no actionable mutations have emerged.

AB Large-scale collaborative initiatives using next-generation DNA sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have begun to characterize the genomic landscape of breast cancer. These landmark studies have identified infrequent driver mutations that are potential targets for therapeutic intervention with approved or investigational drug treatments, among other important discoveries. Recently, many institutions have launched molecular screening programs that apply high-throughput genomic technologies to patients with advanced solid malignancies, including breast cancer, to inform clinical decision-making. This article provides an overview of the recent molecular insights in breast cancer, including potentially actionable somatic alterations, the technological platforms currently available in a clinical diagnostics setting to detect these alterations, and ongoing institutional or regional molecular screening programs in advanced breast cancer.

AB This paper examines the concept of free will, or independent action, in light of recent research in psychology and neuroscience. Reviewing findings in memory, prospection, and mental simulation, as well as the neurological mechanisms underlying behavioral control, planning, and integration, it is suggested in accord with previous arguments (e.g., Wegner, 2003; Harris, 2012) that a folk conception of free will as entirely conscious control over behavior should be rejected. However, it is argued that, when taken together, these findings can also support an alternative conception of free will. The constructive nature of memory and an integrative "default network" provide the means for novel and creative combinations of information, such as the imagining of counterfactual scenarios and alternative courses of action. Considering recent findings of extensive functional connections between these systems and those that subsume motor control and goal maintenance, it is argued that individuals have the capability of producing novel ideas and translating them into actionable goals. Although most of these processes take place beneath conscious awareness, it is argued that they are unique to the individual and thus, can be considered a form of independent control over behavior, or free will.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review from an architectural lighting perspective the effects of indoor lighting on the health and well-being of people in senior living environments.; BACKGROUND: The role of circadian rhythms in people with chronic disorders continues to be a focus of laboratory research and clinical trials. Beneficial, evidence-based indoor lighting design strategies are being considered for senior living environments, particularly for residents who have limited access to natural bright light.; METHODS: Articles published 2002-2012 reporting the results of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were accessed using the U.S. National Library of Medicine PubMed site using the following search terms: "light, sleep, circadian, randomized, controlled, nursing home" and "light, sleep, circadian, randomized, controlled, elderly."; RESULTS: The search resulted in 48 citations, of which 18 meet our pre-search criteria. Data from these RCTs indicate options such as programmable, 24-hour lighting algorithms that may involve light intensity, lighting duration, spectra (wavelength) and lighting timing sequences; CONCLUSIONS: Valid and actionable data are available about circadian rhythms, sleep, and human health and well-being that can inform the design of lighting for long-term care. Evidence-based architectural design of a 24-hour light/dark environment for residents may mitigate symptoms of circadian disruption; evidence-based management of darkness is as important as evidence-based management of light. Further research is needed into the long-term circadian health needs of night staff members in order to understand the effects of shift work while, at the same time providing the highest level of care.; KEYWORDS: Design process, elderly, evidence-based design, lighting, literature review.

AB PURPOSE: This paper's aim is to evaluate the perceived impact and the enabling factors and barriers experienced by hospital staff participating in an international hospital performance measurement project focused on internal quality improvement.; DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Semi-structured interviews involving international hospital performance measurement project coordinators, including 140 hospitals from eight European countries (Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia). Inductively analyzing the interview transcripts was carried out using the grounded theory approach.; FINDINGS: Even when public reporting is absent, the project was perceived as having stimulated performance measurement and quality improvement initiatives in participating hospitals. Attention should be paid to leadership/ownership, context, content (project intrinsic features) and processes supporting elements.; RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Generalizing the findings is limited by the study's small sample size. Possible implications for the WHO European Regional Office and for participating hospitals would be to assess hospital preparedness to participate in the PATH project, depending on context, process and structural elements; and enhance performance and practice benchmarking through suggested approaches.; ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This research gathered rich and unique material related to an international performance measurement project. It derived actionable findings.

AB Bladder symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence are common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). These symptoms, which often result from neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), can have a major impact on patients' day-to-day lives. However, in many cases they are over-looked in the clinical management of MS. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a reliable, sensitive, and specific screening tool for patients with bladder problems related to MS. We performed a literature review and then conducted a content validation study followed by a multisite observational study of a new screening tool, the Actionable Bladder Symptom Screening Tool (ABSST). All ABSST domains as well as the total score met the threshold for good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha ≥ 0.70), with a Cronbach alpha value of 0.95 for the total score and values ranging from 0.85 to 0.90 for the three domains. The validity of the ABSST was demonstrated by high correlation of the domains and total score with the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form (OAB-q SF) Symptom Severity and Total Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scores (Spearman correlation coefficient ≥ 0.782). The predictive validity of the ABSST total score to identify patients who might receive a recommendation to see a urologist was strong. This new instrument, which was developed with input from clinicians as well as MS patients, meets the current content validity and psychometric testing thresholds established by the US Food and Drug Administration, with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB BACKGROUND: Continuous improvements of IT-performance in healthcare organisations require actionable performance indicators, regularly conducted, independent measurements and meaningful and scalable reference groups. Existing IT-benchmarking initiatives have focussed on the development of reliable and valid indicators, but less on the questions about how to implement an environment for conducting easily repeatable and scalable IT-benchmarks.; OBJECTIVES: This study aims at developing and trialling a procedure that meets the afore-mentioned requirements.; METHODS: We chose a well established, regularly conducted (inter-) national IT-survey of healthcare organisations (IT-Report Healthcare) as the environment and offered the participants of the 2011 survey (CIOs of hospitals) to enter a benchmark. The 61 structural and functional performance indicators covered among others the implementation status and integration of IT-systems and functions, global user satisfaction and the resources of the IT-department. Healthcare organisations were grouped by size and ownership. The benchmark results were made available electronically and feedback on the use of these results was requested after several months.; RESULTS: Fifty-ninehospitals participated in the benchmarking. Reference groups consisted of up to 141 members depending on the number of beds (size) and the ownership (public vs. private). A total of 122 charts showing single indicator frequency views were sent to each participant. The evaluation showed that 94.1% of the CIOs who participated in the evaluation considered this benchmarking beneficial and reported that they would enter again. Based on the feedback of the participants we developed two additional views that provide a more consolidated picture.; CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that establishing an independent, easily repeatable and scalable IT-benchmarking procedure is possible and was deemed desirable. Based on these encouraging results a new benchmarking round which includes process indicators is currently conducted.

AB Approximately 466,000 West Virginians, or about 25 percent of the state population, have prediabetes and are at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Appropriate lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes if individuals at risk are identified and treated early. The West Virginia Diabetes Prevention and Control Program and the West Virginia University Office of Health Services Research are developing a systematic approach to diabetes prevention within primary care. This study aims to demonstrate the viability of patient registry software for the analysis of disparate electronic health record (EHR) data sets and standardized identification of at-risk patients for early detection and intervention. Preliminary analysis revealed that of 94,283 patients without a documented diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes, 10,673 (11.3 percent) meet one or more of the risk criteria. This study indicates that EHR data can be repurposed into an actionable registry for prevention. This model supports meaningful use of EHRs, the Patient-Centered Medical Home program, and improved care through enhanced data management.

AB BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of molecular targeted agents is modest in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficacy of molecular targeted therapies has been better in cancer patients with high expression of actionable molecules defined as cognate target molecules. However, patient stratification based on the actionable molecules dictating the effectiveness of targeted drugs has remained understudied in HCC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & RESULTS: Paired tumor and non-tumoral tissues derived from a total of 130 HCC patients were studied. Real-time RT-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of actionable molecules in the tissues. mRNA levels of EGFR, VEGFR2, PDGFRbeta, FGFR1, and mTOR were up-regulated in tumors compared to non-tumors in 35.4, 42.3, 61.5, 24.6, and 50.0% of patients, respectively. Up-regulation of EGFR was observed at early stage and tended to gradually decrease toward late stages (BCLC stage A: 41.9%; B: 30.8%; C: 17.6%). Frequency of VEGFR2 expression in tumors at stage C was lower than that in the other stages (BCLC stage A: 45.9%; B: 41.0%; C: 29.4%). PDGFRbeta and mTOR were observed to be up-regulated in more than 50% of tumors in all the stages whereas FGFR1 was up-regulated in only about 20% of HCC irrespective of stages. A cluster analysis of actionable gene expression revealed that HCC can be categorized into different subtypes that predict the effectiveness of molecular targeted agents and combination therapies in clinical trials. Analysis of in vitro sensitivity to sorafenib demonstrated that HCC cells with up-regulation of PDGFRbeta and c-Raf mRNA are more susceptible to sorafenib treatment in a dose and time-dependent manner than cells with low expression of the genes.; CONCLUSIONS: mRNA expression analysis of actionable molecules could provide the rationale for new companion diagnostics-based therapeutic strategies in the treatment of HCC.

AB Astrocytoma is the most common glioma, accounting for half of all primary brain and spinal cord tumors. Late detection and the aggressive nature of high-grade astrocytomas contribute to high mortality rates. Though many studies identify candidate biomarkers using high-throughput transcriptomic profiling to stratify grades and subtypes, few have resulted in clinically actionable results. This shortcoming can be attributed, in part, to pronounced lab effects that reduce signature robustness and varied individual gene expression among patients with the same tumor. We addressed these issues by uniformly preprocessing publicly available transcriptomic data, comprising 306 tumor samples from three astrocytoma grades (Grade 2, 3, and 4) and 30 non-tumor samples (normal brain as control tissues). Utilizing Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC), a network-based classification approach, we examined the global and individual patterns of network regulation across tumor grades. Additionally, we applied gene-based approaches to identify genes whose expression changed consistently with increasing tumor grade and evaluated their robustness across multiple studies using statistical sampling. Applying DIRAC, we observed a global trend of greater network dysregulation with increasing tumor aggressiveness. Individual networks displaying greater differences in regulation between adjacent grades play well-known roles in calcium/PKC, EGF, and transcription signaling. Interestingly, many of the 90 individual genes found to monotonically increase or decrease with astrocytoma grade are implicated in cancer-affected processes such as calcium signaling, mitochondrial metabolism, and apoptosis. The fact that specific genes monotonically increase or decrease with increasing astrocytoma grade may reflect shared oncogenic mechanisms among phenotypically similar tumors. This work presents statistically significant results that enable better characterization of different human astrocytoma grades and hopefully can contribute towards improvements in diagnosis and therapy choices. Our results also identify a number of testable hypotheses relating to astrocytoma etiology that may prove helpful in developing much-needed biomarkers for earlier disease detection.

AB OBJECTIVES: The frequency of common oncogenic mutations and TP53 was determined in Asian oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The OncoCarta() panel v1.0 assay was used to characterize oncogenic mutations. In addition, exons 4-11 of the TP53 gene were sequenced. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify associations between mutations and selected clinico-pathological characteristics and risk habits.; RESULTS: Oncogenic mutations were detected in PIK3CA (5.7%) and HRAS (2.4%). Mutations in TP53 were observed in 27.7% (31/112) of the OSCC specimens. Oncogenic mutations were found more frequently in non-smokers (p = 0.049) and TP53 truncating mutations were more common in patients with no risk habits (p = 0.019). Patients with mutations had worse overall survival compared to those with absence of mutations; and patients who harbored DNA binding domain (DBD) and L2/L3/LSH mutations showed a worse survival probability compared to those patients with wild type TP53. The majority of the oncogenic and TP53 mutations were G:C > A:T and A:T > G:C base transitions, regardless of the different risk habits.; CONCLUSION: Hotspot oncogenic mutations which are frequently present in common solid tumors are exceedingly rare in OSCC. Despite differences in risk habit exposure, the mutation frequency of PIK3CA and HRAS in Asian OSCC were similar to that reported in OSCC among Caucasians, whereas TP53 mutations rates were significantly lower. The lack of actionable hotspot mutations argue strongly for the need to comprehensively characterize gene mutations associated with OSCC for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

AB Psychiatry is in a time of crisis. The absence of significant breakthroughs to actionable etiological knowledge has left the discipline in a state of uncertainty and worries are being voiced about its status and future. In our view, the stagnation can be, at least in part, ascribed to an excessive, behaviorist-oriented, epistemological, and ontological simplification of psychopathology. The aim of this phenomenological study is to articulate the notion of the 'disordered self' in schizophrenia, a notion that we believe constitutes an important step forward in grasping its essential pathogenetic structures. Through the framework of self-disorders, we analyze two domains of the psychopathology of schizophrenia, seeking to recast their puzzling nature into more useful clinical and scientific terms. First, we examine the so-called schizophrenic incomprehensibility (bizarre gestalt, bizarre delusions, and 'crazy actions') and argue that grasping the altered framework for experiencing, associated with the disordered self, makes these phenomena appear comprehensible to a considerable extent. Second, we explore the issue of treatment noncompliance and provide a novel account of 'poor insight' into illness. We propose that poor insight into schizophrenia is not simply a problem of insufficient self- reflection due to psychological defenses or impaired metacognition, but rather that it is intrinsically expressive of the severity and nature of self-disorders. The instabilities of the first-person perspective throw the patient into a different, often quasisolipsistic, ontological-existential framework. We argue that interventions seeking to optimize the patients' compliance might prove more efficient if they take the alterations of the patients' ontological-existential framework into account. © 2013 S.

AB BACKGROUND: In this study, we examined how biobank study participants, who were found to have long QT syndrome (LQTS), a potentially life-threatening but treatable cardiac arrhythmia condition, experienced the process of disclosure of unexpected results and referral to health care.; METHODS: All 27 subjects with a LQTS mutation finding were asked to complete a questionnaire. Four participants did not uptake the re-testing and 5 others did not respond to the questionnaire. We received 17 questionnaires from 6 males and 11 females, aged 46-82; 5 of them were also willing to participate in qualitative interviews.; RESULTS: Of the respondents, 16/17 had experienced the process of receiving the results as positive and useful, especially if they had had symptoms. One respondent experienced the process negatively due to concerns related to informing her children. All respondents felt that genetic results should be reported back to the participants, while 2 indicated that this should occur only in the case of treatable conditions. Respondents had informed all of their children about the genetic condition, except 2 minors.; CONCLUSIONS: The respondents from a population biobank study who were informed about an unexpected genetic finding evaluated this process as mainly positive. They considered that delivering genetic information about a life-threatening but actionable condition has more beneficial than adverse consequences. The feedback policy for biobanks should include how and who is informed, advise treatment or care pathways for actionable findings, and it should also include suitable options for those who do not want to know about such findings. © 2013 S.

AB Traditionally, rule interactions are handled at implementation time through rule task properties that control the order in which rules are executed. By doing so, knowledge about the behavior and interactions of decision rules is not captured at modeling time. We argue that this is important knowledge that should be integrated in the modeling phase. In this project, we build upon current work on a conceptual schema to represent clinical knowledge for decision support in the form of if <formula></formula> then rules. This schema currently captures provenance of the clinical content, context where such content is actionable (i.e. constraints) and the logic of the rule itself. For this project, we borrowed concepts from both the Semantic Web (i.e., Ontologies) and Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), to explore a conceptual approach for modeling rule interactions in an enterprise-wide clinical setting. We expect that a more comprehensive modeling will facilitate knowledge authoring, editing and update; foster consistency in rules implementation and maintenance; and develop authoritative knowledge repositories to promote quality, safety and efficacy of healthcare.

AB BACKGROUND: Healthcare organisations are an enigma to many people inand outside the service. Organisational fuzziness is a common state, characterised by a lack of clarity, lack of awareness, lack of organisational knowledge, and the reliance on practice and custom instead of transparency.; AIMS: The objective of this study was to obtain a better understanding of what causes this fuzziness and provide an actionable description of fuzzy organisations. Such a description is essential to managing and preventing organisational fuzziness.; METHOD: We used a longitudinal case study in an integrated healthand social care organisation to obtain a thorough understanding of how the organisation functions. These indepth insights allowed the identification of three generators of fuzziness.; RESULTS: We found that the three main generators of organisational fuzziness are change, informal organisation and complexity. Organisational fuzziness is thus partly due to the inherent complexities of human systems. However, also continuous change and the inability of the system to adapt its formal structures resulted in structures deteriorating or no longer being appropriate.; CONCLUSION: Existing approaches to explain unclear or absent structures in healthcare organisations by describing these organisations as complex adaptive systems (CAS) are too simplistic. While aspects relating to people and their interactions are indeed complex, fuzziness of structural aspects are often the result of continuous change and insufficient organisational capacity to adapt to it.

AB Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) has been shown to confer a survival advantage in two randomized clinical trials and a meta-analysis. Despite level 1 evidence supporting its benefit, utilization remains dismal with nearly one-half of patients ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy because of renal dysfunction, impaired performance status, and/or coexisting medical problems. This situation highlights the need for the development of novel therapies for the management of MIBC, a disease with a lethal phenotype. The neoadjuvant paradigm in bladder cancer offers many advantages for accelerated drug development. First, there is a greater likelihood of successful therapy at an earlier disease state that may be characterized by less genomic instability compared with the metastatic setting, with an early readout of activity with results determined in months rather than years. Second, pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue collection in patients with MIBC is performed as the standard of care without the need for research-directed biopsies, allowing for the ability to perform important correlative studies and to monitor tumor response to therapy in "real time." Third, pathological complete response (pT0) predicts for improved outcome in patients with MIBC. Fourth, there is a strong biological rationale with rapidly accumulating evidence for actionable targets in bladder cancer. This review focuses on the neoadjuvant paradigm for accelerated drug development using bladder cancer as the ideal model.

AB OBJECTIVE: To revise the "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Sustained Use of Sedatives and Analgesics in the Critically Ill Adult" published in Critical Care Medicine in 2002.; METHODS: The American College of Critical Care Medicine assembled a 20-person, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional task force with expertise in guideline development, pain, agitation and sedation, delirium management, and associated outcomes in adult critically ill patients. The task force, divided into four subcommittees, collaborated over six years in person, via teleconferences, and via electronic communication. Subcommittees were responsible for developing relevant clinical questions, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method (www.gradeworkinggroup.org) to review, evaluate, and summarize the literature, and to develop clinical statements (descriptive) and recommendations (actionable). With the help of a professional librarian and Refworks database software, they developed a Web-based electronic database of over 19,000 references extracted from eight clinical search engines, related to pain and analgesia, agitation and sedation, delirium, and related clinical outcomes in adult ICU patients. The group also used psychometric analyses to evaluate and compare pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium assessment tools. All task force members were allowed to review the literature supporting each statement and recommendation and provided feedback to the subcommittees. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations using the nominal group technique and the modified Delphi method, with anonymous voting by all task force members using E-Survey (www.esurvey.com). All voting was completed in December 2010. Relevant studies published after this date and prior to publication of these guidelines were referenced in the text. The quality of evidence for each statement and recommendation was ranked as high (A), moderate (B), or low/very low (C). The strength of recommendations was ranked as strong (1) or weak (2) and either in favor of (+) or against (-) an intervention. A strong recommendation (either for or against) indicated that the intervention's desirable effects either clearly outweighed its undesirable effects (risks, burdens, and costs) or it did not. For all strong recommendations, the phrase "We recommend..." is used throughout. A weak recommendation, either for or against an intervention, indicated that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects was less clear. For all weak recommendations, the phrase "We suggest..." is used throughout. In the absence of sufficient evidence, or when group consensus could not be achieved, no recommendation (0) was made. Consensus based on expert opinion was not used as a substitute for a lack of evidence. A consistent method for addressing potential conflicts of interest was followed if task force members were coauthors of related research. The development of this guideline was independent of any industry funding.; CONCLUSION: These guidelines provide a roadmap for developing integrated, evidence-based, and patient-centered protocols for preventing and treating pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis (HD) access is considered a critical and actionable determinant of morbidity, with a growing literature suggesting that initial HD access type is an important marker of long-term outcomes. Accordingly, we examined HD access during the incident dialysis period, focusing on infection risk and successful fistula creation during the first dialysis year.; STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort.; SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All US adults admitted to Fresenius Medical Care North America facilities within 15 days of first maintenance dialysis session between January 1 and December 31, 2007.; PREDICTOR: Vascular access type at HD therapy initiation.; OUTCOMES: Vascular access type at 90 days and at the end of the first year on HD therapy, bloodstream infection within the first year by access type, and catheter complication rate.; RESULTS: Of 25,003 incident dialysis patients studied, 19,622 (78.5%) initiated dialysis with a catheter; 4,151 (16.6%), with a fistula; and 1,230 (4.9%), with a graft. At 90 days, 14,105 (69.7%) had a catheter, 4,432 (21.9%) had a fistula, and 1,705 (8.4%) had a graft. Functioning fistulas and grafts at dialysis therapy initiation had first-year failure rates of 10% and 15%, respectively. Grafts were seldom replaced by fistulas (3%), whereas 7,064 (47.6%) of all patients who initiated with a catheter alone still had only a catheter at 1 year. Overall, 3,327 (13.3%) patients had at least one positive blood culture during follow-up, with the risk being similar between the fistula and graft groups, but approximately 3-fold higher in patients with a catheter (P<0.001 for either comparison). Nearly 1 in 3 catheters (32.5%) will require tissue plasminogen activator use by a median of 41 days, with 59% requiring more than one tissue plasminogen activator administration.; LIMITATIONS: Potential underestimation of bacteremia because follow-up blood culture results did not include samples sent to local laboratories.; CONCLUSIONS: In a large and representative population of incident US dialysis patients, catheter use remains very high during the first year of HD care and is associated with high mechanical complication and bloodstream infection rates.

AB Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) detected in the bone marrow (BM) of breast cancer patients identify women at high risk of recurrence. DTCs are traditionally detected by immunocytochemical staining for cytokeratins or single gene expression measurements, which limit both specificity and sensitivity. We evaluated the Nanostring nCounter platform for multi-marker, gene expression-based detection and classification of DTCs in the BM of breast cancer patients. Candidate genes exhibiting tumor cell-specific expression were identified from microarray datasets and validated by qRT-PCR analysis in non-malignant human BM and identical samples spiked with predefined numbers of molecularly diverse breast tumor cell lines. Thirty-eight validated transcripts were designed for the nCounter platform and a subset of these transcripts was technically validated against qRT-PCR measurements using identical spiked BM controls. Bilateral iliac crest BM aspirates were collected and analyzed from twenty breast cancer patients, prior to neoadjuvant therapy, using the full 38-gene nCounter code set. Tumor cell-specific gene expression by nCounter was detected with a sensitivity of one cancer cell per 1 * 10(6) nucleated BM cells after optimization. Measurements were quantitative, log linear over a 20-fold range, and correlated with qRT-PCR measurements. Using the nCounter 38-gene panel, 6 of 8 patients (75 %) who developed metastatic disease had detectable expression of at least one transcript. Notably, three of these patients had detectable expression of ERBB2 in their BM, despite the fact that their corresponding primary tumors were HER2/ERBB2 negative and therefore did not receive trastuzumab therapy. Four of these patients also expressed the PTCH1 receptor, a newly recognized therapeutic target based on hedgehog signaling pathway inhibition. The presumptive detection and classification of DTCs in the BM of breast cancer patients, based on sensitive and quantitative multi-marker detection of gene expression using the nCounter platform, provide an opportunity to both predict early distant recurrence and, more importantly, identify opportunities for preventing the spread of disease based on the expression of unique, therapeutically actionable gene targets. This study demonstrates the application of a new technology for multiplexed gene expression-based detection of DTCs in the BM of breast cancer patients and identifies at least two therapeutically targetable genes that are frequently expressed in the BM of patients who develop metastatic disease.

AB BACKGROUND: The practice of personalized medicine has made large strides since the introduction of high-throughput technologies and the vast improvements in computational biotechnology. The personalized-medicine approach to cancer management holds promise for earlier disease detection, accurate prediction of prognosis, and better treatment options; however, the early experience with personalized medicine has revealed important concerns that need to be addressed before research findings can be translated to the bedside.; CONTENT: We discuss several emerging "practical" or "focused" applications of personalized medicine. Molecular testing can have an important positive impact on health and disease management in a number of ways, and the list of specific applications is evolving. This list includes improvements in risk assessment, disease prevention, identification of new disease-related mutations, accurate disease classification based on molecular signatures, selection of patients for enrollment in clinical trials, and development of new targeted therapies, especially for metastatic tumors that are refractory to treatment. Several challenges remain to be addressed before genomics information can be applied successfully in the routine clinical management of cancers. Further improvements and investigations are needed in data interpretation, extraction of actionable items, cost-effectiveness, how to account for patient heterogeneity and ethnic variation, and how to handle the risk of "incidental findings" in genetic testing.; SUMMARY: It is now clear that personalized medicine will not immediately provide a permanent solution for patient management and that further refinement in the applications of personalized medicine will be needed to address and focus on specific issues. © 2012 American Association for Clinical Chemistry

AB Genome-wide association studies discovered numerous genetic variants significantly associated with various phenotypes. However, significant signals explain only a small portion of the variation in many traits. One explanation is that missing variation is found in "suggestive signals," i.e., variants with reasonably small P-values. However, it is not clear how to capture this information and use it optimally to design and analyze future studies. We propose to extract the available information from a genome scan by accurately estimating the means of univariate statistics. The means are estimated by: (i) computing the sum of squares (SS) of a genome scan's univariate statistics, (ii) using SS to estimate the expected SS for the means (SSM) of univariate statistics, and (iii) constructing accurate soft threshold (ST) estimators for means of univariate statistics by requiring that the SS of these estimators equals the SSM. When compared to competitors, ST estimators explain a substantially higher fraction of the variability in true means. The accuracy of proposed estimators can be used to design two-tier follow-up studies in which regions close to variants having ST-estimated means above a certain threshold are sequenced at high coverage and the rest of the genome is sequenced at low coverage. This follow-up approach reduces the sequencing burden by at least an order of magnitude when compared to a high coverage sequencing of the whole genome. Finally, we suggest ways in which ST methodology can be used to improve signal detection in future sequencing studies and to perform general statistical model selection. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB PURPOSE: Mutational load of susceptibility variants has not been studied on a genomic scale in a clinical population, nor has the potential to identify these mutations as incidental findings during clinical testing been systematically ascertained.; METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridization, a method for genome-wide detection of DNA copy-number variants, was performed clinically on DNA from 9,005 individuals. Copy-number variants encompassing or disrupting single genes were identified and analyzed for their potential to confer predisposition to dominant, adult-onset disease. Multigene copy-number variants affecting dominant, adult-onset cancer syndrome genes were also assessed.; RESULTS: In our cohort, 83 single-gene copy-number variants affected 40 unique genes associated with dominant, adult-onset disorders and unrelated to the patients' referring diagnoses (i.e., incidental) were found. Fourteen of these copy-number variants are likely disease-predisposing, 25 are likely benign, and 44 are of unknown clinical consequence. When incidental copy-number variants spanning up to 20 genes were considered, 27 copy-number variants affected 17 unique genes associated with dominant, adult-onset cancer predisposition.; CONCLUSION: Copy-number variants potentially conferring susceptibility to adult-onset disease can be identified as incidental findings during routine genome-wide testing. Some of these mutations may be medically actionable, enabling disease surveillance or prevention; however, most incidentally observed single-gene copy-number variants are currently of unclear significance to the patient.

AB The dramatic reductions in DNA sequencing costs allow us to delve deeper into the genomic alterations that increase susceptibility to many polygenic cardiovascular diseases. One such condition is an abnormal proximal aorta. Until recently, many believed that dilated, distorted or dissected proximal aortas might represent a forme fruste of Marfan syndrome or a continuum of aortopathy. Although an FBN-1 mutation does not guarantee the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome it is clear however that FBN-1 mutations independently confer additional risk for many of the cardiovascular complications classically associated with the disease. Furthermore, treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker has proven effective in reducing rates of thoracic aortic root dilatation in preliminary studies of Marfan syndrome patients. Awareness of an FBN-1 mutation then highlights the need for increased vigilance for the associated cardiovascular phenotypes. Knowledge of an FBN-1 gene mutation may allow actionable interventions earlier in the natural history of the condition.

AB Breakthroughs in molecular profiling technologies are enabling a new data-intensive approach to biomedical research, with the potential to revolutionize how we study, manage, and treat complex diseases. The next great challenge for clinical applications of these innovations will be to create scalable computational solutions for intelligently linking complex biomedical patient data to clinically actionable knowledge. Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are not well suited to representing complex syntactic and semantic relationships in unstructured biomedical information, introducing barriers to realizing such solutions. We propose a scalable computational framework for addressing this need, which leverages a hypergraph-based data model and query language that may be better suited for representing complex multi-lateral, multi-scalar, and multi-dimensional relationships. We also discuss how this framework can be used to create rapid learning knowledge base systems to intelligently capture and relate complex patient data to biomedical knowledge in order to automate the recovery of clinically actionable information.

AB Large-scale cancer genome sequencing has uncovered thousands of gene mutations, but distinguishing tumor driver genes from functionally neutral passenger mutations is a major challenge. We analyzed 800 cancer genomes of eight types to find single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that precisely target phosphorylation machinery, important in cancer development and drug targeting. Assuming that cancer-related biological systems involve unexpectedly frequent mutations, we used novel algorithms to identify genes with significant phosphorylation-associated SNVs (pSNVs), phospho-mutated pathways, kinase networks, drug targets, and clinically correlated signaling modules. We highlight increased survival of patients with TP53 pSNVs, hierarchically organized cancer kinase modules, a novel pSNV in EGFR, and an immune-related network of pSNVs that correlates with prolonged survival in ovarian cancer. Our findings include multiple actionable cancer gene candidates (FLNB, GRM1, POU2F1), protein complexes (HCF1, ASF1), and kinases (PRKCZ). This study demonstrates new ways of interpreting cancer genomes and presents new leads for cancer research.

AB INTRODUCTION: Falls can cause injury and may compromise function in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. Weakness and gait variability are associated with falls in other neurological disorders, and fatigue is well documented in SMA. The relationship of weakness, fatigue, and gait variability to falls has never been investigated.; METHODS: Seven ambulatory patients with SMA completed a falls history questionnaire, 6MWT, gait analysis, and strength testing. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between these variables.; RESULTS: All 7 subjects reported falls in the previous year. Stride-length variability was significantly associated with falls, unlike strength, fatigue, or other gait variables.; CONCLUSIONS: Stride-length variability was the key variable associated with falls. Preventive strategies to avoid falls should be incorporated into patient management plans. Gait analysis provides actionable information not revealed by standard assessments and should be included in clinical trials designed to address the prevention of falls in the SMA population.

AB BACKGROUND: Guidelines translate best evidence into best practice. A well-crafted guideline promotes quality by reducing health care variations, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective-or potentially harmful-interventions. Despite a plethora of published guidelines, methodology is often poorly defined and varies greatly within and among organizations.; PURPOSE: The third edition of this manual describes the principles and practices used successfully by the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation to produce quality-driven, evidence-based guidelines using efficient and transparent methodology for actionable recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. The development process emphasizes a logical sequence of key action statements supported by amplifying text, action statement profiles, and recommendation grades linking action to evidence. New material in this edition includes standards for trustworthy guidelines, updated classification of evidence levels, increased patient and public involvement, assessing confidence in the evidence, documenting differences of opinion, expanded discussion of conflict of interest, and use of computerized decision support for crafting actionable recommendations.; CONCLUSION: As clinical practice guidelines become more prominent as a key metric of quality health care, organizations must develop efficient production strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians must become savvy in understanding what guidelines are--and are not--and how they are best used to improve care. The information in this manual should help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.

AB OBJECTIVE: Evidence documenting management of incidental findings (IFs) from clinical genomic testing is limited. The aim of this study was to examine genetics specialists' perspectives regarding current and preferred disclosure of clinical genomic IFs.; METHODS: 50 genetics specialists, including medical geneticists, laboratory professionals, genetic counselors, and nurses participated in structured telephone interviews. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics.; RESULTS: Most specialists had encountered IFs, but definitions of IFs varied. They discussed challenges with informing patients about the prospect of IFs and disclosing IFs to patients. Causing psychological harm to patients was a concern. Participants were divided on whether IFs needed to be clinically significant and/or actionable in order to be disclosed to patients. Creating formal disclosure guidelines was considered useful, but only if they were flexible. Additional counseling, more interdisciplinary communication, maintaining contact with patients, and a centralized database to interpret IFs were also proposed.; CONCLUSION: Genetics specialists offer insights into the challenges of defining IFs, knowing when and how to disclose them, and the potential need for flexible disclosure guidelines.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Further discussion between practicing genetics specialists is needed to develop consensus on the development of best-practice guidelines for IF management.

AB Background. Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases. Benefits and risks of providing this information directly to consumers are unknown. Methods. To assess and quantify emotional and behavioral reactions of consumers to their 23andMe Personal Genome Service() report of three BRCA mutations that are common in Ashkenazi Jews, we invited all 136 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-positive individuals in the 23andMe customer database who had chosen to view their BRCA reports to participate in this IRB-approved study. We also invited 160 mutation-negative customers who were matched for age, sex and ancestry. Semi-structured phone interviews were completed for 32 mutation carriers, 16 women and 16 men, and 31 non-carriers. Questions addressed personal and family history of cancer, decision and timing of viewing the BRCA report, recollection of the result, emotional responses, perception of personal cancer risk, information sharing, and actions taken or planned. Results. Eleven women and 14 men had received the unexpected result that they are carriers of a BRCA1 185delAG or 5382insC, or BRCA2 6174delT mutation. None of them reported extreme anxiety and four experienced moderate anxiety that was transitory. Remarkably, five women and six men described their response as neutral. Most carrier women sought medical advice and four underwent risk-reducing procedures after confirmatory mutation testing. Male carriers realized that their test results implied genetic risk for female relatives, and several of them felt considerably burdened by this fact. Sharing mutation information with family members led to screening of at least 30 relatives and identification of 13 additional carriers. Non-carriers did not report inappropriate actions, such as foregoing cancer screening. All but one of the 32 mutation-positive participants appreciated learning their BRCA mutation status. Conclusions. Direct access to BRCA mutation tests, considered a model for high-risk actionable genetic tests of proven clinical utility, provided clear benefits to participants. The unexpected information demonstrated a cascade effect as relatives of newly identified carriers also sought testing and more mutation carriers were identified. Given the absence of evidence for serious emotional distress or inappropriate actions in this subset of mutation-positive customers who agreed to be interviewed for this study, broader screening of Ashkenazi Jewish women for these three BRCA mutations should be considered.

AB INTRODUCTION: The sensitivity of CT based lung cancer screening for the detection of early lung cancer is balanced by the high number of benign lung nodules identified, the unknown consequences of radiation from the test, and the potential costs of a CT based screening program. CAD chest radiography may improve the sensitivity of standard chest radiography while minimizing the risks of CT based screening.; METHODS: Study subjects were age 40-75 years with 10+ pack-years of smoking and/or an additional risk for developing lung cancer. Subjects were randomized to receive a PA view chest radiograph or placebo control (went through the process of being imaged but were not imaged). Images were reviewed first without then with the assistance of CAD. Actionable nodules were reported and additional evaluation was tracked. The primary outcome was the rate of developing symptomatic advanced stage lung cancer.; RESULTS: 1,424 subjects were enrolled. 710 received a CAD chest radiograph, 29 of whom were found to have an actionable lung nodule on prevalence screening. Of the 15 subjects who had a chest CT performed for additional evaluation, a lung nodule was confirmed in 4, 2 of which represented lung cancer. Both of the cancers were seen by the radiologist unaided and were identified by the CAD chest radiograph. The cumulative incidence of symptomatic advanced lung cancer was 0.42 cases per 100 person-years in the control arm; there were no events in the screening arm.; CONCLUSIONS: Further evaluation is necessary to determine if CAD chest radiography has a role as a lung cancer screening tool.

AB PURPOSE: Tumors with oncogenic dependencies on the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) often respond well to targeted inhibition. Our previous work suggested that many cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHNs) depend on autocrine signaling driven by HER2/3 dimerization and high-level co-expression of HRG. Additionally, results from a Phase I trial of MEHD7495A, a dual-action antibody that blocks ligand binding to EGFR and HER3, suggest that high-level HRG expression was associated with clinical response in SCCHN patients. Here we explore the hypothesis that high-level HRG expression defines a subpopulation of SCCHNs with activated HER3.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: qRT-PCR expression profiling was performed on >750 tumors of diverse origin, including >150 therapy-naive, primary, and recurrent SCCHNs. Activated HER3, defined by immunoprecipitation of phospho-HER3, was compared to HRG expression in SCCHN samples. Paracrine versus autocrine expression was evaluated using RNA-in situ hybridization.; RESULTS: SCCHN tumors express the highest levels of HRG compared to a diverse collection of other tumor types. We show that high HRG expression is associated with activated HER3, whereas low HRG expression is associated with low HER3 activation in SCCHN tumors. Furthermore, HRG expression is higher in recurrent SCCHN compared to patient-matched therapy naive specimens.; CONCLUSIONS: HRG expression levels define a biologically distinct subset of SCCHN patients. We propose that high-level expression of HRG is associated with constitutive activation of HER3 in SCCHN and thus defines an actionable biomarker for interventions targeting HER3.

AB There is an urgent need to elicit and validate highly efficacious targets for combinatorial intervention from large scale ongoing molecular characterization efforts of tumors. We established an in silico bioinformatic platform in concert with a high throughput screening platform evaluating 37 novel targeted agents in 669 extensively characterized cancer cell lines reflecting the genomic and tissue-type diversity of human cancers, to systematically identify combinatorial biomarkers of response and co-actionable targets in cancer. Genomic biomarkers discovered in a 141 cell line training set were validated in an independent 359 cell line test set. We identified co-occurring and mutually exclusive genomic events that represent potential drivers and combinatorial targets in cancer. We demonstrate multiple cooperating genomic events that predict sensitivity to drug intervention independent of tumor lineage. The coupling of scalable in silico and biologic high throughput cancer cell line platforms for the identification of co-events in cancer delivers rational combinatorial targets for synthetic lethal approaches with a high potential to pre-empt the emergence of resistance.

AB Recent advances in the ability to efficiently characterize tumor genomes is enabling targeted drug development, which requires rigorous biomarker-based patient selection to increase effectiveness. Consequently, representative DNA biomarkers become equally important in pre-clinical studies. However, it is still unclear how well these markers are maintained between the primary tumor and the patient-derived tumor models. Here, we report the comprehensive identification of somatic coding mutations and copy number aberrations in four glioblastoma (GBM) primary tumors and their matched pre-clinical models: serum-free neurospheres, adherent cell cultures, and mouse xenografts. We developed innovative methods to improve the data quality and allow a strict comparison of matched tumor samples. Our analysis identifies known GBM mutations altering PTEN and TP53 genes, and new actionable mutations such as the loss of PIK3R1, and reveals clear patient-to-patient differences. In contrast, for each patient, we do not observe any significant remodeling of the mutational profile between primary to model tumors and the few discrepancies can be attributed to stochastic errors or differences in sample purity. Similarly, we observe 96% primary-to-model concordance in copy number calls in the high-cellularity samples. In contrast to previous reports based on gene expression profiles, we do not observe significant differences at the DNA level between in vitro compared to in vivo models. This study suggests, at a remarkable resolution, the genome-wide conservation of a patient's tumor genetics in various pre-clinical models, and therefore supports their use for the development and testing of personalized targeted therapies.

AB PURPOSE: To determine whether radiology reports describe clinically significant carotid arterial stenosis in a consistent format that is actionable by ordering clinicians.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective chart review, which included radiology reports of carotid artery imaging for patients hospitalized with ischemic stroke at 127 Veterans Affairs medical centers in 2006-2007. "Clinically significant results" were defined as results with at least 50% stenosis or at least moderate stenosis, excluding complete occlusion. How often clinically significant results were reported as an exact percentage stenosis (such as 60%), range (such as 50%-69%), or category (such as moderate) was determined. Among results reported as a range, how often the range bracketed clinical thresholds of 50% and 70% (typically used to determine appropriateness of carotid arterial revascularization) was determined.; RESULTS: Among 2675 patients, there were 6618 carotid imaging results, of which 1015 (15%) were considered clinically significant. Among 695 clinically significant results at ultrasonography (US), 348 (50%) were described as a range, and another 314 (45%) were reported as an exact percentage stenosis. Among the 348 clinically significant US results reported as a range, 259 (74%) bracketed the thresholds of 50% or 70%. For magnetic resonance angiographic results, 48% (106 of 221) qualitatively described clinically significant results as a category, 38% (84 of 221) as an exact percentage stenosis, and 14% (31 of 221) as a range.; CONCLUSION: In this national health care system, the manner in which clinically significant carotid arterial stenosis was reported varied widely.

AB Web ontology language (OWL), used in combination with the Protege visual interface, is a modern standard for development and maintenance of ontologies and a powerful tool for knowledge presentation. In this work, we describe a novel possibility to use OWL also for the conceptualization of knowledge presented by a set of rules. In this approach, rules are represented as a hierarchy of actionable classes with necessary and sufficient conditions defined by the description logic formalism. The advantages are that: the set of the rules is not an unordered set anymore, the concepts defined in descriptive ontologies can be used directly in the bodies of rules, and Protege presents an intuitive tool for editing the set of rules. Standard ontology reasoning processes are not applicable in this framework, but experiments conducted on the rule sets have demonstrated that the reasoning problems can be successfully solved.

AB BACKGROUND: Qualitative markers of performance are routinely used for medical student assessment, though the extent to which such markers can be readily translated to actionable pieces of information remains uncertain.; PURPOSE: To explore (a) the perceived value to be indicated by descriptor phrases commonly used for describing student performance, (b) the perceived weight of the different performance domains (e.g. communication skills, work ethic, knowledge base, etc), and (c) whether or not the perceived value of the descriptors changes as a function of the performance domains.; METHODS: Five domains of performance were identified from the thematic coding of past medical student transcripts (N = 156). From the transcripts, 91 distinct descriptors indicating the language commonly used by assessors were also identified. From the list of 91 descriptors, Thurstone's method of equal-appearing intervals was used to extract 10 descriptors that were representative of the continuum of student performance. A modified paired comparisons method was then used to enable the relative ranking of each of 10 descriptors combined with each of 5 different domains of performance. A web-based survey was used to collect responses from participants (N = 209), which consisted of medical students and faculty members who were previously involved in student assessment.; RESULTS: Results demonstrated that respondents did not simply sum positive and negative descriptors in a uniform manner. Rather, comments on some domains (e.g., "ability to apply patient centred medicine") were seen as particularly positive when associated with positive descriptors but not particularly negative when associated with negative descriptors. For others (e.g., "receptivity and responsiveness to feedback") the reverse was true. Comments on "knowledge-base" elicited a relatively muted perception at both ends of the scale. Finally, the results also revealed moderate misalignment in the perceptions of assessors and students.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that the use of any given descriptor conveys slightly different meaning dependent on the context in which it is used. This helps to address some key issues surrounding the application of qualitative markers to performance assessment in medical education.

AB Monogenic diseases have a distinctive familial inheritance that follows Mendel's laws, showing patterns like dominant, recessive, or X-linked. There are > 7000 monogenic diseases curated in databases, and together they account for up to 10% of all illnesses encountered in the emergency room or clinic. Despite the rarity of individual monogenic conditions, mapping their causative genes and mutations is important for several reasons. First, knowing the causative gene and mutation could provide actionable information for genetic counselling. Sometimes, knowing the gene and mutation allows for early diagnosis in affected families, which is important if there is an evidence-based intervention. Second, the implication of a mutant gene as being causative for a clinical phenotype provides strong evidence of the importance of the gene product in a cellular or biochemical pathway. Discovery of new molecular pathways in families with rare diseases can serve as the first step toward developing rational therapies to help not only affected families, but also patients with less extreme, nongenetic forms of the same condition. For instance, the study of rare patients with familial hypercholesterolemia helped in developing statin drugs, initially as a treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia but now a widely used therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk.

AB Recent genetic studies in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have identified hundreds of genomic loci harboring risk variants. These variants are shared between diseases at unexpectedly high rates, providing a molecular basis for the shared pathogenesis of immune-mediated disease. If properly used, these results could allow us to identify specific pathways underlying disease; explain disease heterogeneity by grouping patients by molecular causes rather than overall symptomatology; and develop more rational approaches to diagnosis and therapy targeting these molecular defects. Here we review the current state of play in the genetics of immune-mediated disease, evidence for this sharing and how this new knowledge can lead to medically actionable discoveries of pathobiology.

AB Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most prevalent subtype of breast cancer in both early- and advanced-stage disease. Thus, the treatment of HR+ breast cancer has had the greatest global influence in improving clinical outcomes overall. Although the first-line metastatic breast cancer (MBC) trials comparing a third-generation aromatase inhibitor (AI) to tamoxifen have favored the AI, one of the challenges in translating these findings into clinical practice stems from the influence of prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, particularly the increasing use of adjuvant AIs today, on the choice of endocrine agent in the advanced setting because of the development of acquired resistance. Because the majority of patients enrolled into these studies were either endocrine-treatment naive or exposed to tamoxifen only, the "real-life" applicability of the evidence is unclear. Because a superior dose of the selective estrogen receptor (ER) downregulator fulvestrant has now been established, its role as first-line therapy is being re-established. We are now starting to see the promise realized with blocking cross-talking growth factor pathways in addition to the ER pathway. The greatest efficacy is seen with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus in combination with exemestane and, perhaps to a lesser extent, anti-HER2-directed therapy in combination with an AI. Future gains will likely involve a greater understanding of the redundancy and compensation induced by blocking these pathways, trials involving blocking multiple pathways in addition to hormonal agents, and the molecular interrogation of the individual's tumor in search of predictive biomarkers and "actionable" genomic aberrations.

AB Despite increases in the scientific evidence for a variety of medical treatments, a gap remains in the adoption of best medical practices. This manuscript describes a process for adapting published summary guides from comparative effectiveness research to render them concise, targeted to audience, and easily actionable; and a strategy for disseminating such evidence to patients and their physicians through a web-based portal and linked electronic health record. This project adapted summary guides about oral medications for adults with type 2 diabetes to a fifth-grade literacy level and modified the resulting materials based on evaluations with the Suitability Assessment of Materials instrument. Focus groups and individual interviews with patients, diabetes providers, and health literacy experts were employed to evaluate and enhance the adapted summary guide. We present the lessons learned as general guidelines for the creation of concise, targeted, and actionable evidence and its delivery to both patients and providers through increasingly prevalent health information technologies.

AB Trauma signature (TSIG) analysis is an evidence-based method that examines the interrelationship between population exposure to a disaster, extreme event, or complex emergency, and the inter-related physical and psychological consequences for the purpose of providing timely, actionable guidance for effective mental health and psychosocial support that is organically tailored and targeted to the defining features of the event. A series of TSIG case studies has been published since 2011 and TSIG analyses of recent disasters are in process. Disaster Health intends to expedite and feature novel TSIG research focusing on late-breaking disaster events. At the current stage of development, expert consensus is sought for refining the TSIG methodology using a Delphi process. The overarching goal is to create a fully operational system to provide timely guidance for adapting disaster behavioral health support to the salient psychological risk factors in each disaster.

AB The traditional "bench-to-bedside" paradigm for clinical research has been successfully used for many decades. This model of knowledge generation has led to discoveries that have enhanced the quality and length of life. The combination of changes in research practice and in health care delivery, growing complexity in decision-making, increasing use of electronic health records (EHR), and growing resource constraints necessitate a shift to a user-driven research paradigm to generate new knowledge. This conceptual framework was created to clarify the perspective of the decision makers as well as the range of factors and the variability in thresholds used to make decisions. This framework may help researchers in creating actionable information to meet the needs of decision makers, which is needed for the transition to a user-driven research paradigm. Further, it is important to create an appropriate set of incentives to facilitate this transition to a user-driven research paradigm.

AB Health system leaders sometimes adopt quality metrics without robust supporting evidence of improvements in quality and/or quantity of life, which may impair rather than facilitate improved health outcomes. In brief, there is now no easy way to measure how much "health" is conferred by a health system. However, we argue that this goal is achievable. Health-weighted composite quality metrics have the potential to measure "health" by synthesizing individual evidence-based quality metrics into a summary measure, utilizing relative weightings that reflect the relative amount of health benefit conferred by each constituent quality metric. Previously, it has been challenging to create health-weighted composite quality metrics because of methodological and data limitations. However, advances in health information technology and mathematical modeling of disease progression promise to help mitigate these challenges by making patient-level data (eg, from the electronic health record and mobile health (mHealth) more accessible and more actionable for use. Accordingly, it may now be possible to use health information technology to calculate and track a health-weighted composite quality metric for each patient that reflects the health benefit conferred to that patient by the health system. These health-weighted composite quality metrics can be employed for a multitude of important aims that improve health outcomes, including quality evaluation, population health maximization, health disparity attenuation, panel management, resource allocation, and personalization of care. We describe the necessary attributes, the possible uses, and the likely limitations and challenges of health-weighted composite quality metrics using patient-level health data.

AB Background The importance of tackling economic, social and health-related inequities is increasingly accepted as a core concern for the post-Millennium Development Goal framework. However, there is a global dearth of high-quality, policy-relevant and actionable data on inequities within populations, which means that development solutions seldom focus on the people who need them most. INTREC (INDEPTH Training and Research Centres of Excellence) was established with this concern in mind. It aims to provide training for researchers from the INDEPTH network on associations between health inequities, the social determinants of health (SDH), and health outcomes, and on presenting their findings in a usable form to policy makers. Objective As part of a baseline situation analysis for INTREC, this paper assesses the current status of SDH training in three of the African INTREC countries - Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa - as well as the gaps, barriers, and opportunities for training. Methods SDH-related courses from the three countries were identified through personal knowledge of the researchers, supplemented by snowballing and online searches. Interviews were also conducted with, among others, academics engaged in SDH and public health training in order to provide context and complementary material. Information regarding access to the Internet, as a possible INTREC teaching medium, was gathered in each country through online searches. Results SDH-relevant training is available, but 1) the number of places available for students is limited; 2) the training tends to be public-health-oriented rather than inclusive of the broader, multi-sectoral issues associated with SDH; and 3) insufficient funding places limitations on both students and on the training institutions themselves, thereby affecting participation and quality. We also identified rapidly expanding Internet connectivity in all three countries, which opens up opportunities for e-learning on SDH, though the current quality of the Internet services remains mixed. Conclusions SDH training is currently in short supply, and there is a clear role for INTREC to contribute to the training of a critical mass of African researchers on the topic. This work will be accomplished most effectively by building on pre-existing networks, institutions, and methods.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify stakeholder views about national priorities for improvement science and build agreement for action in a national improvement and implementation research network in the USA. This was accomplished using three stages of identification and consensus. (1) Topics were identified through a multipronged environmental scan of the literature and initiatives. (2) Based on this scan, a survey was developed, and stakeholders (n = 2,777) were invited to rate the resulting 33-topic, 9-category list, via an online survey. Data from 560 respondents (20% response) were analyzed. (3) An expert panel used survey results to further refine the research priorities through a Rand Delphi process. Priorities identified were within four categories: care coordination and transitions, high-performing clinical systems and microsystems improvement approaches, implementation of evidence-based improvements and best practices, and culture of quality and safety. The priorities identified were adopted by the improvement science research network as the research agenda to guide strategy. The process and conclusions may be of value to quality improvement research funding agencies, governments, and research units seeking to concentrate their resources on improvement topics where research is capable of yielding timely and actionable answers as well as contributing to the knowledge base for improvement.

AB Decision-making dynamics in pediatric research have their foundation in the principle of the 'best interests of the child'. The introduction of new sequencing technologies and the concomitant debate surrounding the return of research results and incidental findings are, however, challenging the interpretation of this principle. A comparative analysis of international and national approaches to the issue (USA, Canada, France, Spain and the UK) reveals not only the emergence of context-specific pediatric policy in this regard, but one that is 'personalized' to the child - that is, what is clinically significant and actionable during childhood.

AB Genomic predictions of clinical outcome are a core promise of the Human Genome Project. Yet actionable biomarkers in clinical medicine are confounded by patient heterogeneity as patient phenotypes are rarely well characterized and often poorly understood. Furthermore, standard predictive algorithms rely on a priori knowledge of discrete phenotypes for feature selection and training. To address this limitation, we develop a classifier-free algorithm that matches individual patients to other patient outcomes based on optimized clinicopathologic feature integration and molecular pathway similarity using the K-nearest neighbor. By identifying the best matches within the collection of patient data, we are able to return the desired prediction. In prostate cancer, we demonstrate the algorithm's ability to predict cancer recurrence without the need for supervised learning techniques in independent datasets with a recall and precision of 78%. Importantly, the predictor is microarray platform independent, scalable and simple to implement. Taken together, this method provides an exciting foundation from data-driven, clinical decision-making may arise.

AB BACKGROUND: Rhabdoid tumors (also called atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) in the brain), are highly malignant, poor prognosis lesions arising in the kidneys, soft tissues, and central nervous system. Targeted therapy in this disease would benefit from advanced technologies detecting relevant actionable mutations.; PROCEDURE: Here we report on the evaluation of 25 tumors, all with known SMARCB1/INI1 alterations, for the presence of 983 different mutations in 115 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes using OncoMap, a mass spectrometric method of allele detection.; RESULTS: Other than mutations in SMARCB1, our results identified a single activating mutation in NRAS and complete absence of oncogenic mutations in all other genes tested.; CONCLUSION: The absence of mutations in canonical pathways critical for development and progression of adult cancers suggests that distinct mechanisms drive these highly malignant pediatric tumors. This may limit the therapeutic utility of available targeted therapies and require a refocusing toward developmental and epigenetic pathways. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Public health and conflict early warning are evolving rapidly in response to technology changes for the gathering, management, analysis and communication of data. It is expected that these changes will provide an unprecedented ability to monitor, detect, and respond to crises. One of the potentially most profound and lasting expected change affects the roles of the various actors in providing and sharing information and in responding to early warning. Communities and civil society actors have the opportunity to be empowered as a source of information, analysis, and response, while the role of traditional actors shifts toward supporting those communities and building resilience. However, by creating new roles, relationships, and responsibilities, technology changes raise major concerns and ethical challenges for practitioners, pressing the need for practical guidelines and actionable recommendations in line with existing ethical principles.

AB Healthcare is an important social and economic component of modern society, and the effective use of information technology in this industry is critical to its success. As health insurance premiums continue to rise, competitive bidding may be useful in generating stronger price competition and lower premium costs for employers and possibly, government agencies. In this paper, we assess an endeavor by several Fortune 500 companies to reduce healthcare procurement costs for their employees by having HMOs compete in open electronic auctions. Although the auctions were successful in generating significant cost savings for the companies in the first year, i.e., 1999, they failed to replicate the success and were eventually discontinued after two more years. Over the past decade since the failed auction experiment, effective utilization of information technologies have led to significant advances in the design of complex electronic markets. Using this knowledge, and data from the auctions, we point out several shortcomings of the auction design that, we believe, led to the discontinuation of the market after three years. Based on our analysis, we propose several actionable recommendations that policy makers can use to design a sustainable electronic market for procuring health insurance.

AB Globally, health and social inequities are growing and are created, actively maintained, and aggravated by existing policies and practices. The call for evidence-based policy making to address this injustice seems a promising strategy to facilitate a reversal of existing strategies and the design of new effective programming. Acting on evidence to address inequities requires congruence between identifying the major drivers of disparities and the study of their causes and solutions. Yet, current research on inequities tends to focus on documenting disparities among individuals or subpopulations with little focus on identifying the macro-social causes of adverse population health. Moreover, the research base falls far short of a focus on the solutions to the complex multilevel drivers of disparities. This paper focuses upon recommendations to refocus and improve the public health research evidence generated to inform and create strong evidence-based recommendations for improving population health.

AB More than two billion people in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) lack adequate access to essential medicines. In this paper, we make strong public health, human rights and economic arguments for improving access to medicines in LMIC and discuss the different roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, including national governments, the international community, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We then establish a framework of pharmaceutical firms' corporate responsibilities - the "must," the "ought to," and the "can" dimensions - and make recommendations for actionable business strategies for improving access to medicines. We discuss controversial topics, such as pharmaceutical profits and patents, with the goal of building consensus around facts and working towards a solution. We conclude that partnerships and collaboration among multiple stakeholders are urgently needed to improve equitable access to medicines in LMIC.

AB The authors evaluated the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based real-time screening of outpatients for potential defibrillator therapy on practice metrics. Based on ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35% and absence of a defibrillator, the physicians were prompted for an action: electrophysiology consultation, EF evaluation, or "not indicated." Although the number of patients screened remained stable at nearly 6000 per month, consultations and echocardiograms peaked early but returned to a low steady state by 10 months. The number of actual device implants did not increase appreciably as a result of this program. Implementation of a real-time EHR screening algorithm in a busy clinical practice is feasible and generally unobtrusive, without an effect on productivity. Its impact on adherence to guideline-based recommendation is not notable in this case. The number of resulting actionable items declines dramatically and plateaus by 10 months, affording an opportunity to cycle, rather than add, other screening protocols.

AB UNLABELLED: Genetic lesions such as BCR-ABL1, E2A-PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are associated with unfavorable outcomes in adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Leukemia oncoproteins may directly or indirectly disrupt cytosine methylation patterning to mediate the malignant phenotype. We postulated that DNA methylation signatures in these aggressive B-ALLs would point toward disease mechanisms and useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We therefore conducted DNA methylation and gene expression profiling on a cohort of 215 adult patients with B-ALL enrolled in a single phase III clinical trial (ECOG E2993) and normal control B cells. In BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant cytosine methylation patterning centered around a cytokine network defined by hypomethylation and overexpression of IL2RA(CD25). The E2993 trial clinical data showed that CD25 expression was strongly associated with a poor outcome in patients with ALL regardless of BCR-ABL1 status, suggesting CD25 as a novel prognostic biomarker for risk stratification in B-ALLs. In E2A-PBX1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant DNA methylation patterning was strongly associated with direct fusion protein binding as shown by the E2A-PBX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq), suggesting that E2A-PBX1 fusion protein directly remodels the epigenome to impose an aggressive B-ALL phenotype. MLLr B-ALL featured prominent cytosine hypomethylation, which was linked with MLL fusion protein binding, H3K79 dimethylation, and transcriptional upregulation, affecting a set of known and newly identified MLL fusion direct targets with oncogenic activity such as FLT3 and BCL6. Notably, BCL6 blockade or loss of function suppressed proliferation and survival of MLLr leukemia cells, suggesting BCL6-targeted therapy as a new therapeutic strategy for MLLr B-ALLs.; SIGNIFICANCE: We conducted the first integrative epigenomic study in adult B-ALLs, as a correlative study to the ECOG E2993 phase III clinical trial. This study links for the first time the direct actions of oncogenic fusion proteins with disruption of epigenetic regulation mediated by cytosine methylation. We identify a novel clinically actionable biomarker in B-ALLs: IL2RA (CD25), which is linked with BCR-ABL1 and an inflammatory signaling network associated with chemotherapy resistance. We show that BCL6 is a novel MLL fusion protein target that is required to maintain the proliferation and survival of primary human adult MLLr cells and provide the basis for a clinical trial with BCL6 inhibitors for patients with MLLr. ©2012 AACR.

AB This study tested the feasibility of a quality improvement (QI) program that provided first and second year medical students with education in QI processes and demonstrate their utility within the framework of a real-world QI project. Medical students assessed the use of the Surgical Safety Checklist at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Before performing audits students were required to complete a self-paced online program that provided preliminary education in QI, patient safety, leadership, teamwork, and patient-centered care. A 2.5-hr orientation introduced basic operating room protocol, and the surgical checklist audit tool. Orientation included a multimedia simulation of checklist usage and a role-playing exercise simulating its use. Students completed pre- and postparticipation assessments. Results included an increased knowledge of QI methodology, an improved understanding of the evidence supporting the need for QI projects within health systems, and a greater awareness of available QI projects. Students' perspectives changed to indicate an increased belief that QI is the responsibility of all health professionals including physicians, administrators and other staff. This study concluded that QI education can be effectively disseminated to medical students early in their education using existing online tools and experiential QI projects, and can result in actionable QI data supporting hospital improvement initiatives. © 2012 National Association for Healthcare Quality.

AB This study was conducted to assess the current pattern of use and the impact of available molecular predictive and prognostic biomarkers on clinical care in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). An online questionnaire consisting of 15 questions about the frequency of use and clinical utility of tissue-based molecular tests was distributed to 1,053 members of the Neuro-Oncology Community in the United States. A total of 320 responses (30.4 %) were collected. 73 respondents who did not see GBM patients were excluded from analysis. MGMT promoter methylation testing (MGMT-meth) was the most commonly requested (37.2; 95 % CI, 31-44), followed by EGFR amplification (22.7; 95 % CI, 18-28), co-deletion of 1p/19q (22.3 %), EGFR expression (21.5 %), P53 mutation (19.8 %), PTEN mutation or deletion (17.4 %), EGFRvIII mutation (12.1 %), IDH1/2 mutation (12.1 %), PDGFR (4.5 %), and PIK3CA (0.8 %). The perceived utility of these studies was variable between participants. A small percentage of respondents felt that any of the studies were "always" or "almost always" helpful in clinical decision making (MGMT-meth 10.9 %; range, 0-13.8 %), but more frequently "never" or "almost never" helpful (MGMT-meth 25.9 %; range, 25-54.7 %). 26.7 % reported not to routinely order any of these studies. Although molecular markers are frequently ordered for patients with GBM, only a minority of clinicians ordering these tests report that the results influence clinical decision-making. Molecular markers that are likely to affect patient care should be ordered with the goal to maximize benefit for patients and to avoid non-actionable results and additional costs.

AB The conduct of clinical and translational research regularly involves the use of a variety of heterogeneous and large-scale data resources. Scalable methods for the integrative analysis of such resources, particularly when attempting to leverage computable domain knowledge in order to generate actionable hypotheses in a high-throughput manner, remain an open area of research. In this report, we describe both a generalizable design pattern for such integrative knowledge-anchored hypothesis discovery operations and our experience in applying that design pattern in the experimental context of a set of driving research questions related to the publicly available Osteoarthritis Initiative data repository. We believe that this 'test bed' project and the lessons learned during its execution are both generalizable and representative of common clinical and translational research paradigms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that chromosomal microarray analysis frequently diagnoses conditions that require specific medical follow-up and that referring physicians respond appropriately to abnormal test results.; METHODS: A total of 46,298 postnatal patients were tested by chromosomal microarray analysis for a variety of indications, most commonly intellectual disability/developmental delay, congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, and neurobehavioral problems. The frequency of detection of abnormalities associated with actionable clinical features was tallied, and the rate of physician response to a subset of abnormal tests results was monitored.; RESULTS: A total of 2088 diagnoses were made of more than 100 different disorders that have specific clinical features that warrant follow-up. The detection rate for these conditions using high-resolution whole-genome microarrays was 5.4%, which translates to 35% of all clinically significant abnormal test results identified in our laboratory. In a subset of cases monitored for physician response, appropriate clinical action was taken more than 90% of the time as a direct result of the microarray finding.; CONCLUSIONS: The disorders diagnosed by chromosomal microarray analysis frequently have clinical features that need medical attention, and physicians respond to the diagnoses with specific clinical actions, thus arguing that microarray testing provides clinical utility for a significant number of patients tested.

AB The Knowledge Network (www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk) is Scotland's online knowledge service for health and social care. It is designed to support practitioners to apply knowledge in frontline delivery of care, helping to translate knowledge into better health-care outcomes through safe, effective, person-centred care. The Knowledge Network helps to combine the worlds of evidence-based practice and quality improvement by providing access to knowledge about the effectiveness of clinical interventions ('know-what') and knowledge about how to implement this knowledge to support individual patients in working health-care environments ('know-how'). An 'evidence and guidance' search enables clinicians to quickly access quality-assured evidence and best practice, while point of care and mobile solutions provide knowledge in actionable formats to embed in clinical workflow. This research-based knowledge is complemented by social networking services and improvement tools which support the capture and exchange of knowledge from experience, facilitating practice change and systems improvement. In these cases, the Knowledge Network supports key components of the knowledge-to-action cycle--acquiring, creating, sharing and disseminating knowledge to improve performance and innovate. It provides a vehicle for implementing the recommendations of the national Knowledge into Action review, which outlines a new national approach to embedding knowledge in frontline practice and systems improvement.

AB Direct to consumer (DTC) genomic services facilitate the personalized and participatory aspects of "P4" medicine, but raise questions regarding use of genomic data in providing predictive and preventive healthcare. We illustrate the issues involved by describing a pregnancy management case in which a treatment plan was modified based on a DTC result. A woman whose personal and family history were otherwise unremarkable for thromboembolism learned through DTC testing about the presence of a prothrombin (factor 2) gene mutation (rs1799963). Twice daily injections of enoxaparin were recommended throughout pregnancy for this patient who, without prior knowledge of this mutation, would not have been offered such therapy. Moreover, genetically based medical guidelines are a moving target, and treatment of thrombophilic conditions in asymptomatic patients is controversial. We address the state of the art in actionable personalized medicine with respect to clotting disorders in pregnancy, as well as other factors at play- economics, patient preference, and clinical decision support. We also discuss what steps are needed to increase the utility of genomic data in personalized medicine by collecting information and converting it into actionable knowledge.

AB Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. The prognosis of SCLC patients is devastating and no biologically targeted therapeutics are active in this tumor type. To develop a framework for development of specific SCLC-targeted drugs we conducted a combined genomic and pharmacological vulnerability screen in SCLC cell lines. We show that SCLC cell lines capture the genomic landscape of primary SCLC tumors and provide genetic predictors for activity of clinically relevant inhibitors by screening 267 compounds across 44 of these cell lines. We show Aurora kinase inhibitors are effective in SCLC cell lines bearing MYC amplification, which occur in 3-7% of SCLC patients. In MYC-amplified SCLC cells Aurora kinase inhibition associates with G2/M-arrest, inactivation of PI3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, and induction of apoptosis. Aurora dependency in SCLC primarily involved Aurora B, required its kinase activity, and was independent of depletion of cytoplasmic levels of MYC. Our study suggests that a fraction of SCLC patients may benefit from therapeutic inhibition of Aurora B. Thus, thorough chemical and genomic exploration of SCLC cell lines may provide starting points for further development of rational targeted therapeutic intervention in this deadly tumor type.

AB INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a syndromic illness that has traditionally been defined by a set of broad, highly sensitive clinical parameters. As a result, numerous distinct pathophysiologic states may meet diagnostic criteria for sepsis, leading to syndrome heterogeneity. The existence of biologically distinct sepsis subtypes may in part explain the lack of actionable evidence from clinical trials of sepsis therapies. We used microarray-based gene expression data from adult patients with sepsis in order to identify molecularly distinct sepsis subtypes.; METHODS: We used partitioning around medoids (PAM) and hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles from neutrophils taken from a cohort of septic patients in order to identify distinct subtypes. Using the medoids learned from this cohort, we then clustered a second independent cohort of septic patients, and used the resulting class labels to evaluate differences in clinical parameters, as well as the expression of relevant pharmacogenes.; RESULTS: We identified two sepsis subtypes based on gene expression patterns. Subtype 1 was characterized by increased expression of genes involved in inflammatory and Toll receptor mediated signaling pathways, as well as a higher prevalence of severe sepsis. There were differences between subtypes in the expression of pharmacogenes related to hydrocortisone, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and drotrecogin alpha.; CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis subtypes can be identified based on different gene expression patterns. These patterns may generate hypotheses about the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis and suggest new ways of classifying septic patients both in clinical practice, and in the design of clinical trials.

AB The revolution in disease diagnosis and treatment promised on the completion of the human genome project over a decade ago has materialized in the form of unified drug and biomarker discovery and development pipelines. This strategic shift has been principally catalyzed through success stories in the field of oncology, ushering in the era of personalized medicine. Thus, a number of molecular targets have also been demonstrated to be reliable markers for selecting patients wherein treatment can be efficacious. Perhaps more importantly, however, the late adoption of biomarker strategies has also rescued drug candidates from complete late-stage failure. This review examines the historical lessons of key challenges in translating biomarker assay information into strategic and clinically actionable decisions and assesses the impact of personalized genome sequencing in the future of companion diagnostic development and commercialization.

AB Recent technologic advances have permitted higher resolution and more rapid analysis of individual cancer genomes at the single-nucleotide level. Such advances have shown bewildering intertumor heterogeneity with limited somatic alterations shared between tumors of the same histopathologic subtype. Exacerbating such complexity, increasing evidence of intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITH) is emerging, both within individual tumor biopsies and spatially separated between biopsies of the same tumor. Sequential analysis of tumors has also revealed evidence that ITH temporally evolves during the disease course. ITH has implications for predictive or prognostic biomarker strategies, where the tumor subclone that may ultimately influence therapeutic outcome may evade detection because of its absence or presence at low frequency at diagnosis or because of its regional separation from the tumor biopsy site. In this review, the implications of "trunk and branch" tumor evolution for drug discovery approaches and emerging evidence that low-frequency somatic events may drive tumor growth through paracrine signaling fostering a tumor ecologic niche are discussed. The concept of an "actionable mutation" is considered within a model of clonal dominance and heterogeneous tumor cell dependencies. Evidence that cancer therapeutics may augment ITH and the need to track the tumor subclonal architecture through treatment are defined as key research areas. Finally, if combination therapeutic approaches to limit the consequences of ITH prove challenging, identification of drivers or suppressors of ITH may provide attractive therapeutic targets to limit tumor evolutionary rates and adaptation. ©2012 AACR.

AB The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) is a resource that collects, curates, and disseminates information about the impact of human genetic variation on drug responses. It provides clinically relevant information, including dosing guidelines, annotated drug labels, and potentially actionable gene-drug associations and genotype-phenotype relationships. Curators assign levels of evidence to variant-drug associations using well-defined criteria based on careful literature review. Thus, PharmGKB is a useful source of high-quality information supporting personalized medicine-implementation projects.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize the performance of glucose meter test strips using simulated dynamic temperature and humidity disaster conditions.; METHODS: Glucose oxidase- and glucose dehydrogenase-based test strips were dynamically stressed for up to 680 hours using an environmental chamber to simulate conditions during Hurricane Katrina. Paired measurements vs control were obtained using 3 aqueous reagent levels for GMS1 and 2 for GMS2.; RESULTS: Stress affected the performance of GMS1 at level 1 (P < .01); and GMS2 at both levels (P < .001), lowering GMS1 results but elevating GMS2 results. Glucose median-paired differences were elevated at both levels on GMS2 after 72 hours. Median-paired differences (stress minus control) were as much as -10 mg/dL (range, -65 to 33) at level 3 with GMS1, with errors as large as 21.9%. Glucose median-paired differences were as high as 5 mg/dL (range, -1 to 10) for level 1 on GMS2, with absolute errors up to 24.4%.; CONCLUSIONS: The duration of dynamic stress affected the performance of both GMS1 and GMS2 glucose test strips. Therefore, proper monitoring, handling, and storage of point-of-care (POC) reagents are needed to ensure their integrity and quality of actionable results, thereby minimizing treatment errors in emergency and disaster settings.

AB Breast cancer includes high number of molecular entities targetable by specific agents. In this study, array CGH and PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were used to drive patients into targeted therapy. A prospective molecular analysis was offered to metastatic breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively or retrospectively either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue. Analyses were performed using array CGH (Agilent platform) and PIK3CA (exon 10 and 21) and AKT1 mutations were explored by standard Sanger sequencing. One hundred and eight patients were included. Good quality CGH was obtained in 79% cases and was better for frozen samples. Genomic alterations were identified in 50% of patients including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations. Eighteen treatments (17 patients) were administered according to their molecular profile with evidence of activity in nine. Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment included absence of progressive disease (38%), investigator's choice (9%), rapid PD (19%), and no drug access (21%). Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97% cases; failures were related to low % of tumour cells. Our study showed that array CGH is feasible in the context of daily practice and, in combination with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations, identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations that allow driving patients into specific targeted agents.

AB Because radiology has historically not measured its added value to patient care and thus not communicated it in easily understood terms to all stakeholders, the specialty must correct this to prepare for the eventual transition from the current fee-for-service payment schedule to new value-based reimbursement systems. Given the increasing risk for marginalization, radiologists need to engage clinicians and managers to map the processes and associated costs of episodes of patient care to identify areas for providing and improving integrated diagnostic information and to measure the value thereof. In such time-driven, activity-based costing practices, radiologists should highlight how proper investments in the information generated by imaging and how radiologists' associated consultative and coordination of services can save greater resources downstream, especially in the nonrenewable resource of physician time, an increasingly scarce health care resource. Using physician time in the most efficient way will be a key element for decreasing health care costs at the aggregate level. Therefore, expressing radiology's contribution in terms of downstream physician time saved is a metric that can be easily understood by all stakeholders. In a conceptual framework centered on value, the specialty of radiology must focus more on its most important product, actionable information, rather than on imaging technologies themselves. Information, unlike imaging technologies, does not depreciate with time but rather increases in value the more it is used. Copyright © 2012 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Scholars in diverse health-related disciplines and specialty fields of practice routinely promote qualitative research as an essential component of intervention and implementation programs of research and of a comprehensive evidence base for practice. Remarkably little attention, however, has been paid to the most important element of qualitative studies--the findings in reports of those studies--and specifically to enhancing the accessibility and utilization value of these findings for diverse audiences of users. The findings in reports of qualitative health research are too often difficult to understand and even to find owing to the way they are presented. A basic strategy for enhancing the presentation of these findings is to translate them into thematic statements, which can then in turn be translated into the language of intervention and implementation. Writers of qualitative health research reports might consider these strategies better to showcase the significance and actionability of findings to a wider audience.

AB Rising health care costs will result in reduced payments to providers, but across-the-board provider payment reductions are not the answer. Instead, existing payment systems should be reformed to strengthen value for the dollars spent. This can be accomplished by increasing efficiency, improving quality and outcomes, and lowering costs. Payment system reforms must be practical, transparent, identify opportunities for care improvement, and demonstrate material cost savings. Most importantly, because the current growth in health care costs is unsustainable, these reforms must be able to be implemented today. A set of comprehensive measures is being used by state government and private payers in the United States to adjust payment, based on improved outcomes quality. This article details the use of this set of measures, referred to as potentially preventable events, and demonstrates how they are being applied to achieve health care value.

AB BACKGROUND: Key challenges in benchmarking health service achievement of policy goals in areas such as chronic disease are: 1) developing indicators and understanding how policy goals might work as indicators of service performance; 2) developing methods for economically collecting and reporting stakeholder perceptions; 3) combining and sharing data about the performance of organizations; 4) interpreting outcome measures; 5) obtaining actionable benchmarking information. This study aimed to explore how a new Boolean-based small-N method from the social sciences-Qualitative Comparative Analysis or QCA-could contribute to meeting these internationally shared challenges.; METHODS: A 'multi-value QCA' (MVQCA) analysis was conducted of data from 24 senior staff at 17 randomly selected services for chronic disease, who provided perceptions of 1) whether government health services were improving their achievement of a set of statewide policy goals for chronic disease and 2) the efficacy of state health office actions in influencing this improvement. The analysis produced summaries of configurations of perceived service improvements.; RESULTS: Most respondents observed improvements in most areas but uniformly good improvements across services were not perceived as happening (regardless of whether respondents identified a state health office contribution to that improvement). The sentinel policy goal of using evidence to develop service practice was not achieved at all in four services and appears to be reliant on other kinds of service improvements happening.; CONCLUSIONS: The QCA method suggested theoretically plausible findings and an approach that with further development could help meet the five benchmarking challenges. In particular, it suggests that achievement of one policy goal may be reliant on achievement of another goal in complex ways that the literature has not yet fully accommodated but which could help prioritize policy goals. The weaknesses of QCA can be found wherever traditional big-N statistical methods are needed and possible, and in its more complex and therefore difficult to empirically validate findings. It should be considered a potentially valuable adjunct method for benchmarking complex health policy goals such as those for chronic disease.

AB Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires assess topics a patient can report about his or her own health. This includes symptoms (eg, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, pain, or frequent urination), physical functioning (eg, difficulty climbing stairs or difficulty fastening buttons), and mental health (eg, anxiety, fear, or worry). Electronic PRO (ePRO) systems are used in oncology clinical care because of 1) their ability to enhance clinical care by flagging important symptoms and saving clinicians time; 2) the availability of standardized methods for creating and implementing PROs in clinics; and 3) the existence of user-friendly platforms for patient self-reporting like tablet computers and automated telephone surveys. Many ePRO systems can provide actionable links to clinical care such as summary reports in a patient's electronic medical record and real-time e-mail alerts to providers when patients report acute needs. This review presents 5 examples of ePRO systems currently in use in oncology practice. These systems support multiple clinical activities, including assessment of symptoms and toxicities related to chemotherapy and radiation, postoperative surveillance, and symptom management during palliative care and hospice. Patient self-reporting is possible both at clinical visits and between visits over the Internet or by telephone. The implementation of an ePRO system requires significant resources and expertise, as well as user training. ePRO systems enable regular monitoring of patient symptoms, function, and needs, and can enhance the efficiency and quality of care as well as communication with patients.

AB Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable, B-cell malignancy characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow. Despite recent advances in the understanding of genomic aberrations, a comprehensive catalogue of clinically actionable mutations in MM is just beginning to emerge. The tyrosine kinase (TK) and RAS oncogenes, which encode important regulators of various signaling pathways, are among the most frequently altered gene families in cancer. To clarify the role of TK and RAS genes in the pathogenesis of MM, we performed a systematic, targeted screening of mutations on prioritized RAS and TK genes, in CD138-sorted bone marrow specimens from 42 untreated patients. We identified a total of 24 mutations in the KRAS, PIK3CA, INSR, LTK, and MERTK genes. In particular, seven novel mutations in addition to known KRAS mutations were observed. Prediction analysis tools PolyPhen and Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) were used to assess the functional significance of these novel mutations. Our analysis predicted that these mutations may have a deleterious effect, resulting in the functional alteration of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of myeloma. While further investigation is needed to determine the functional consequences of these proteins, mutational testing of the RAS and TK genes in larger myeloma cohorts might also be useful to establish the recurrent nature of these mutations.

AB Given the continued proliferation of public/ private partnerships as vehicles for sharing best practices, lessons learned and actionable information, the keys to their success become more important to identify. Effective partnerships enhance the resilience of their respective members, which, in turn, improves community resilience. Thus, identifying the attributes of a successful partnership should be a high priority for those looking to foster collaboration between the public and private sectors. This paper will illustrate with two case studies how successful partnerships creatively leverage opportunities and manage the evolution of public/private relationships, while always seeking to institutionalise these collaborative efforts. The first will discuss briefly the development of the most important national partnership within the financial sector. The other focuses on a public/private task force in Chicago, composed of public safety agencies and representatives of critical infrastructure, which owes its existence to an unexpected research project and that needed to be restructured in light of experience. The manner in which the task force formed and evolved yields many lessons for partnerships interested in remaining relevant and effective.

AB PURPOSE: In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer after breast and prostate cancer. Numerous improvement programs have been implemented to increase CRC screening rates, but few have focused on improving the care and management of patients with a diagnosis of this malignancy. As national medical organizations focus on quality of care, efforts are necessary to provide clinicians the opportunity for self-assessment and methods for practice improvement. With this goal in mind, a national continuing medical education-certified performance improvement initiative was conceived.; METHODS: THE INITIATIVE CONSISTED OF THREE STAGES: First, participants self-assessed their performance of predetermined topic measures through a review of patient charts. The topic areas included patient safety and supportive care, evidence-based surveillance, and evidenced-based treatment and were derived from current guidelines and other successful quality-improvement initiatives. Second, an actionable plan for practice improvement was developed in at least one of the three topic areas. Third, after a period of self-improvement, participants reassessed their performance of the same topic measures to determine tangible changes in patient care.; RESULTS: A total of 540 patient charts were reviewed by 27 clinicians. Notable results showed large gains in areas of supportive care, such as quantitative pain assessments and emotional well-being evaluations, which traditionally have been a minor focus of other quality-improvement initiatives. Participants also showed tangible improvements in the performance of leading measures of quality care.; CONCLUSION: These findings support the need for continued efforts toward performance improvement in both established and emerging areas of CRC patient care.

AB BACKGROUND: Empiric steroid therapy is the first-line therapy for pediatric nephrotic syndrome, but treatment response is variable. There are few predictors of steroid-responsiveness, although evidence for genetic factors does exist. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been recently identified in the promoter region of glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1) which affect steroid-responsiveness in asthmatic patients. Independently, GLCCI1 was identified as a podocyte protein, the loss of which disrupts the function of the glomerular filtration barrier. We therefore examined whether SNPs associated with the steroid-responsive expression of GLCCI1 might predict steroid-responsiveness in nephrotic syndrome.; CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A cohort of 211 pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome and 102 controls were genotyped; among the cases, 117 were initial steroid responders, while 94 did not respond to oral steroids. No statistically significant differences were noted among the groups, although there was a trend based on the comparison of the small subgroups of steroid-responsive and non-responsive patients with biopsy-proven minimal change disease.; CONCLUSIONS: While larger cohorts are needed to ascertain the possibility of a small effect of GLCCI1 SNPs on the steroid-responsiveness of nephrotic syndrome, the GLCCI1 SNPs associated with steroid-responsiveness in asthmatic patients are unlikely to have a clinically actionable impact in pediatric nephrotic syndrome.

AB INTRODUCTION: Inappropriate opioid medication utilization has grown tremendously in recent years. Managed care organizations have the opportunity to identify potential opioid misuse and implement care coordination interventions.; METHODS: This randomized controlled study evaluated the impact of providing actionable information to prescribers of members who received opioid prescriptions from 3 or more prescribers at 3 or more pharmacies in a 3-month identification period. Impact was assessed through change in number of prescribers, dispensing pharmacies, and filled opioid prescriptions over a 1-year period following identification.; RESULTS: Members randomly assigned to the intervention group demonstrated greater reductions in the number of prescribers (23.98%), dispensing pharmacies (16.28%), and filled opioid prescriptions (15.25%) over the 1-year period. Regression analyses identified group assignment and the number of opioid prescribers in the 3-month identification period as statistically significant predictors of reductions in the number of prescribers, pharmacies, and filled prescriptions.; CONCLUSIONS: This intervention provided action-able information to prescribers regarding member opioid utilization, in addition to available managed care resources. It resulted in significantly greater reductions in the number of prescribers, pharmacies, and prescriptions compared with a general information letter notifying prescribers of available managed care resources. Implementation of this intervention has the potential to enhance coordination of care for members potentially at risk for poor health outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of progression from latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to active tuberculosis are needed. We assessed correlations between infection outcome and antibody responses in macaques and humans by high-throughput, proteome-scale serological studies.; METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome microarrays were probed with serial sera from macaques representing various infection outcomes and with single-point human sera from tuberculosis suspects. Fluorescence intensity data were analyzed by calculating Z scores and associated P values. Temporal changes in macaque antibody responses were analyzed by polynomial regression. Correlations between human responses and sputum bacillary burden were assessed by quantile and hurdle regression.; RESULTS: Macaque outcome groups exhibited distinct antibody profiles: early, transient responses in latent infection and stable antibody increase in active and reactivation disease. In humans, antibody levels and reactive protein numbers increased with bacillary burden. Responses to a subset of 10 proteins were more tightly associated with disease state than reactivity to the broader reactive proteome.; CONCLUSIONS: Integration of macaque and human data reveals dynamic properties of antibody responses in relation to outcome and leads to actionable findings for translational research. These include the potential of antibody responses to detect acute infection and preclinical tuberculosis and to identify serodiagnostic proteins for the spectrum of bacillary burden in tuberculosis.

AB BACKGROUND: The impact of vertical programs on health systems is a much-debated topic, and more evidence on this complex relationship is needed. This article describes a research protocol developed to assess the relationship between the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, routine immunization, and primary health care in multiple settings.; METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol was designed as a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods, making use of comparative ethnographies. The study evaluates the impact of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative on routine immunization and primary health care by: (a) combining quantitative and qualitative work into one coherent study design; (b) using purposively selected qualitative case studies to systematically evaluate the impact of key contextual variables; and (c) making extensive use of the method of participant observation to create comparative ethnographies of the impact of a single vertical program administered in varied contexts.; DISCUSSION: The study design has four major benefits: (1) the careful selection of a range of qualitative case studies allowed for systematic comparison; (2) the use of participant observation yielded important insights on how policy is put into practice; (3) results from our quantitative analysis could be explained by results from qualitative work; and (4) this research protocol can inform the creation of actionable recommendations. Here, recommendations for how to overcome potential challenges in carrying out such research are presented. This study illustrates the utility of mixed-methods research designs in which qualitative data are not just used to embellish quantitative results, but are an integral component of the analysis.

AB Polluting facilities and hazardous sites are often concentrated in low-income communities of color already facing additional stressors to their health. The influence of socioeconomic status is not considered in traditional models of risk assessment. We describe a pilot study of a screening method that considers both pollution burden and population characteristics in assessing the potential for cumulative impacts. The goal is to identify communities that warrant further attention and to thereby provide actionable guidance to decision- and policy-makers in achieving environmental justice. The method uses indicators related to five components to develop a relative cumulative impact score for use in comparing communities: exposures, public health effects, environmental effects, sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors. Here, we describe several methodological considerations in combining disparate data sources and report on the results of sensitivity analyses meant to guide future improvements in cumulative impact assessments. We discuss criteria for the selection of appropriate indicators, correlations between them, and consider data quality and the influence of choices regarding model structure. We conclude that the results of this model are largely robust to changes in model structure.

AB The Gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of nosocomial infections, primarily among immunocompromised patients. The emergence of strains resistant to carbapenems has left few treatment options, making infection containment critical. In 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center experienced an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae that affected 18 patients, 11 of whom died. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on K. pneumoniae isolates to gain insight into why the outbreak progressed despite early implementation of infection control procedures. Integrated genomic and epidemiological analysis traced the outbreak to three independent transmissions from a single patient who was discharged 3 weeks before the next case became clinically apparent. Additional genomic comparisons provided evidence for unexpected transmission routes, with subsequent mining of epidemiological data pointing to possible explanations for these transmissions. Our analysis demonstrates that integration of genomic and epidemiological data can yield actionable insights and facilitate the control of nosocomial transmission.

AB This study used an event-based approach to understand condom use in a probability sample of 309 homeless youth recruited from service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Condom use was significantly less likely when hard drug use preceded sex, the relationship was serious, the partners talked about "pulling out", or sex occurred in a non-private place (and marginally less likely when heavier drinking preceded sex, or the partnership was monogamous or abusive). Condom use was significantly more likely when the youth held positive condom attitudes or were concerned about pregnancy, the partners talked about condom use, and the partners met up by chance. This study extends previous work by simultaneously examining a broad range of individual, relationship, and contexual factors that may play a role in condom use. Results identify a number of actionable targets for programs aimed at reducing HIV/STI transmission and pregnancy risk among homeless youth.

AB OBJECTIVES: We set out to create a psychosocial oncology care framework and a set of relevant recommendations that can be used to improve the quality of comprehensive cancer care for Ontario patients and their families.meet the psychosocial health care needs of cancer patients and their families at both the provider and system levels.; DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: The adapte process and the practice guideline development cycle were used to adapt the 10 recommendations from the 2008 U.S. Institute of Medicine standard Cancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs into the psychosocial oncology care framework. In addition, the evidence contained in the original document was used, in combination with the expertise of the working group, to create a set of actionable recommendations. Refinement after formal external review was conducted.; DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The new framework consists of 8 defining domains. Of those 8 domains, 7 were adapted from recommendations in the source document; 1 new domain, to raise awareness about the need for psychosocial support of cancer patients and their families, was added. To ensure high-quality psychosocial care and services, 31 actionable recommendations were created. The document was submitted to an external review process. More than 70% of practitioners rated the quality of the advice document as high and reported that they would recommend its use.; CONCLUSIONS: This advice document advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care in response to the distress experienced by cancer patients and their families. The recommendations will be useful in future to measure performance, quality of practice, and access to psychosocial services.

AB Developmental delay (delay) and co-morbidities like autism are common in children with epilepsy. We assessed the yield of routine screening for delay and autism in a hospital-based program. Parents completed developmental and autism screeners for 65 children (average age=2.5y; 38(58%) boys). Forty-nine (75%) were established epilepsy patients, and 16 (25%) were new patients. For development, 47 (72%) children screened positive and 8 (12%) had borderline results. Twenty-four (37%) scored positive for autism, all of whom also screened positive for developmental delay. Delays and neurologic deficits accounted for the positive autism results in 20 of the 24. Developmental findings were confirmatory (already receiving services) in 32/55 (58%) children and actionable in 17 (31%) (requiring further evaluation). Referrals for further evaluations were made for most with actionable findings. The yield of routine screening of children in a tertiary center is sufficiently high to support its use and to consider screening of all children seen with epilepsy. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Many perspectives on the role of evolution in human health include nonempirical assumptions concerning the adaptive evolutionary origins of human diseases. Evolutionary analyses of the increasing wealth of clinical and population genomic data have begun to challenge these presumptions. In order to systematically evaluate such claims, the time has come to build a common framework for an empirical and intellectual unification of evolution and modern medicine. We review the emerging evidence and provide a supporting conceptual framework that establishes the classical neutral theory of molecular evolution (NTME) as the basis for evaluating disease- associated genomic variations in health and medicine. For over a decade, the NTME has already explained the origins and distribution of variants implicated in diseases and has illuminated the power of evolutionary thinking in genomic medicine. We suggest that a majority of disease variants in modern populations will have neutral evolutionary origins (previously neutral), with a relatively smaller fraction exhibiting adaptive evolutionary origins (previously adaptive). This pattern is expected to hold true for common as well as rare disease variants. Ultimately, a neutral evolutionary perspective will provide medicine with an informative and actionable framework that enables objective clinical assessment beyond convenient tendencies to invoke past adaptive events in human history as a root cause of human disease.

AB The development and application of systems strategies to biology and disease are transforming medical research and clinical practice in an unprecedented rate. In the foreseeable future, clinicians, medical researchers, and ultimately the consumers and patients will be increasingly equipped with a deluge of personal health information, e.g., whole genome sequences, molecular profiling of diseased tissues, and periodic multi-analyte blood testing of biomarker panels for disease and wellness. The convergence of these practices will enable accurate prediction of disease susceptibility and early diagnosis for actionable preventive schema and personalized treatment regimes tailored to each individual. It will also entail proactive participation from all major stakeholders in the health care system. We are at the dawn of predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory (P4) medicine, the fully implementation of which requires marrying basic and clinical researches through advanced systems thinking and the employment of high-throughput technologies in genomics, proteomics, nanofluidics, single-cell analysis, and computation strategies in a highly-orchestrated discipline we termed translational systems medicine.

AB Men who have sex with men (MSM) have unique health-care needs, not only because of biological factors such as an increased susceptibility to infection with HIV and sexually transmitted infections associated with their sexual behaviour, but also because of internalisation of societal stigma related to homosexuality and gender non-conformity, resulting in depression, anxiety, substance use, and other adverse outcomes. Successful responses to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic will require the development of culturally sensitive clinical care programmes for MSM that address these health disparities and root causes of maladaptive behaviour (eg, societal homophobia). Health-care providers need to become familiar with local outreach agencies, hotlines, and media that can connect MSM with positive role models and social opportunities. Research is needed to understand how many MSM lead resilient and productive lives in the face of discrimination to develop assets-based interventions that build on community support. Optimum clinical care for sexual and gender minorities is a fundamental human right. MSM deserve to be treated with respect, and health-care providers need to interact with them in ways that promote disclosure of actionable health information. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: We have developed a framework for translating existing sources of synthesized and quality-assessed evidence, primarily systematic reviews, into actionable messages in the form of short accessible briefings. The service aims to address real-life problems in response to requests from decision-makers.Development of the framework was based on a scoping review of existing resources and our initial experience with two briefing topics, including models of service provision for young people with eating disorders. We also drew on previous experience in dissemination research and practice. Where appropriate, we made use of the SUPporting POlicy relevant Reviews and Trials (SUPPORT) tools for evidence-informed policymaking.; FINDINGS: To produce a product that it is fit for this purpose it has been necessary to go beyond a traditional summary of the available evidence relating to effectiveness. Briefings have, therefore, included consideration of cost effectiveness, local applicability, implications relating to local service delivery, budgets, implementation and equity. Our first evidence briefings produced under this framework cover diagnostic endoscopy by specialist nurses and integrated care pathways in mental healthcare settings.; CONCLUSIONS: The framework will enable researchers to present and contextualize evidence from systematic reviews and other sources of synthesized and quality-assessed evidence. The approach is designed to address the wide range of questions of interest to decision-makers, especially those commissioning services or managing service delivery and organization in primary or secondary care. Evaluation of the use and usefulness of the evidence briefings we produce is an integral part of the framework and will help to fill a gap in the literature.

AB The literature highlights that disparities in health care performance exist. Publicly reporting data about disparities at an actionable level is needed. The Minnesota Health Care Disparities Report is designed to publicly report medical group health care performance rates for patients enrolled in state/federally funded programs. In addition, differences between patients enrolled in state-funded public programs and those in private or Medicare programs at statewide and medical group levels are presented. The endeavor is a cooperative one between Minnesota Community Measurement, an independent nonprofit community organization, and the Minnesota Department of Human Services, the state Medicaid agency. Public reporting makes transparent the gaps in the delivery of health care between patients enrolled in these programs at a medical group level and can facilitate quality improvement locally, where accountability lies and actions to address disparities can occur.

AB BACKGROUND: While most faculty members want to improve as teachers, they neither know where their educational strengths and weaknesses lie nor where or how to begin to effect a change in their teaching abilities. The lack of actionable, directed and specific feedback, and sensible and sensitive metrics to assess performance and improvement complicates the attainment of educational excellence.; PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to outline a series of specific steps that medical education programs can take to enhance the quality of teaching, promote teaching excellence, elevate the status and value of medical educators, and stimulate the creation of innovative teaching programs and curricula.; METHODS: To achieve these goals at the Hospital for Special Surgery, the Academy of Rheumatology Medical Educators was formed. The academy had the following goals: (1) create within our institution a mission which advances and supports educators, (2) establish a membership composed of distinguished educators, (3) create a formal organizational structure with designated leadership, (4) dedicate resources that fund mission-related initiatives and research, and (5) establish a plan for promoting teachers as well as enhancing and advancing educational scholarship.; RESULTS: The Hospital for Special Surgery Academy of Rheumatology Medical Educators was recently formed to address these goals by promoting teaching and learning of musculoskeletal skills in an environment that is supportive to educators and trainees and provides much needed resources for teachers.; SUMMARY: The development of a pilot academy of medical educators represents one of the high-priority goals of those institutions that wish to elevate and enrich their teaching through a structured, proven approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hospice and palliative care providers need ways to measure and improve care processes. We tested feasibility, usability, reliability, and validity of Prepare, Embrace, Attend, Communicate, Empower (PEACE) quality measures for palliative care.; METHODS: Trained research nurses abstracted data from medical records to generate quality measures for a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without, and 102 patients with, specialty palliative care (SPC) services.; RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 16 to 99 years, 50% were women, and 24% were African American. Of 34 PEACE quality measures, 17 were feasible for hospital palliative care. Inter-rater reliability was high (kappa>0.80) for all but two quality measures. Face validity was endorsed by clinical service leaders, and construct validity was established by higher scores for patients receiving SPC. Comprehensive palliative care assessment was completed for only 10% of seriously ill hospitalized patients, compared with 56% of patients with SPC (p<0.001). Patients with moderate or severe pain were more likely to have a clinical assessment with SPC (67% versus 42%, p=0.002). Patients with SPC more often received attention for their emotional and spiritual needs (64% versus 40%, p<0.001) and documentation of preferences for life-sustaining treatments (91% versus 59%, p>0.001). Usability was endorsed by service leaders, who initiated two practice improvement projects.; CONCLUSION: PEACE quality measures are feasible and reliable, and may be useful to examine and improve the quality of palliative care for seriously ill hospitalized patients as well as for patients in hospice. Research is needed to test measures for actionability and responsiveness to intervention.

AB For most cancers, surgical therapy offers the only hope for cure. Nevertheless, evidence suggests wide variation in cancer care, and therefore it is imperative to ensure that high standards of care are being met. Few initiatives currently exist that are focused on cancer care quality, and there is no program measuring short-term surgical outcomes following cancer surgery. Improvements in care will likely come from performance programs that provide reliable, robust, and actionable information in a timely manner such that performance feedback can occur more frequently and at earlier stages in the treatment and disease process.

AB Public health readiness has increased at all jurisdictional levels because of increased sensitivity to threats. Since 2001, with billions of dollars invested to bolster the public health system's capacity, the public expects that public health will identify the etiology of and respond to events more rapidly. However, when etiologies are unknown at the onset of the investigation but interventions must be implemented, public health practitioners must benefit from past investigations' lessons to strengthen preparedness for emerging threats.  We have identified such potentially actionable lessons learned from historically important public health events that occurred primarily as syndromes for which the etiological agent initially was unknown.  Ongoing analysis of investigations can advance our capability to recognize and investigate syndromes and other problems and implement the most appropriate interventions.

AB PURPOSE: This study aimed at developing and measuring a set of indicators to monitor the quality of breast cancer care, to make comparisons over time and to support quality improvement for all practitioners and centres involved in the care of breast cancer women.; METHODS: Quality indicators were identified from a systematic literature search and the 2010 Belgian evidence-based clinical practice guideline. The selection process involved an expert panel evaluating reliability, relevance, interpretability and actionability of each indicator. The quality indicators were tested using the Belgian Cancer Registry data linked with claims data for all women registered with breast cancer in Belgium between 2001 and 2006 (n=50,039).; RESULTS: The selection process led to a final set of 32 indicators. Of these, 12 were measurable using the available data, while 1 indicator was measurable using proxy information. Five-year relative survival was 98%, 87%, 68% and 29% for pStage I, II, III and cStage IV respectively. Overall 5-year survival slightly improved for pStage II, III and cStage IV between 2001 and 2004. Of the surgically treated women, 60% underwent breast conserving surgery, 85% received adjuvant systemic treatment and 86% were irradiated postoperatively. In 80% of women treated for breast cancer, at least one mammography was performed within one year after the last treatment.; CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the feasibility to develop a multidisciplinary set of quality indicators for breast cancer. Using national cancer registry data linked to claims data, 13 indicators were measurable, showing results that largely correspond to other studies in the field. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although the importance of research mentorship has been well established, the role of mentors of junior clinical and translational science investigators is not clearly defined. The authors attempt to derive a list of actionable competencies for mentors from a series of complementary methods. We examined focus groups, the literature, competencies derived for clinical and translational scholars, mentor training curricula, mentor evaluation forms and finally conducted an expert panel process in order to compose this list. These efforts resulted in a set of competencies that include generic competencies expected of all mentors, competencies specific to scientists, and competencies that are clinical and translational research specific. They are divided into six thematic areas: (1) Communication and managing the relationship, (2) Psychosocial support, (3) Career and professional development, (4) Professional enculturation and scientific integrity, (5) Research development, and (6) Clinical and translational investigator development. For each thematic area, we have listed associated competencies, 19 in total. For each competency, we list examples that are actionable and measurable. Although a comprehensive approach was used to derive this list of competencies, further work will be required to parse out how to apply and adapt them, as well future research directions and evaluation processes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: In the past three decades, the role of pharmacists has evolved toward working with other health professionals and the public in a patient-centered model of practice, which is called pharmaceutical care. This model has been implemented for most physical illnesses but in relation to mental health, pharmacists' role is still evolving.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate pharmacists' attitudes, current practice, perceived barriers and training needs concerning pharmaceutical care for people with depression.; SETTING: All pharmacists attending obligatory regional meetings of the Surplus Network (a Flemish community pharmacy chain) during April and May 2009.; METHOD: Written survey consisting of questions on (1) pharmacists' attitude and current practice in depression care and pharmaceutical care for people with other illnesses; (2) potential barriers in providing pharmaceutical care for people with depression; and (3) training needs. Paired samples T tests and Wilcoxon-tests were used to analyze the data.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Attitude and current practice in depression care versus care for other illnesses.; RESULTS: Although the results show no difference in the attitude of pharmacists toward providing care for people with depression versus other illnesses (p = 0.315), pharmacists report to provide significantly less care to people with depression compared to people with other illnesses (p < 0.05). Perceived barriers toward providing depression care were the lack of information about the person and their treatment, the fact that depression is a difficult condition, the lack of education in mental health and the lack of time and privacy in the pharmacy. These, and the reported training needs, may limit the self-efficacy of pharmacists and hence influence current practice.; CONCLUSION: In spite of pharmacists' positive attitude toward depression care, current practice displays actionable flaws. Barriers and training needs should be addressed in order to improve pharmaceutical care for people with depression.

AB BACKGROUND: School-based body mass index (BMI) or body composition screening is increasing, but little is known about the process of parent notification. Since 2001, California has required annual screening of body composition via the FITNESSGRAM, with optional notification. This study sought to identify the prevalence of parental notification when screening is required but notification is optional, and the methods and messages used.; METHODS: Researchers conducted phone interviews with 851 school districts (89%) in California and reviewed notification materials from 54 districts.; RESULTS: As of 2008, 53% of California districts notified parents of screening results. Many districts (24%) did not know the reason for their notification policy. Most districts notified parents via a letter mailed home (70%) or sent home with the child (18%). Whereas 79% of sample letters provided students' BMI, only 12% provided an explanation of BMI, and only half provided tips on what parents should do if concerned about their child's results.; CONCLUSIONS: In California, where body composition screening is required but parent notification is not, approximately half of school districts elect to notify parents of results, most commonly via letter. Most letters do not explain BMI or percent body fat scores, nor do they suggest what parents should do for a child identified as at-risk. Further research to identify interpretable and actionable notification messages for parents will be critical if school-based BMI and body composition screening and notification is to reduce childhood obesity.

AB BACKGROUND: Diagnostic informatics (DI) in the context of personalized medicine involves the integration of molecular information to provide "actionable" diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In many cases, retrospective predictions of clinical outcomes affected by multiple genes are complicated by not having the relevant genes measured within the same study. Multiplicative effect modeling is a statistical method for estimating the net effect of ≥ 2 independent variables. The authors demonstrate a DI approach that uses multiplicative-effect modeling to combine genetic information from ≥ 2 independent studies to predict a net clinical outcome.; METHODS: As a hypothetical working model, 2 independent studies were selected each reporting on a unique genetic factor proposed to influence the risk of stent thrombosis (ST) among subjects treated with clopidogrel. A multiplicative effect model was used for developing a hypothesis regarding their combined influence on clinical outcome.; RESULTS: Application of multiplicative risk modeling yielded a revised estimated risk of outcomes based on combined genotype. In this scenario, combined genotype revised the categorical risk level (high versus low) estimated from single gene effects for 41.5% of the subjects. Further, the maximum relative risk based on single gene effects was increased from 4.54 to 7.84 based on combined genotype. The revised relative risk values in conjunction with combined genotype frequency estimates provides the data necessary to frame a trial hypothesis and conduct appropriate power analysis to estimate the number of subjects needed to test that hypothesis.; CONCLUSIONS: This DI approach can be used to generate quantitative hypotheses on multiple gene effects derived from independent genotype studies. This approach is useful for estimating parameters needed in designing future studies to evaluate the net effect of ≥ 2 genetic variants on a common clinical endpoint.

AB Rheumatologists see patients with a range of autoimmune diseases. Phenotyping these diseases for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of therapies is an ever increasing problem. Advances in multiplexed assay technology at the gene, protein, and cellular level have enabled the identification of 'actionable biomarkers'; that is, biological metrics that can inform clinical practice. Not only will such biomarkers yield insight into the development, remission, and exacerbation of a disease, they will undoubtedly improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of classification, and ultimately guide treatment. This Review provides an introduction to these powerful technologies that could promote the identification of actionable biomarkers, including mass cytometry, protein arrays, and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor high-throughput sequencing. In our opinion, these technologies should become part of routine clinical practice for the management of autoimmune diseases. The use of analytical tools to deconvolve the data obtained from use of these technologies is also presented here. These analyses are revealing a more comprehensive and interconnected view of the immune system than ever before and should have an important role in directing future treatment approaches for autoimmune diseases.

AB Despite a growing interest in health care quality improvement, little has changed regarding how clinicians acquire, assimilate, and transfer knowledge concerning leading practices. Working with hospitals with recognized leading clinical practices, VHA Inc developed an innovative methodology for generating and transferring knowledge using a visual story format that incorporates structural, process, and contextual elements into a comprehensive knowledge transfer vehicle called a VHA Leading Practice Blueprint. The authors describe a validation study comparing the effectiveness of the Blueprint methodology as a knowledge transfer vehicle to 2 commonly used sources of performance improvement knowledge: traditional case study and peer-reviewed journal article. Six dimensions-display, content, transferability, recall, diffusion, and actionable-were evaluated. Analysis of data indicates that the Blueprint methodology was judged superior to case studies and peer-reviewed articles on all 6 dimensions. The Blueprint methodology appears to hold promise as a new medium for conveying leading practices in health care.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review Australian mental health initiatives involving coordination of care.; METHODS: Commonwealth government websites were systematically searched for mental health policy documents. Database searches were also conducted using the terms 'coordination' or 'integration' and 'mental health' or 'mental illness' and 'Australia'. We assessed the extent to which informational, relational and management continuity have been addressed in three example programs.; RESULTS: The lack of definition of coordination at the policy level reduces opportunities for developing actionable and measurable programs. Of the 51 mental health initiatives identified, the three examples studied all demonstrated some use of the dimensions of continuity to facilitate coordination. However, problems with funding, implementation, evaluation and competing agendas between key stakeholders were barriers to improving coordination.; CONCLUSIONS: Coordination is possible and can improve both relationships between providers and care provided. However, clear leadership, governance and funding structures are needed to manage the challenges encountered, and evaluation using appropriate outcome measures, structured to assess the elements of continuity, is necessary to detect improvements in coordination.

AB Personalized targeted therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) primarily relies on the concept of "oncogene addiction," in which multiple genetic abnormalities are addicted to one or a few genes for tumor cell maintenance and survival. Several molecular aberrations have been identified in NSCLC, with subsequent development of drugs targeted to these aberrations; gefitinib, erlotinib, and cetuximab for the treatment of NSCLC harboring epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or overexpression, and crizotinib for the treatment of NSCLC with the EML4-ALK fusion translocation oncogene being some examples. A more recent actionable target is MET, a multifaceted receptor tyrosine kinase within the human kinome. Cellular heterogeneity within an oncogene-addicted tumor can cause resistance to targeted therapy after an initial response. As our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and tumor resistance mechanisms evolves, more rational therapies and combinations of therapies can be expected.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Next to adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is the most frequent histologic subtype in non-small cell lung cancer. Encouraging new treatments (i.e., bevacizumab, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and ALK inhibitors) have afforded benefits to patients with adenocarcinoma, but unfortunately the same is not true for SCC. However, many genomic abnormalities are present in SCC, and there is growing evidence of their biologic significance. Thus, in the short term, the molecular characterization of patients with SCC in modern profiling platforms will probably be as important as deciphering the molecular genetics of adenocarcinoma. Patients with SCC of the lung harboring specific molecular defects that are actionable (e.g., fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 amplification, discoidin domain receptor 2 mutation, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase amplification) should be enrolled in prospective clinical trials targeting such molecular defects. ©2012 AACR.

AB Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important clinical and public health concern. Although DDI screening now occurs during drug development, it is difficult to predict clinical importance based on in vitro experiments. Furthermore, older drugs that were not screened may have interactions that have not yet been identified. In this Commentary, we review the importance of DDIs and argue that a translational research approach is needed to produce clinically actionable information as well as generalizable biological knowledge.

Delivery of actionable drug information within EHRs unites providers, patients,professional liability carriers, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because it improves safety and decreases liability/costs. At PDR Network, we deliver full labeling, warnings,risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), adverse event reporting, and adherence services within the provider's workflow, across multiple EHRs.

AB PURPOSE: This study aimed at developing and measuring an indicator set to monitor the quality of testicular cancer care, to make comparisons over time and to support quality improvement for all practitioners and centres involved in the care of testicular cancer patients.; METHODS: Quality indicators were identified from a systematic literature search and from the 2010 Belgian evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The selection process involved an expert panel evaluating reliability, relevance, interpretability and actionability of each indicator. The quality indicators were pilot tested using the Belgian Cancer Registry (BCR) data linked with claims data for 1307 men with testicular cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2006. The variability between centres was displayed using funnel plots.; RESULTS: Of the 12 finally selected indicators, 5 were fully and 1 was partly measurable, while 2 indicators were measurable using proxy information. Five-year relative survival was 97%, 95% and 76% for pStage I-III, respectively. Overall 5-year survival slightly improved from 91% in 2001 to 94% in 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, 14 of 97 centres performed ≥10 orchidectomies. Large variability was found between centres. The nine centres with a 5-year observed survival below the lower limit treated less than 20 patients between 2001 and 2006.; CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the feasibility to develop a multidisciplinary set of quality indicators for testicular cancer. Using national cancer registry data linked to claims data, eight indicators were measurable, showing a mixed picture of the quality of care for testicular cancer patients in Belgium.

AB The U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration's (DOE/NNSA) Aerial Measuring System (AMS) deployed personnel and equipment to partner with the U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ) to conduct multiple aerial radiological surveys. These were the first and most comprehensive sources of actionable information for U.S. interests in Japan and provided early confirmation to the Government of Japan as to the extent of the release from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Many challenges were overcome quickly during the first 48 h, including installation and operation of Aerial Measuring System equipment on multiple USFJ aircraft, flying over difficult terrain, and flying with USFJ pilots who were unfamiliar with the Aerial Measuring System flight patterns. These factors combined to make for a programmatically unanticipated situation. In addition to the challenges of multiple and ongoing releases, integration with the Japanese government to provide valid aerial radiological survey products that both military and civilian customers could use to make informed decisions was extremely complicated. The Aerial Measuring System Fukushima response provided insight into addressing these challenges and gave way to an opportunity for the expansion of the Aerial Measuring System's mission beyond the borders of the U.S.

AB The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of a novel quality-improvement (QI) program designed to incorporate multiple robotic surgical sub-specialties in one health care system. A robotic surgery quality assessment program was developed by The Ohio State University College of Medicine (OSUMC) in conjunction with The Ohio State University Medical Center Quality Improvement and Operations Department. A retrospective review of cases was performed using data interrogated from the OSUMC Information Warehouse from January 2007 through August 2009. Robotic surgery cases (n=2200) were assessed for operative times, length of stay (LOS), conversions, returns to surgery, readmissions and cancellations as potential quality indicators. An actionable and reproducible framework for the quality measurement and assessment of a multidisciplinary and interdepartmental robotic surgery program was successfully completed demonstrating areas for improvement opportunities. This report supports that standard quality indicators can be applied to multiple specialties within a health care system to develop a useful quality tracking and assessment tool in the highly specialized area of robotic surgery. © 2012 National Association for Healthcare Quality.

AB BACKGROUND: Postdonation information (PDI) occurs when a donor fails to report a risk that would have resulted in deferral, but at some subsequent point is disclosed. Donors' perspectives on and perceived reasons for their PDIs have not been previously studied.; STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative interview study was conducted with PDI, appropriately deferred (and not PDI), and accepted donors from the six REDS-II blood centers. Telephone interviews were conducted with donors using semistructured discussion guides after their most recent donation or donation attempt. Salient themes were identified within and across the three donor categories using interview recordings and notes.; RESULTS: Sixty-six donors were interviewed (35 PDIs, 21 appropriately deferred, and 10 accepted). Cases could be grouped into one of three broad clusters according to the apparent primary reason for the PDI event: perceived changes in rules or application of more intensive screening procedures at this visit versus prior visit(s), issues of recall or interpretation of a question, and discrepancies in recollections of timing.; CONCLUSIONS: While descriptive and demographic information exists on the numbers and types of PDI events and donors, there has never been a qualitative study exploring donation experiences and possible reasons for their PDIs. This exploratory study based on semistructured interviews of donors identified several potentially actionable areas including the need for screeners to clarify the meaning of and answers to certain questions and helping donors accurately remember the details and dates of deferrable activities. © 2011 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB BACKGROUND: Finding measures to enhance the dissemination and implementation of their recommendations has become part of most health technology assessment (HTA) bodies' preoccupations. The Quebec government HTA organization in Canada observed that some of its projects relied on innovative practices in knowledge production and dissemination. A research was commissioned in order to identify what characterized these practices and to establish whether they could be systematized.; METHODS: An exploratory case study was conducted during summer and fall 2010 in the HTA agency in order to determine what made the specificity of its context, and to conceptualize an approach to knowledge production and dissemination that was adapted to the mandate and nature of this form of HTA organization. Six projects were selected. For each, the HTA report and complementary documents were analyzed, and semi-structured interviews were carried out. A narrative literature review of the most recent literature reviews of the principal knowledge into practice frameworks (2005-2010) and of articles describing such frameworks (2000-2010) was undertaken.; RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our observations highlighted an inherent difficulty as regards applying the dominant knowledge translation models to HTA and clinical guidance practices. For the latter, the whole process starts with an evaluation question asked in a problematic situation for which an actionable answer is expected. The objective is to produce the evidence necessary to respond to the decision-maker's request. The practices we have analyzed revealed an approach to knowledge production and dissemination, which was multidimensional, organic, multidirectional, dynamic, and dependent on interactions with stakeholders. Thus, HTA could be considered as a knowledge mobilization process per se.; CONCLUSIONS: HTA's purpose is to solve a problem by mobilizing the types of evidence required and the concerned actors, in order to support political, organizational or clinical decision-making. HTA relies on the mediation between contextual, colloquial and scientific evidence, as well as on interactions with stakeholders for recommendation making. Defining HTA as a knowledge mobilization process might contribute to consider the different orders of knowledge, the social, political and ethical dimensions, and the interactions with stakeholders, among the essential components required to respond to the preoccupations, needs and contexts of all actors concerned with the evaluation question's issues.

AB BACKGROUND: Double reading improves the cancer detection rate in mammography screening. Single reading with computer-aided detection (CAD) has been considered to be an alternative to double reading. Little is known about the potential benefit of CAD in breast cancer screening with double reading.; PURPOSE: To compare prospective independent double reading of screen-film (SFM) and full-field digital (FFDM) mammography in population-based screening with retrospective standalone CAD performance on the baseline mammograms of the screen-detected cancers and subsequent cancers diagnosed during the follow-up period.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study had ethics committee approval. A 5-point rating scale for probability of cancer was used for 23,923 (SFM = 16,983; FFDM = 6940) screening mammograms. Of 208 evaluable cancers, 104 were screen-detected and 104 were subsequent (44 interval and 60 next screening round) cancers. Baseline mammograms of subsequent cancers were retrospectively classified in consensus without information about cancer location, histology, or CAD prompting as normal, non-specific minimal signs, significant minimal signs, and false-negatives. The baseline mammograms of the screen-detected cancers and subsequent cancers were evaluated by CAD. Significant minimal signs and false-negatives were considered 'actionable' and potentially diagnosable if correctly prompted by CAD.; RESULTS: CAD correctly marked 94% (98/104) of the baseline mammograms of the screen-detected cancers (SFM = 95% [61/64]; FFDM = 93% [37/40]), including 96% (23/24) of those with discordant interpretations. Considering only those baseline examinations of subsequent cancers prospectively interpreted as normal and retrospectively categorized as 'actionable', CAD input at baseline screening had the potential to increase the cancer detection rate from 0.43% to 0.51% (P = 0.13); and to increase cancer detection by 16% ([104 + 17]/104) and decrease interval cancers by 20% (from 44 to 35).; CONCLUSION: CAD may have the potential to increase cancer detection by up to 16%, and to reduce the number of interval cancers by up to 20% in SFM and FFDM screening programs using independent double reading with consensus review. The influence of true- and false-positive CAD marks on decision-making can, however, only be evaluated in a prospective clinical study.

AB This review describes methods used in comparative effectiveness research (CER). The aim of CER is to improve decisions that affect medical care at the levels of both policy and the individual. The key elements of CER are (a) head-to-head comparisons of active treatments, (b) study populations typical of day-to-day clinical practice, and (c) a focus on evidence to inform care tailored to the characteristics of individual patients. These requirements will stress the principal methods of CER: observational research, randomized trials, and decision analysis. Observational studies are especially vulnerable because they use data that directly reflect the decisions made in usual practice. CER will challenge researchers and policy makers to think deeply about how to extract more actionable information from the vast enterprise of the daily practice of medicine. Fortunately, the methods are largely applicable to research in the public health system, which should therefore benefit from the intense interest in CER.
