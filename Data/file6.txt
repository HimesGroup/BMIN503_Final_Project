AB Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics provide rapid actionable information for patient care at the time and site of an encounter with the health care system. The usual platform has been the lateral flow immunoassay. Recently, emerging molecular diagnostics have met requirements for speed, low cost, and ease of use for POC applications. A major driver for POC development is the ability to diagnose infectious diseases at sites with a limited infrastructure. The potential use in both wealthy and resource-limited settings has fueled an intense effort to build on existing technologies and to generate new technologies for the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of infectious diseases.

AB OBJECTIVE: To better understand the consequences of returning whole genome sequencing (WGS) results in paediatrics and facilitate its evidence-based clinical implementation, we studied parents' experiences with WGS and their preferences for the return of adult-onset secondary variants (SVs)-medically actionable genomic variants unrelated to their child's current medical condition that predict adult-onset disease.; METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with parents whose children were undergoing WGS as part of the SickKids Genome Clinic, a research project that studies the impact of clinical WGS on patients, families, and the healthcare system. Interviews probed parents' experience with and motivation for WGS as well as their preferences related to SVs. Interviews were analysed thematically.; RESULTS: Of 83 invited, 23 parents from 18 families participated. These parents supported WGS as a diagnostic test, perceiving clear intrinsic and instrumental value. However, many parents were ambivalent about receiving SVs, conveying a sense of self-imposed obligation to take on the 'weight' of knowing their child's SVs, however unpleasant. Some parents chose to learn about adult-onset SVs for their child but not for themselves.; CONCLUSIONS: Despite general enthusiasm for WGS as a diagnostic test, many parents felt a duty to learn adult-onset SVs. Analogous to 'inflicted insight', we call this phenomenon 'inflicted ought'. Importantly, not all parents of children undergoing WGS view the best interests of their child in relational terms, thereby challenging an underlying justification for current ACMG guidelines for reporting incidental secondary findings from whole exome and WGS.

AB An in-depth evaluation of target safety is an invaluable resource throughout drug discovery and development. The goal of a target safety evaluation is to identify potential unintended adverse consequences of target modulation, and to propose a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to shepherd compounds through the discovery and development pipeline, to confirm and characterize unavoidable on-target toxicities in a timely manner to assist in early program advancement decisions, and to anticipate, monitor, and manage potential clinical adverse events. The role of an experienced discovery toxicologist in synthesizing the available information into an actionable set of recommendations for a safety evaluation strategy is critical to its successful application in early discovery programs. This chapter presents a summary of some of the information types and sources that should be investigated, and approaches that can be taken to generate an early assessment of potential safety liabilities.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) refractory to standard therapies have a poor prognosis. In this setting, recruitment into clinical trials is warranted, and studies driven by selection according to individual tumor molecular characteristics are expected to provide added value.; OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with mCRC refractory to or following failure of standard therapies who were enrolled into phase I/II clinical studies at the Niguarda Cancer Center based on the presence of a specific molecular profile expected to represent the target of susceptibility to the experimental drug(s).; PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 2011 to May 2016, 2044 patients with mCRC underwent molecular screening. Eighty patients (3.9%) were enrolled in ad hoc studies; the median age was 60years (range 36-86) and the median number of previous treatment lines was five (range 2-8). Molecular characteristics exploited within these studies were MGMT promoter hypermethylation (48.7%), HER2 amplification (28.8%), BRAF V600E mutation (20%), and novel gene fusions involving ALK or NTRK (2.5%).; RESULTS: One patient (1%) had RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) complete response (CR), 13 patients (16.5%) experienced a partial response (PR), and 28 (35%) stable disease (SD). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.8months (range 2.63-3.83), with 24% of patients displaying PFS >5months. Median growth modulation index (GMI) was 0.85 (range 0-15.61) and 32.5% of patients had GMI>1.33. KRAS exon 2 mutations were found in 38.5% of patients, and among the 78 patients with known KRAS status, those with wild-type tumors had longer PFS than those with mutated tumors (3.80 [95% CI 2.80-5.03] vs. 2.13months [95% CI 1.77-2.87], respectively, p=0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 7.83months (range 7.17-9.33) for all patients, and patients with KRAS wild-type tumors had longer OS than those with mutated tumors (7.83 [95% CI 7.33-10.80] vs. 7.18months [95% CI 5.63-9.33], respectively, p=0.06).; CONCLUSIONS: This single-institution retrospective study indicates that in a heavily pretreated population approximately 4% of mCRC tumors display a potential actionable molecular context suitable for therapeutic intervention. Application of molecular selection is challenging but improves clinical outcome even in later lines of treatment.

AB Genomic rearrangements that give rise to oncogenic gene fusions can offer actionable targets for cancer therapy. Here we present a systematic analysis of oncogenic gene fusions among a clinically well-characterized, prospectively collected set of 278 primary colon cancers spanning diverse tumor stages and clinical outcomes. Gene fusions and somatic genetic variations were identified in fresh frozen clinical specimens by Illumina RNA-sequencing, the STAR fusion gene detection pipeline, and GATK RNA-seq variant calling. We considered gene fusions to be pathogenically relevant when recurrent, producing divergent gene expression (outlier analysis), or as functionally important (e.g., kinase fusions). Overall, 2.5% of all specimens were defined as harboring a relevant gene fusion (kinase fusions 1.8%). Novel configurations of BRAF, NTRK3, and RET gene fusions resulting from chromosomal translocations were identified. An R-spondin fusion was found in only one tumor (0.35%), much less than an earlier reported frequency of 10% in colorectal cancers. We also found a novel fusion involving USP9X-ERAS formed by chromothripsis and leading to high expression of ERAS, a constitutively active RAS protein normally expressed only in embryonic stem cells. This USP9X-ERAS fusion appeared highly oncogenic on the basis of its ability to activate AKT signaling. Oncogenic fusions were identified only in lymph node-negative tumors that lacked BRAF or KRAS mutations. In summary, we identified several novel oncogenic gene fusions in colorectal cancer that may drive malignant development and offer new targets for personalized therapy.

AB Ethnically specific data on genetic variation are crucial for understanding human biology and for clinical interpretation of variant pathogenicity. We analyzed data obtained by deep sequencing 1303 Korean whole exomes; the data were generated by three independent whole exome sequencing projects (named the KOEX study). The primary focus of this study was to comprehensively analyze the variant statistics, investigate secondary findings that may have clinical actionability, and identify loci that should be cautiously interpreted for pathogenicity. A total of 495729 unique variants were identified at exonic regions, including 169380 nonsynonymous variants and 4356 frameshift insertion/deletions. Among these, 76607 were novel coding variants. On average, each individual had 7136 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants and 74 frameshift insertion/deletions. We classified 13 pathogenic and 13 likely pathogenic variants in 56 genes that may have clinical actionability according to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology. The carrier frequency of these 26 variants was 2.46% (95% confidence interval 1.73-3.46). To identify loci that require cautious interpretation in clinical sequencing, we identified 18 genes that are prone to sequencing errors, and 671 genes that are highly polymorphic and carry excess nonsynonymous variants. The catalog of identified variants, its annotation and frequency information are publicly available (http://koex.snu.ac.kr). These findings should be useful resources for investigating ethnically specific characteristics in human health and disease.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Identifying target genetic mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for therapy is made challenging by intratumoral heterogeneity. Circulating cell-free DNAs (cfDNA) may contain a more complete mutational spectrum compared to a single tumor sample. This study aimed to identify the most efficient strategy to identify all the mutations within heterogeneous HCCs.; METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted deep sequencing (TDS) were carried out in 32 multi-regional tumor samples from five patients. Matched preoperative cfDNAs were sequenced accordingly. Intratumoral heterogeneity was measured using the average percentage of non-ubiquitous mutations (present in parts of tumor regions). Profiling efficiencies of single tumor specimen and cfDNA were compared. The strategy with the highest performance was used to screen for actionable mutations.; RESULTS: Variable levels of heterogeneity with branched and parallel evolution patterns were observed. The heterogeneity decreased at higher sequencing depth of TDS compared to measurements by WES (28.1% vs. 34.9%, p<0.01) but remained unchanged when additional samples were analyzed. TDS of single tumor specimen identified an average of 70% of the total mutations from multi-regional tissues. Although genome profiling efficiency of cfDNA increased with sequencing depth, an average of 47.2% total mutations were identified using TDS, suggesting that tissue samples outperformed it. TDS of single tumor specimen in 66 patients and cfDNAs in four unresectable HCCs showed that 38.6% (26/66 and 1/4) of patients carried mutations that were potential therapeutic targets.; CONCLUSIONS: TDS of single tumor specimen could identify actionable mutations targets for therapy in HCC. cfDNA may serve as secondary alternative in profiling HCC genome.; LAY SUMMARY: Targeted deep sequencing of single tumor specimen is a more efficient method to identify mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma made from mixed subtypes compared to circulating cell-free DNA in blood. cfDNA may serve as secondary alternative in profiling HCC genome. Identifying mutations may help clinicians choose targeted therapy for better individual treatments. Copyright © 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB HIV-related stigma has been associated with a reluctance to test for HIV among Latinos. This study assessed community HIV-related stigma within an emerging Latino immigrant receiving city. We conducted a brief survey among a convenience sample of 312 Spanish-speaking Latinos in Baltimore, Maryland. HIV-related stigma was assessed through six items. Associations between stigma items, socio-demographic characteristics, and HIV testing history were considered. Gender, education, and religiosity were significantly associated with stigmatizing HIV-related beliefs. For example, men were 3.4 times more likely to hold more than three stigmatizing beliefs than women, and were also twice as likely as women to report feeling hesitant to test for HIV for fear of people's reaction if the test is positive. These findings can help inform future stigma interventions in this community. In particular, we were able to distinguish between drivers of stigma such as fear and moralistic attitudes, highlighting specific actionable items.

AB PURPOSE: To establish a baseline for care and overall survival (OS) based upon contemporary first-line treatments prescribed in the era before the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, for people with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without common actionable mutations.; METHODS: Using a nationally representative electronic health record data from the Flatiron dataset which included 162 practices from different regions in US, we identified patients (≥18 years old) newly diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC initiating first-line anticancer therapy (November 2012- January 2015, with follow-up through July 2015). Patients with documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation were excluded. Anti-cancer drug therapy and overall survival were described overall, and by histology.; RESULTS: A total of 2,014 patients with stage IV NSCLC without known EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations initiated systemic anticancer therapy, 22% with squamous and 78% with nonsquamous histology. Their mean (SD) age was 67 (10) years, 55% were male, and 87% had a smoking history. In nonsquamous NSCLC, carboplatin plus pemetrexed either without (25.7%) or with bevacizumab (16%) were the most common regimens; 26.6% of nonsquamous patients receiving induction therapy also received continuation maintenance therapy. In squamous NSCLC, carboplatin plus paclitaxel (37.6%) or nab-paclitaxel (21.1%) were the most commonly used regimens. Overall median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI: 9.1, 10.3), 8.5 months (95% CI: 7.4, 10.0) for squamous, and 10.0 months (95% CI: 9.4, 10.8) for nonsquamous NSCLC.; CONCLUSION: The results provide context for evaluating the effect of shifting treatment patterns of NSCLC treatments on patient outcomes, and for community oncology benchmarking initiatives.

AB Whole genome or exome sequencing is increasingly used in the clinical contexts, and 'incidental' findings are generated. There is need for an adequate policy for the reporting of these findings to individuals. Such a policy has been suggested by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We argue that ACMG's policy is overly paternalistic, and that an adequate policy must take into account population preferences. We conducted a choice based conjoint survey of population preferences for reporting in a representative sample of the Danish population. In a 12 task survey respondents were asked about their preference for reporting in relation to three scenarios with seven different attributes. Of 1200 respondents 66.4% participated. We show that population preferences for reporting differs from ACMG's recommendations, and suggest a new policy based on both medically and patient actionable genes.

AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Emergency department (ED) patients with acute low back pain (LBP) may present with ambiguous clinical findings that pose diagnostic challenges to exclude cauda equina syndrome (CES). As a proof of concept, we aimed to determine the efficacy of a rapid lumbar spine (LS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening protocol consisting of a single 3D-T2 SPACE FS (3D-T2 Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution fat saturated) sequence relative to conventional LS MRI to exclude emergently treatable pathologies in this complex patient population.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: LS MRI protocol including a sagittal 3D-T2 SPACE FS pulse sequence was added to the routine for ED patients presenting with acute atypical LBP over a 12-month period. Imaging findings were categorically scored on the 3D-T2 SPACE FS sequence and separately on the reference standard conventional LS MRI sequences. Patients' symptoms were obtained from review of the electronic medical record. Descriptive test statistics were performed.; RESULTS: Of the 206 ED patients who obtained MRI for acute atypical LBP, 118 (43.3±13.5 years of age; 61 female) were included. Specific pathologies detected on reference standard conventional MRI included disc herniation (n=30), acute fracture (n=3), synovial cyst (n=3), epidural hematoma (n=2), cerebrospinal fluid leak (n=1), and leptomeningeal metastases (n=1), and on multiple occasions these pathologies resulted in nerve root impingement (n=36), severe spinal canal stenosis (n=13), cord/conus compression (n=2), and cord signal abnormality (n=2). The 3D-T2 SPACE FS sequence was an effective screen for fracture (sensitivity [sens]=100%, specificity [spec]=100%), cord signal abnormality (sens=100%, spec=99%), and severe spinal canal stenosis (sens=100%, spec=96%), and identified cord compression not seen on reference standard. Motion artifact was not seen on the 3D-T2 SPACE FS but noted on 8.5% of conventional LS MRI.; CONCLUSIONS: The 3D-T2 SPACE FS sequence MRI is a rapid, effective screen for emergently actionable pathologies that might be a cause of CES in ED patients presenting with acute atypical LBP. As this abbreviated, highly sensitive sequence requires a fraction of the acquisition time of conventional LS MRI, it has the potential of contributing to increased efficiencies in the radiology department and improved ED throughput.

AB Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are clinically disparate primary liver cancers with etiological and biological heterogeneity. We identified common molecular subtypes linked to similar prognosis among 199 Thai ICC and HCC patients through systems integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. While ICC and HCC share recurrently mutated genes, including TP53, ARID1A, and ARID2, mitotic checkpoint anomalies distinguish the C1 subtype with key drivers PLK1 and ECT2, whereas the C2 subtype is linked to obesity, Tcell infiltration, and bile acid metabolism. These molecular subtypes are found in 582 Asian, but less so in 265 Caucasian patients. Thus, Asian ICC and HCC, while clinically treated as separate entities, share common molecular subtypes with similar actionable drivers to improve precision therapy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Competence in advanced critical care transesophageal echocardiography allows the intensivist to diagnose and manage cardiopulmonary failure when transthoracic echocardiography is not sufficient to answer the clinical question. This report describes the feasibility, safety, and utility of transesophageal echocardiography performed by pulmonary and critical care fellows in a medical ICU in critically ill patients who were mechanically ventilated.; METHODS: This longitudinal descriptive study of advanced transesophageal echocardiography was performed in patients who were mechanically ventilated. The complications and clinical utility of the examinations were abstracted from review of the image set, the written report, and the patient chart. Influence on diagnosis was classified as confirming the initial clinical diagnosis or identification of a new or unanticipated finding. Therapeutic impact was categorized as no change in therapy resulting from the study findings or as change in therapy resulting from the study findings.; RESULTS: The examination was feasible in all patients in whom it was attempted, and there were no complications of the procedure. New or actionable findings were identified in 43 (28%) studies, and 109 (72%) studies confirmed the initial clinical diagnosis. The findings resulted in a change in clinical management in 58 (38%) patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Critical care transesophageal echocardiography is feasible, safe, and has clinical utility. It can be safely and effectively performed by fellows within the context of their critical care training with faculty supervision. Pulmonary critical care fellowship training programs should consider introducing critical care transesophageal echocardiography as a useful clinical tool.

AB INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer, patients with metastatic cancer have limited therapeutic options after initial lines of therapy. Understanding tumor biology has translated into the identification of actionable targets that resulted in therapeutics. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are capitalizing on this explosion of scientific information. ADCs allow an antibody to a unique target to be conjugated via an innovative linker, to a highly toxic drug which is delivered to its target. Sacituzumab govitecan is an ADC that combines the active molecule in irinotecan, SN-38, to an antibody targeting trop2. Areas covered: In this review, the authors introduce the reader to the ADC sacituzumab govitecan providing the reader with details about its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety. The authors also give their expert analysis about its potential future use. Expert opinion: Sacituzumab govitecan is a novel and well-tolerated therapeutic showing promising results in difficult to treat cancers. Further studies are underway to optimize the group of patients that would benefit from it. Given its excellent performance, we are cautiously optimistic it will be approved by the FDA.

AB Defining the genetic drivers of cancer progression is a key in understanding disease biology and developing effective targeted therapies. Chromosome rearrangements are a common feature of human malignancies, but whether they represent bona fide cancer drivers and therapeutically actionable targets, requires functional testing. Here, we describe the generation of transgenic, inducible CRISPR-based mouse systems to engineer and study recurrent colon cancer-associated EIF3E-RSPO2 and PTPRK-RSPO3 chromosome rearrangements in vivo. We show that both Rspo2 and Rspo3 fusion events are sufficient to initiate hyperplasia and tumour development in vivo, without additional cooperating genetic events. Rspo-fusion tumours are entirely Wnt-dependent, as treatment with an inhibitor of Wnt secretion, LGK974, drives rapid tumour clearance from the intestinal mucosa without effects on normal intestinal crypts. Altogether, our study provides direct evidence that endogenous Rspo2 and Rspo3 chromosome rearrangements can initiate and maintain tumour development, and indicate a viable therapeutic window for LGK974 treatment of RSPO-fusion cancers.

AB A challenge in precision medicine requires identification of actionable driver mutations. Critical to such effort is the deployment of sensitive and well-validated assays for mutation detection. Although identification of such alterations within the tumor tissue remains the gold standard, many advanced non-small cell lung cancer cases have only limited tissue samples, derived from small biopsies or fine-needle aspirates, available for testing. More recently, noninvasive methods using either circulating tumor cells or tumor DNA (ctDNA) have become an alternative method for identifying molecular biomarkers and screening patients eligible for targeted therapies. In this article, we present a case of a 52-year-old never-smoking male who presented with widely metastatic atypical neuroendocrine tumor to the bones and the brain. Molecular genotyping using DNA harvested from a bone metastasis was unsuccessful due to limited material. Subsequent ctDNA analysis revealed an ALK translocation. The clinical significance of the mutation in this particular cancer type and therapeutic strategies are discussed.; KEY POINTS: To our knowledge, this index case represents the first reported ALK translocation identified in an atypical carcinoid tumor.Liquid biopsy such as circulating tumor DNA is a feasible alternative platform for identifying sensitizing genomic alterations.Second-generation ALK inhibitors represent a new paradigm for treating ALK-positive patients with brain metastases. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. However, the identification of oncogenic driver alterations involved in the initiation and maintenance of NSCLC, such as epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation, has led to the development of novel therapies that directly target mutant proteins and associated signaling pathways, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. As sequencing techniques have improved, the molecular heterogeneity of NSCLC has become apparent, leading to the identification of a number of potentially actionable oncogenic driver mutations. Of these, one of the most promising therapeutic targets is B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF). Mutations in BRAF, observed in 2%-4% of NSCLCs, typically lead to constitutive activation of the protein and, as a consequence, lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Direct inhibition of mutant BRAF and/or the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) has led to prolonged survival in patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. This comprehensive review will discuss the clinical characteristics and prognostic implications of BRAF-mutant NSCLC, the clinical development of BRAF and MEK inhibitors from melanoma to NSCLC, and practical considerations for clinicians involving BRAF mutation screening and the choice of targeted therapy.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Personalized medicine has begun to provide substantial benefit to patients with oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, treatment options for patients with oncogenic driver mutations lacking targeted treatment strategies remain limited. Direct inhibition of mutant B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and/or downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) has the potential to change the course of the disease for patients with BRAF-mutant NSCLC, as it has in BRAF-mutant melanoma. Optimization of screening strategies for rare mutations and the choice of appropriate agents on an individual basis will be key to providing timely and successful intervention. © 2017 The Authors.

AB Molecular profiling of actionable mutations in refractory cancer patients has the potential to enable "precision medicine," wherein individualized therapies are guided based on genomic profiling. The molecular-screening program was intended to route participants to different candidate drugs in trials based on clinical-sequencing reports. In this screening program, we used a custom target-enrichment panel consisting of cancer-related genes to interrogate single-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, copy number variants, and a subset of gene fusions. From August 2014 through April 2015, 654 patients consented to participate in the program at Samsung Medical Center. Of these patients, 588 passed the quality control process for the 381-gene cancer-panel test, and 418 patients were included in the final analysis as being eligible for any anticancer treatment (127 gastric cancer, 122 colorectal cancer, 62 pancreatic/biliary tract cancer, 67 sarcoma/other cancer, and 40 genitourinary cancer patients). Of the 418 patients, 55 (12%) harbored a biomarker that guided them to a biomarker-selected clinical trial, and 184 (44%) patients harbored at least one genomic alteration that was potentially targetable. This study demonstrated that the panel-based sequencing program resulted in an increased rate of trial enrollment of metastatic cancer patients into biomarker-selected clinical trials. Given the expanding list of biomarker-selected trials, the guidance percentage to matched trials is anticipated to increase.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study demonstrated that the panel-based sequencing program resulted in an increased rate of trial enrollment of metastatic cancer patients into biomarker-selected clinical trials.

AB In 2014 the World Health Organization called for palliative care to be integrated as an essential element of the health care continuum. Yet in 2017 US palliative care services are found largely in hospitals, and hospice care, which is delivered primarily in the home, is limited to people who are dying soon. The majority of Americans with a serious illness are not dying; are living at home, in assisted living facilities, or in nursing homes; and have limited access to palliative care. Most health care providers lack knowledge about and skills in pain and symptom management, communication, and care coordination, and both the public and health professionals are only vaguely aware of the benefits of palliative care and how and when to access it. The lack of policy supports for palliative care contributes to preventable suffering and low-value care. In this article we outline the need for a national palliative care strategy to ensure reliable access to high-quality palliative care for Americans with serious medical illnesses. We review approaches employed by other countries, list the participants needed to develop and implement an actionable strategy, and identify analogous US national health initiatives to inform a process for implementing the strategy.

AB Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of molecular screening of tumour samples for matching patients with cancer to targeted therapies. However, most of them have been carried out at institutional or national level. Herein, we report on the pilot phase of AURORA (NCT02102165), a European multinational collaborative molecular screening initiative for advanced breast cancer patients. Forty-one patients were prospectively enroled at four participating centres across Europe. Metastatic tumours were biopsied and profiled using an Ion Torrent sequencing platform at a central facility. Sequencing results were obtained for 63% of the patients in real-time with variable turnaround time stemming from delays between patient consent and biopsy. At least one clinically actionable mutation was identified in 73% of patients. We used the Illumina sequencing technology for orthogonal validation and achieved an average of 66% concordance of substitution calls per patient. Additionally, copy number aberrations inferred from the Ion Torrent sequencing were compared to single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and found to be 59% concordant on average. Although this study demonstrates that powerful next generation genomic techniques are logistically ready for international molecular screening programs in routine clinical settings, technical challenges remain to be addressed in order to ensure the accuracy and clinical utility of the genomic data.

AB Resealable packages are nowadays omnipresent on store shelves. While the main advantage of the resealability feature is its ability to reclose the package in order to extend the shelf life of the food product inside, the present research's aim is to assess whether this advantage also has implications for palatable, energy-dense food consumption. Two studies provide intentional as well as behavioral evidence for the claim that consumers are better able to self-regulate their consumption and thus eat less in one occasion when a palatable, energy-dense food product is offered in a resealable (vs. unresealable) package. A third study investigates the effect of package resealability across multiple consumption occasions and reveals that the resealability feature limits the volume consumed on each occasion (conditional on consumption incidence) while it does not accelerate consumption frequency, resulting in a lower total consumed volume of palatable, energy-dense snacks over a six-day period. This research offers actionable insights for consumer welfare and public health care and aids manufacturers in delineating optimal food packaging strategies. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global health systems are challenged by escalating costs and growing demands for care created by the demands of aging populations and rising rates of chronic illness which place unsustainable pressure on health systems to meet population health needs. To overcome these challenges, transformational change is needed to strengthen health system performance and sustainability. Innovation is widely viewed as the strategy to drive transformational change in health systems; yet to date, innovation has lacked a clearly defined focus or agenda to achieve transformation. An actionable innovation agenda is needed to achieve transformational change for health systems. The key conditions for success as an innovation strategy are examined, including clearly defined innovation objectives, key milestones, and actionable steps every system stakeholder must pursue in order to guide the innovation agenda and ultimately accelerate the transformational changes needed for a sustainable healthcare system that delivers value to populations.

AB Comprehensive tobacco control is considered by many to be a model for effective population health promotion and chronic disease prevention. Its history holds lessons for the "scalable, actionable, innovation agenda" called for by Anne Snowdon (2017). This commentary discusses lessons from tobacco control related to: changing practices in response to evolving paradigms and scientific evidence; international best practices; the importance of a broadly-accepted, shared vision about elements of an effective strategy; scientific and public service leadership; social actors leading change through advocacy, policy and the media; organizational learning mechanisms and capacity building systems; and, the importance of a continuously renewing, forward-looking agenda. The end-game for tobacco forms part of Canada's health innovation agenda and lessons from tobacco control may inform this important forward-looking strategy.

AB The authors who contributed to this issue of Healthcare Papers have provided rich insights into a promising innovation agenda to support transformational change aimed at achieving high-performing, person-centric health systems that are sustainable and deliver value. First and foremost, the commentaries make clear that a focused innovation agenda with defined goals, objectives and milestones is needed, if innovation is to be a viable and successful strategy to achieve health system transformation. To date, innovation has been a catch-all term for solving the many challenges health systems are experiencing. Yet, innovation on its own cannot fix all the ills of a health system; strategic goals and objectives are needed to define the way forward if innovation is to achieve value for Canadians. To this end, the authors identify goals and objectives that are worthy of serious consideration by all health system stakeholders.

AB Precision oncology implies the ability to predict which patients will likely respond to specific cancer therapies based on increasingly accurate, high-resolution molecular diagnostics as well as the functional and mechanistic understanding of individual tumors. While molecular stratification of patients can be achieved through different means, a promising approach is next-generation sequencing of tumor DNA and RNA, which can reveal genomic alterations that have immediate clinical implications. Furthermore, certain genetic alterations are shared across multiple histologic entities, raising the fundamental question of whether tumors should be treated by molecular profile and not tissue of origin. We here describe MASTER (Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research), a clinically applicable platform for prospective, biology-driven stratification of younger adults with advanced-stage cancer across all histologies and patients with rare tumors. We illustrate how a standardized workflow for selection and consenting of patients, sample processing, whole-exome/genome and RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, rigorous validation of potentially actionable findings, and data evaluation by a dedicated molecular tumor board enables categorization of patients into different intervention baskets and formulation of evidence-based recommendations for clinical management. Critical next steps will be to increase the number of patients that can be offered comprehensive molecular analysis through collaborations and partnering, to explore ways in which additional technologies can aid in patient stratification and individualization of treatment, to stimulate clinically guided exploratory research projects, and to gradually move away from assessing the therapeutic activity of targeted interventions on a case-by-case basis toward controlled clinical trials of genomics-guided treatments. © 2017 UICC.

AB Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides a potential non-invasive biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, but whether it could reflect tumor heterogeneity and monitor therapeutic responses in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. Focusing on 574 cancer genes known to harbor actionable mutations, we identified the mutation repertoire of HCC tissues, and monitored the corresponding ctDNA features in blood samples to evaluate its clinical significance. Analysis of 3 HCC patients' mutation profiles revealed that ctDNA could overcome tumor heterogeneity and provide information of tumor burden and prognosis. Further analysis was conducted on the 4th HCC case with multiple lesion samples and sequential plasma samples. We identified 160 subclonal SNVs in tumor tissues as well as matched peritumor tissues with PBMC as control. 96.9% of this patient's tissue mutations could be also detected in plasma samples. These subclonal SNVs were grouped into 9 clusters according to their trends of cellular prevalence shift in tumor tissues. Two clusters constituted of tumor stem somatic mutations showed circulating levels relating with cancer progression. Analysis of tumor somatic mutations revealed that circulating level of such tumor stem somatic mutations could reflect tumor burden and even predict prognosis earlier than traditional strategies. Furthermore, HCK (p.V174M), identified as a recurrent/metastatic related mutation site, could promote migration and invasion of HCC cells. Taken together, study of mutation profiles in biopsy and plasma samples in HCC patients showed that ctDNA could overcome tumor heterogeneity and real-time track the therapeutic responses in the longitudinal monitoring. © 2017 UICC.

AB Mesenchymal-type cancers after epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) were recently shown to acquire chemoresistance through expressing EMT specific transcription factors. However, druggable (or actionable) target(s) for chemoresistance in mesenchymal-type lung cancers remain unidentified. Here, we used a public clinical genomic database and mesenchymal lung cancer cells (MLCC) model derived from the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line to demonstrate that BCL2 expression, which is highly induced in mesenchymal-type lung cancers, as a predictor of poor prognosis in mesenchymal lung cancer patients and association with acquired chemoradioresistance. Thereby, combination treatment with BH3 mimetics, such as ABT-263 and ABT-737, clearly attenuated chemoresistance in MLCCs. BCL2 expression in MLCCs was induced by ERK1 activity through the upregulation of the MEK1/ERK1 scaffold protein MEK partner-1 (MP1). Interfering with the MEK1/MP1/ERK1 axis using a MEK1 inhibitor or MP1 depletion repressed BCL2 expression and sensitized MLCCs to chemoradiotherapy. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting druggable proteins in the MEK1/MP1/ERK1/BCL2 axis, such as MEK1 or BCL2, with currently available FDA approved drugs is a currently feasible approach to improve clinical outcomes of mesenchymal lung cancer patients.

AB Here, we explore the potential of single-cell genomic analysis in blood for early detection of cancer; we consider a method that screens the presence of recurrent patterns of copy number (CN) alterations using sparse single-cell sequencing. We argue for feasibility, based on in silico analysis of existing single-cell data and cancer CN profiles. Sampling procedures from existing diploid single cells can render data for a cell with any given profile. Sampling from multiple published tumor profiles can interrogate cancer clonality via an algorithm that tests the multiplicity of close pairwise similarities among single-cell cancer genomes. The majority of common solid cancers would be detectable in this manner. As any early detection method must be verifiable and actionable, we describe how further analysis of suspect cells can aid in determining risk and anatomic origin. Future affordability rests on currently available procedures for tumor cell enrichment and inexpensive methods for single-cell analysis. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB INTRODUCTION: We examined mutational testing of the epidermal growth factor gene (EGFR) and erlotinib treatment among veterans diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Our objectives were to identify the prevalence of clinically actionable EGFR mutations, to determine whether testing and treatment were guideline concordant, to evaluate the impact of testing and treatment on survival, and to estimate the rate of testing.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Test results were linked to electronic health records from VA Corporate Data Warehouse and the VA Central Cancer Registry. We analyzed patient demographic and clinical characteristics, prevalence of EGFR mutations, and timing of EGFR mutational testing and erlotinib treatment based on pharmacy records. Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis.; RESULTS: Among 973 patients tested at 70 VA medical centers between 2011 and 2013, 64 (7%) had sensitizing EGFR mutations, 694 (71%) were EGFR wild type, and 168 (17%) had clinically insignificant polymorphisms or variants of unknown significance. Results were not documented in 47 tests (5%). Erlotinib administration was in agreement with test results in 843 cases (87%).; CONCLUSION: Veterans have a much lower rate of sensitizing EGFR mutations than the reported average of 10% to 15%, which correlates with a high rate of smoking among veterans. This may partially explain clinicians' reluctance to prescribe EGFR testing, which results in underutilization. Although test results appear to have influenced erlotinib treatment decisions, we documented a substantial number of cases where treatment was not applied in accordance with clinical guidelines, potentially resulting in worse outcomes and unnecessary cost.

AB The utility of multigene panels in retesting patients who previously tested negative for a pathogenic mutation by BRCA1/2 testing is notwell established. Patients who previously tested negative for a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation by standard sequencing, and who were seen in cancer genetics center between November 1, 2012 and June 30, 2015 for additional testing utilizing multigene panels, were identified using our genetic testing registry. Data on demographics, personal and family history of cancer, results of panel testing and the impact on patient management was collected retrospectively. A total of 122 patients underwent retesting during the study period. Thirteen (11%) pathogenic mutations were identified in the following genes: CHEK2(4), PALB2(3), ATM(2), CDH1, APC, BARD1 and MRE11A. Eleven out of these thirteen mutations were deemed actionable based on published guidelines. Of these eleven, seven patients had an actual change in clinical management as a result of retesting. Furthermore, retesting also led to a change in clinical management in the two patients with mutations in genes (BARD1 and MRE11A) which do not have clear guidelines for management. There were no significant differences in demographics and personal and family history of cancer between patients who tested positive and those who tested negative on retesting. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of multigene panels in a group of high risk individuals who previously tested negative for a BRCA1/2 mutation. This retesting approach revealed a pathogenic mutation in 11% of cases. Retesting led to significant change in clinical management in a majority of patients with actionable mutations (7 out of 11), as well as in those with mutations in genes which do not have specific management guidelines.

AB Tacrolimus (Tac) is a profoundly effective immunosuppressant that reduces the risk of rejection after solid organ transplantation. However, its use is hampered by its narrow therapeutic window along with its highly variable pharmacological (pharmacokinetic [PK] and pharmacodynamic [PD]) profile. Part of this variability is explained by genetic polymorphisms affecting the metabolic pathway. The integration of CYP3A4 and CY3A5 genotype in tacrolimus population-based PK (PopPK) modeling approaches has been proven to accurately predict the dose requirement to reach the therapeutic window. The objective of the present study was to develop an accurate PopPK model in a cohort of 59 kidney transplant patients to deliver this information to clinicians in a clear and actionable manner. We conducted a non-parametric non-linear effects PopPK modeling analysis in Pmetrics. Patients were genotyped for the CYP3A422 and CYP3A53 alleles and were classified into 3 different categories [poor-metabolizers (PM), Intermediate-metabolizers (IM) or extensive-metabolizers (EM)]. A one-compartment model with double gamma absorption route described very accurately the tacrolimus PK. In covariate analysis, only CYP3A genotype was retained in the final model (Delta-2LL = -73). Our model estimated that tacrolimus concentrations were 33% IC95%[20-26%], 41% IC95%[36-45%] lower in CYP3A IM and EM when compared to PM, respectively. Virtually, we proved that defining different starting doses for PM, IM and EM would be beneficial by ensuring better probability of target concentrations attainment allowing us to define new dosage recommendations according to patient CYP3A genetic profile.

AB BACKGROUND: Thymic epithelial tumours are rare cancers for which new treatment options are required. Identification of putative predictive markers is important for developing clinical trials. We studied the expression of five putative predictive biomarkers, potentially actionable by approved experimental drugs.; METHODS: CD52, CD22, CD26, EG5, and IGF-1R expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed surgical samples of thymic epithelial tumour patients. All samples containing 10% positive epithelial tumour cells, independent of tumour cell intensity, were considered as positive. Correlation with histological subtype was performed.; RESULTS: 106 surgical samples (89 thymomas, 12 thymic carcinoma, and 5 thymic neuroendocrine tumours) were evaluated. Overall, CD52, CD22, CD26, EG5 and IGF-1R expression was observed in 7%, 42%, 25%, 42% and 77% of samples, respectively. CD52 expression was more frequent in B2 and B3 thymoma. All TET subtypes stained for CD22, mainly AB thymoma (68%). CD26 expression also correlated with AB thymoma (68%), and A thymoma (50%) subtype, while IGFR1 was the most common marker expressed by thymic carcinoma samples (92%), followed by EG5 (60%). Only EG5 expression was significantly higher in thymic carcinomas than in thymomas (75% vs. 38%, p=0.026).; CONCLUSIONS: Our data were consistent with a previous study of IGF-1R expression. Based on their expression, activity of agents targeting CD52, CD 22, CD26 and EG5 could be further explored in TET patients. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last few years, next-generation sequencing studies have provided insights into the mutational landscape of multiple myeloma. The identification of actionable mutations might give a precious opportunity for exploring new targeted therapies. Thus, the implementation of promising precision medicine strategies seems to be closer than ever. Throughout this review we describe the main challenges that should to be dealt with in this new era, in order to achieve the main goal of precision medicine, namely matching patients with their right drug. In addition, we provide a review of the most significant preclinical and clinical studies supporting the implementation of precision medicine nowadays. Finally, we highlight the need of clinical trials to evaluate the security and efficacy of these targeted therapies, as well as to validate predictive biomarkers that may allow an appropriate best-candidate selection and improvement of myeloma patients' survival and quality of life.

AB Discovering new medicines is difficult and increasingly expensive. The pharmaceutical industry has responded to this challenge by embracing open innovation to access external ideas. Historically, partnerships were usually bilateral, and the drug discovery process was shrouded in secrecy. This model is rapidly changing. With the advent of the Internet, drug discovery has become more decentralised, bottom-up, and scalable than ever before. The term open innovation is now accepted as just one of many terms that capture different but overlapping levels of openness in the drug discovery process. Many pharmaceutical companies recognise the advantages of revealing some proprietary information in the form of results, chemical tools, or unsolved problems in return for valuable insights and ideas. For example, such selective revealing can take the form of openly shared chemical tools to explore new biological mechanisms or by publicly admitting what is not known in the form of an open call. The essential ingredient for addressing these problems is access to the wider scientific crowd. The business of crowdsourcing, a form of outsourcing in which individuals or organisations solicit contributions from Internet users to obtain ideas or desired services, has grown significantly to fill this need and takes many forms today. Here, we posit that open-innovation approaches are more successful when they establish a reliable framework for converting creative ideas of the scientific crowd into practice with actionable plans.

AB BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has progressed after first-line therapy is an aggressive disease with few effective therapeutic strategies. In this prospective study, we employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify therapeutically actionable alterations to guide treatment for advanced SCLC patients.; METHODS: Twelve patients with SCLC were enrolled after failing platinum-based chemotherapy. Following informed consent, genome-wide exome and RNA-sequencing was performed in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited environment. Actionable targets were identified and therapeutic recommendations made from a pharmacopeia of FDA-approved drugs. Clinical response to genomically-guided treatment was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.; RESULTS: The study completed its accrual goal of 12 evaluable patients. The minimum tumor content for successful NGS was 20%, with a median turnaround time from sample collection to genomics-based treatment recommendation of 27 days. At least two clinically actionable targets were identified in each patient, and six patients (50%) received treatment identified by NGS. Two had partial responses by RECIST 1.1 on a clinical trial involving a PD-1 inhibitor + irinotecan (indicated by MLH1 alteration). The remaining patients had clinical deterioration before NGS recommended therapy could be initiated.; CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive genomic profiling using NGS identified clinically-actionable alterations in SCLC patients who progressed on initial therapy. Recommended PD-1 therapy generated partial responses in two patients. Earlier access to NGS guided therapy, along with improved understanding of those SCLC patients likely to respond to immune-based therapies, should help to extend survival in these cases with poor outcomes.

AB Hereditary hematologic malignancy (HM) syndromes are increasingly recognized as causative of adult hematopoietic cancers, and the advent of next-generation sequencing has accelerated the discovery of new syndromes based on dense clustering of these diseases in particular families. Updated classifications schemes for myeloid malignancies will now include recommendations for taking a family history on all patients diagnosed with hematopoietic malignancies and for genetic counseling and testing of appropriate individuals and families. Therefore, now more than ever, clinicians and pathologists will need to have a high index of suspicion and be familiar with the aspects of a patient's personal or family history that should raise suspicion regarding these syndromes as well as the options for clinical testing. Whenever possible, individuals should be tested with certified, clinical platforms that can detect both point mutations and genomic rearrangements that disrupt gene function so that results are immediately actionable. Individuals and families who test negative for mutations in the known germline predisposition genes serve as important sources of discovery for new inherited susceptibility syndromes.

AB BACKGROUND: Heat-related morbidity and mortality is a recognized public health concern. However, public health officials need to base policy decisions on local evidence, which is often lacking for smaller communities.; OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between maximum daily heat index (HI) and morbidity and mortality in 15 New England communities (combined population: 2.7 million) in order to provide actionable evidence for local officials.; METHODS: We applied overdispersed Poisson nonlinear distributed lag models to evaluate the association between HI and daily (May-September) emergency department (ED) admissions and deaths in each of 15 study sites in New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island, controlling for time trends, day of week, and federal holidays. Site-specific estimates were meta-analyzed to provide regional estimates.; RESULTS: Associations (sometimes non-linear) were observed between HI and each health outcome. For example, a day with a HI of 95°F vs. 75°F was associated with a cumulative 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5%, 8.5%) and 5.1% (95% CI: 0.2%, 10.3%) higher rate of all-cause ED visits and deaths, respectively, with some evidence of regional heterogeneity. We estimate that in the study area, days with a HI≥95°F were associated with an annual average of 784 (95% CI: 658, 908) excess ED visits and 22 (95% CI: 3, 39) excess deaths.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the presence of adverse health impacts associated with HI below the current local guideline criteria of HI≥100°F used to issue heat advisories. We hypothesize that lowering this threshold may lead to substantially reduced heat-related morbidity and mortality in the study area. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The quest for credible and actionable evidence to improve decision making, foster improvement, enhance self-determination, and promote social betterment is now a global phenomenon. Evaluation theorists and practitioners alike have responded to and overcome the challenges that limited the effectiveness and usefulness of traditional evaluation approaches primarily focused on seeking rigorous scientific knowledge about social programs and policies. No modern evaluation approach has received a more robust welcome from stakeholders across the globe than empowerment evaluation. Empowerment evaluation has been a leader in the development of stakeholder involvement approaches to evaluation, setting a high bar. In addition, empowerment evaluation's respect for community knowledge and commitment to the people's right to build their own evaluation capacity has influenced the evaluation mainstream, particularly concerning evaluation capacity building. Empowerment evaluation's most significant contributions to the field have been to improving evaluation use and knowledge utilization. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rapid growth in data sharing presents new opportunities across the spectrum of biomedical research. Global efforts are underway to develop practical guidance for implementation of data sharing and open data resources. These include the recent recommendation of 'FAIR Data Principles', which assert that if data is to have broad scientific value, then digital representations of that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The spinal cord injury (SCI) research field has a long history of collaborative initiatives that include sharing of preclinical research models and outcome measures. In addition, new tools and resources are being developed by the SCI research community to enhance opportunities for data sharing and access. With this in mind, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted a workshop on October 5-6, 2016 in Bethesda, MD, in collaboration with the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (ODC-SCI) titled "Preclinical SCI Data: Creating a FAIR Share Community". Workshop invitees were nominated by the workshop steering committee (co-chairs: ARF and VPL; members: AC, KDA, MSB, KF, LBJ, PGP, JMS), to bring together junior and senior level experts including preclinical and basic SCI researchers from academia and industry, data science and bioinformatics experts, investigators with expertise in other neurological disease fields, clinical researchers, members of the SCI community, and program staff representing federal and private funding agencies. The workshop and ODC-SCI efforts were sponsored by the International Spinal Research Trust (ISRT), the Rick Hansen Institute, Wings for Life, the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation and NINDS. The number of attendees was limited to ensure active participation and feedback in small groups. The goals were to examine the current landscape for data sharing in SCI research and provide a path to its future. Below are highlights from the workshop, including perspectives on the value of data sharing in SCI research, workshop participant perspectives and concerns, descriptions of existing resources and actionable directions for further engaging the SCI research community in a model that may be applicable to many other areas of neuroscience. This manuscript is intended to share these initial findings with the broader research community, and to provide talking points for continued feedback from the SCI field, as it continues to move forward in the age of data sharing.

AB Neurodegenerative diseases are rarely caused by a mutation in a single gene but rather influenced by a combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Emerging high-throughput technologies such as RNA sequencing have been instrumental in deciphering the molecular landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, however, the interpretation of such large amounts of data remains a challenge. Network biology has become a powerful platform to integrate multiple omics data to comprehensively explore the molecular networks in the context of health and disease. In this review article, we highlight recent advances in network biology approaches with an emphasis in brain-networks that have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms leading to the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's diseases (HD). We discuss how integrative approaches using multi-omics data from different tissues have been valuable for identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In addition, we discuss the challenges the field of network medicine faces toward the translation of network-based findings into clinically actionable tools for personalized medicine applications.

AB Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been linked to recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), renal scarring, hypertension, renal insufficiency and end-stage kidney disease. Different imaging strategies have been proposed to approach children presenting with UTI to sort out patients with significant VUR while minimizing patient morbidity, radiation exposure and financial burden. None of these imaging strategies is universally accepted. The"top-down approach" (TDA) aims at restricting the number of voiding cystourethrograms (VCUGs) and its associated morbidity while identifying patients with clinically-significant reflux. In this approach, children presenting with febrile UTIs are acutely investigated with dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scans to identify patients with renal parenchymal inflammation. Those with evidence of renal affection are offered VCUG and late DMSA scan to identify VUR and permanent renal scarring, respectively. Although TDA could identify clinically-significant VUR with high sensitivity, it is not without limitations. The approach segregates patients based on the presence of DMSA cortical lesions omitting the morbidity and the economic burden of UTI. Additionally, some of DMSA lesions are attributed to congenital dysplasia and unrelated to UTI. Ionizing radiation exposure, financial costs, limited availability of DMSA scans in the acute setting, variability in interpreting the results and low yield of actionable findings on DMSA scans are some other limitations. In this review, we tried to address the drawbacks of the TDA and reinforce the value of patient-centered approach for VUR.

AB A pressing question during the first half-decade of the third plague pandemic (1894-9) was what was a 'suitable soil' for the disease. The question related to plague's perceived ability to disappear from a given city only to reappear at some future point; a phenomenon that became central to scientific investigations of the disease. However, rather than this simply having a metaphorical meaning, the debate around plague's 'suitable soil' actually concerned the material reality of the soil itself. The prevalence of plague in the working-class neighbourhood of Taipingshan during the first major outbreak of the pandemic, in 1894 in Hong Kong, led to an extensive debate regarding the ability of the soil to harbour and even spread the disease. Involving experiments, which were seen as able to procure evidence for or against the demolition or even torching of the area, scientific and administrative concerns over the soil rendered it an unstable yet highly productive epistemic thing. The spread of plague to India further fuelled concerns over the ability of the soil to act as the medium of the disease's so-called true recrudescence. Besides high-profile scientific debates, hands-on experiments on purifying the soil of infected houses by means of highly intrusive methods allowed scientists and administrators to act upon and further solidify plague's supposed invisibility in the urban terrain. Rather than being a short-lived, moribund object of epidemiological concern, this paper will demonstrate that the soil played a crucial role in the development of plague as a scientifically knowable and actionable category for modern medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Single gene tests to predict whether cancers respond to specific targeted therapies are performed increasingly often. Advances in sequencing technology, collectively referred to as next generation sequencing (NGS), mean the entire cancer genome or parts of it can now be sequenced at speed with increased depth and sensitivity. However, translation of NGS into routine cancer care has been slow. Healthcare stakeholders are unclear about the clinical utility of NGS and are concerned it could be an expensive addition to cancer diagnostics, rather than an affordable alternative to single gene testing.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: We validated a 46-gene hotspot cancer panel assay allowing multiple gene testing from small diagnostic biopsies. From 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013, solid tumour samples (including non-small-cell lung carcinoma [NSCLC], colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma) were sequenced in the context of the UK National Health Service from 351 consecutively submitted prospective cases for which treating clinicians thought the patient had potential to benefit from more extensive genetic analysis. Following histological assessment, tumour-rich regions of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections underwent macrodissection, DNA extraction, NGS, and analysis using a pipeline centred on Torrent Suite software. With a median turnaround time of seven working days, an integrated clinical report was produced indicating the variants detected, including those with potential diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, or clinical trial entry implications. Accompanying phenotypic data were collected, and a detailed cost analysis of the panel compared with single gene testing was undertaken to assess affordability for routine patient care. Panel sequencing was successful for 97% (342/351) of tumour samples in the prospective cohort and showed 100% concordance with known mutations (detected using cobas assays). At least one mutation was identified in 87% (296/342) of tumours. A locally actionable mutation (i.e., available targeted treatment or clinical trial) was identified in 122/351 patients (35%). Forty patients received targeted treatment, in 22/40 (55%) cases solely due to use of the panel. Examination of published data on the potential efficacy of targeted therapies showed theoretically actionable mutations (i.e., mutations for which targeted treatment was potentially appropriate) in 66% (71/107) and 39% (41/105) of melanoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. At a cost of 339 (US$449) per patient, the panel was less expensive locally than performing more than two or three single gene tests. Study limitations include the use of FFPE samples, which do not always provide high-quality DNA, and the use of "real world" data: submission of cases for sequencing did not always follow clinical guidelines, meaning that when mutations were detected, patients were not always eligible for targeted treatments on clinical grounds.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that more extensive tumour sequencing can identify mutations that could improve clinical decision-making in routine cancer care, potentially improving patient outcomes, at an affordable level for healthcare providers.

AB The lack of standard tools and methodologies and the absence of a streamlined multimarker approval process have hindered the translation rate of new biomarkers into clinical practice for a variety of diseases afflicting humankind. Advanced novel technologies with superior analytical performance and reduced reagent costs, like the programmable bio-nano-chip system featured in this article, have potential to change the delivery of healthcare. This universal platform system has the capacity to digitize biology, resulting in a sensor modality with a capacity to learn. With well-planned device design, development, and distribution plans, there is an opportunity to translate benchtop discoveries in the genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and glycomics fields by transforming the information content of key biomarkers into actionable signatures that can empower physicians and patients for a better management of healthcare. While the process is complicated and will take some time, showcased here are three application areas for this flexible platform that combines biomarker content with minimally invasive or non-invasive sampling, such as brush biopsy for oral cancer risk assessment; serum, plasma, and small volumes of blood for the assessment of cardiac risk and wellness; and oral fluid sampling for drugs of abuse testing at the point of need.

AB Background: Due to decreasing cost, and increasing speed and precision, genomic sequencing in research is resulting in the generation of vast amounts of genetic data. The question of how to manage that information has been an area of significant debate. In particular, there has been much discussion around the issue of 'secondary findings' (SF)-findings unrelated to the research that have diagnostic significance.; Sources of data: The following includes ethical commentaries, guidelines and policies in respect to large-scale clinical genomics studies.; Areas of agreement: Research participant autonomy and their informed consent are paramount-policies around SF must be made clear and participants must have the choice as to which results they wish to receive, if any.; Areas of controversy: While many agree that clinically 'actionable' findings should be returned, some question whether they should be actively sought within a research protocol.; Growing points: SF present challenges to a growing field; diverse policies around their management have the potential to hinder collaboration and future research.; Areas timely for developing research: The impact of returning SF and accurate estimates of their clinical utility are needed to inform future protocol design. © The Author 2017.

AB Massive somatic mutations discovered by large cancer genome sequencing projects provide unprecedented opportunities in the development of precision oncology. However, deep understanding of functional consequences of somatic mutations and identifying actionable mutations and the related drug responses currently remain formidable challenges. Dysfunction of protein posttranslational modification plays critical roles in tumorigenesis and drug responses. In this study, we proposed a novel computational oncoproteomics approach, named kinome-wide network module for cancer pharmacogenomics (KNMPx), for identifying actionable mutations that rewired signaling networks and further characterized tumorigenesis and anticancer drug responses. Specifically, we integrated 746,631 missense mutations in 4,997 tumor samples across 16 major cancer types/subtypes from The Cancer Genome Atlas into over 170,000 carefully curated nonredundant phosphorylation sites covering 18,610 proteins. We found 47 mutated proteins (e.g., ERBB2, TP53, and CTNNB1) that had enriched missense mutations at their phosphorylation sites in pan-cancer analysis. In addition, tissue-specific kinase-substrate interaction modules altered by somatic mutations identified by KNMPx were significantly associated with patient survival. We further reported a kinome-wide landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions by incorporating somatic mutation-rewired signaling networks in 1,001 cancer cell lines via KNMPx. Interestingly, we found that cell lines could highly reproduce oncogenic phosphorylation site mutations identified in primary tumors, supporting the confidence in their associations with sensitivity/resistance of inhibitors targeting EGF, MAPK, PI3K, mTOR, and Wnt signaling pathways. In summary, our KNMPx approach is powerful for identifying oncogenic alterations via rewiring phosphorylation-related signaling networks and drug sensitivity/resistance in the era of precision oncology.

AB Defects in maintaining genome integrity are a hallmark of cancer. The DNA damage response kinase ATM is frequently mutated in human cancer, but the significance of these events to chemotherapeutic efficacy has not been examined deeply in whole organism models. Here we demonstrate that bi-allelic Atm deletion in mouse models of Kras-mutant lung adenocarcinoma does not affect cisplatin responses. In marked contrast, Atm-deficient tumors displayed an enhanced response to the topoisomerase-II poison etoposide. Moreover, Atm-deficient cells and tumors were sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. This actionable molecular addiction to functional PARP1 signaling was preserved in models that were proficient or deficient in p53, resembling standard or high-risk genetic constellations, respectively. Atm deficiency also markedly enhanced sensitivity to the ATR inhibitor VE-822. Taken together, our results provide a functional rationale to profile human tumors for disabling ATM mutations, particularly given their impact on PARP1 and ATR inhibitors.

AB AIM: There is increasing use of molecular technologies to guide cancer treatments, but few cost data are available. Our objective was to assess the costs of molecular-guided therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors alongside the Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment and Optimization (MOSCATO) trial.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 529 patients. The molecular diagnosis included seven steps from tumor biopsy to the multidisciplinary molecular tumor board. The cost of a complete molecular diagnosis was assessed by micro-costing. Direct costs incurred from enrollment until progression were assessed from the French National Health Insurance perspective.; RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 54 years (range: 3-82) and the mean follow-up period was 145 days (range: 1-707 days). A complete molecular diagnosis cost [euro ]2,396. There were 220 patients with an actionable target (42%), among whom 105 (20%) actually received a targeted therapy. The cost of molecular-guided therapy per patient was [euro ]31,269. The main cost drivers were anticancer drugs (54%) and hospitalizations (35%).; CONCLUSION: This prospective cost analysis showed that molecular diagnosis accounts for only 6% of the cost of molecular-guided therapy per patient. The costs of drugs and hospitalizations are the main cost drivers.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.

AB Importance: Bedside monitor alarms alert nurses to life-threatening physiologic changes among patients, but the response times of nurses are slow.; Objective: To identify factors associated with physiologic monitor alarm response time.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used 551 hours of video-recorded care administered by 38 nurses to 100 children in a children's hospital medical unit between July 22, 2014, and November 11, 2015.; Exposures: Patient, nurse, and alarm-level factors hypothesized to predict response time.; Main Outcomes and Measures: We used multivariable accelerated failure-time models stratified by each nurse and adjusted for clustering within patients to evaluate associations between exposures and response time to alarms that occurred while the nurse was outside the room.; Results: The study participants included 38 nurses, 100% (n=38) of whom were white and 92% (n=35) of whom were female, and 100 children, 51% (n=51) of whom were male. The race/ethnicity of the child participants was 45% (n=45) black or African American, 33% (n=33) white, 4% (n=4) Asian, and 18% (n=18) other. Of 11 745 alarms among 100 children, 50 (0.5%) were actionable. The adjusted median response time among nurses was 10.4 minutes (95% CI, 5.0-15.8) and varied based on the following variables: if the patient was on complex care service (5.3 minutes [95% CI, 1.4-9.3] vs 11.1 minutes [95% CI, 5.6-16.6] among general pediatrics patients), whether family members were absent from the patient's bedside (6.3 minutes [95% CI, 2.2-10.4] vs 11.7 minutes [95% CI, 5.9-17.4] when family present), whether a nurse had less than 1 year of experience (4.4 minutes [95% CI, 3.4-5.5] vs 8.8 minutes [95% CI, 7.2-10.5] for nurses with 1 or more years of experience), if there was a 1 to 1 nursing assignment (3.5 minutes [95% CI, 1.3-5.7] vs 10.6 minutes [95% CI, 5.3-16.0] for nurses caring for 2 or more patients), if there were prior alarms requiring intervention (5.5 minutes [95% CI, 1.5-9.5] vs 10.7 minutes [5.2-16.2] for patients without intervention), and if there was a lethal arrhythmia alarm (1.2 minutes [95% CI, -0.6 to 2.9] vs 10.4 minutes [95% CI, 5.1-15.8] for alarms for other conditions). Each hour that elapsed during a nurse's shift was associated with a 15% longer response time (6.1 minutes [95% CI, 2.8-9.3] in hour 2 vs 14.1 minutes [95% CI, 6.4-21.7] in hour 8). The number of nonactionable alarms to which the nurse was exposed in the preceding 120 minutes was not associated with response time.; Conclusions and Relevance: Response time was associated with factors that likely represent the heuristics nurses use to assess whether an alarm represents a life-threatening condition. The nurse to patient ratio and physical and mental fatigue (measured by the number of hours into a shift) represent modifiable factors associated with response time. Chronic alarm fatigue resulting from long-term exposure to nonactionable alarms may be a more important determinant of response time than short-term exposure.

AB Molecular profiling in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has allowed for the detection of actionable mutations, which has revolutionized the treatment paradigm in this highly fatal disease. Mutations involving the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are most common and the 'classical mutations', exon 19 deletions and the point mutation L858R at exon 21, predict response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The 'uncommon' EGFR mutations account for 10-18% of all EGFR mutations and primarily consist of exon 20 insertions, exon 18 point mutations and complex mutations. Improved detection techniques have broadened the spectrum of reported aberrations within the 'uncommon group' but response to TKIs is variable and not fully elucidated. This review provides an overview of the biology and incidence of uncommon EGFR mutations and summarizes reported outcomes when treated with EGFR-TKIs. Crown Copyright © 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Preprocedural assessments are used by anesthesia providers to optimize perioperative care for patients undergoing invasive procedures. When these assessments are performed in advance by providers who are not caring for the patient during the procedure, there is an additional layer of complexity in ensuring that the workup meets the needs of the primary anesthesia care team. In this study, anesthesia providers were asked to rate the quality of preprocedural assessments prepared by other providers to evaluate anesthesia care team satisfaction.; METHODS: Quality ratings for preprocedural assessments were collected from anesthesia providers on the day of surgery using an electronic quality assurance tool from January 9, 2014 to October 21, 2014. Users could rate assessments as "exemplary," "satisfactory," or "unsatisfactory." Free text comments could be entered for any of the quality ratings chosen. A reviewer trained in clinical anesthesia categorized all comments as "positive," "constructive," or "neutral" and conducted in-depth chart reviews triggered by 67 "constructive" comments submitted during the first 3 months of data collection to further subcategorize perceived deficiencies in the preprocedural assessments. In May 2014, providers were asked to participate in a midpoint survey and provide general feedback about the preprocedural process and evaluations.; RESULTS: 37,611 procedures requiring anesthesia were analyzed. Of the 17,522 (46.6%) cases with a rated preprocedural assessment, anesthesia providers rated 3828 (21.8%) as "exemplary," 13,454 (76.8%) as "satisfactory," and 240 (1.4%) as "unsatisfactory." The monthly proportion of "unsatisfactory" ratings ranged from 3.1% to 0% over the study period, whereas the midpoint survey showed that anesthesia providers estimated that the number of unsatisfactory evaluations was 11.5%. Preprocedural evaluations performed on inpatients received significantly better ratings than evaluations performed on outpatients by the preadmission testing clinic or phone program (P < .0001). The most common reason given for "unsatisfactory" ratings was a perception of "missing information" (49.2%). Chart reviews revealed that inadequate documentation was in reality the most common deficiency in preprocedural evaluations (35 of 67 reviews, 52.2%).; CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming majority of preprocedural assessments performed at our institution were considered satisfactory or exemplary by day-of-surgery anesthesia providers. This was demonstrated by both the case-by-case ratings and midpoint survey. However, the perceived frequency of "unsatisfactory" evaluations was worse when providers were asked to reflect on the quality of preprocedural evaluations generally versus rate them individually. Analysis of comments left by providers allowed us to identify specific and actionable areas for improvement. This method can be used by other institutions to identify systemic deficiencies in the preprocedural evaluation process.

AB Following initial characterization of the reference human genome, initiatives have evolved worldwide to identify genomic aberrations in cancer with the aim of deriving diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information. However, the functional and clinical relevance of many somatic variants in cancer are presently unknown and there is no consensus definition of 'actionability' for genomic aberrancies. Therefore, while robust detection of a variety of genetic aberrations in clinical specimens remains a technical hurdle, the greater challenge lies in the interpretation of these alterations. Critical evaluation of genomic variation in cancer requires the integration of available clinical and preclinical evidence related to their frequencies, functions and roles as therapeutic targets. Many publicly accessible data resources have compiled such evidence to facilitate the understanding of genomic results and ultimately translating results to clinical action. Information for these data resources is derived from various sources including large population genomic datasets, curation of published literature, and data sharing by the scientific community. Currently, there is no widely accepted guidance to definitively assess and integrate the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information of somatic variants using these knowledge databases. This review will describe data resources pertinent to the identification and interpretation of actionable genomic aberrations by clinicians, and highlight relevant issues in the clinical application of tumor molecular profiling results. © The Author 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: The detection of somatic mutations in primary tumors is critical for the understanding of cancer evolution and targeting therapy. Multiple technologies have been developed to enable the detection of such mutations. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a new platform that is gradually becoming the technology of choice for genotyping cancer samples, owing to its ability to simultaneously interrogate many genomic loci at massively high efficiency and increasingly lower cost. However, multiple barriers still exist for its broader adoption in clinical research practice, such as fragmented workflow and complex bioinformatics analysis and interpretation.; METHODS: We performed validation of the QIAGEN GeneReader NGS System using the QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel, focusing on clinically meaningful mutations by using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal tissue with known KRAS mutations. The performance of the GeneReader was evaluated and compared to data generated from alternative technologies (PCR and pyrosequencing) as well as an alternative NGS platform. The results were further confirmed with Sanger sequencing.; RESULTS: The data generated from the GeneReader achieved 100% concordance with reference technologies. Furthermore, the GeneReader workflow provides a truly integrated workflow, eliminating artifacts resulting from routine sample preparation; and providing up-to-date interpretation of test results.; CONCLUSION: The GeneReader NGS system offers an effective and efficient method to identify somatic (KRAS) cancer mutations.

AB BACKGROUND: The growing number of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) tests is transforming the routine clinical diagnosis of hereditary cancers. Identifying whether a cancer is the result of an underlying disease-causing mutation in a cancer predisposition gene is not only diagnostic for a cancer predisposition syndrome, but also has significant clinical implications in the clinical management of patients and their families.; METHODS: Here, we evaluated the performance of MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) in detecting genetic alterations in 76 genes implicated in cancer predisposition syndromes. Output from hybridization-based capture was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. A custom analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs).; RESULTS: MSK-IMPACT detected all germline variants in a set of 233 unique patient DNA samples, previously confirmed by previous single gene testing. Reproducibility of variant calls was demonstrated using inter- and intra- run replicates. Moreover, in 16 samples, we identified additional pathogenic mutations other than those previously identified through a traditional gene-by-gene approach, including founder mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and APC, and truncating mutations in TP53, TSC2, ATM and VHL.; CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of the NGS-based gene panel testing approach in comprehensively identifying germline variants contributing to cancer predisposition and simultaneous detection of somatic and germline alterations.

AB OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a commonly diagnosed bone malignancy in children and adolescents. Nuclear division cycle 80 (NDC80) is a crucial regulator of the cell division cycle that has recently been identified as a novel oncoprotein in various solid tumors; however, its role in OS remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between NDC80 expression in OS patients and clinicopathological features and prognosis.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We began this study by determining NDC80 expression in sarcoma patients using the Oncomine Platform. Then, we measured NDC80 mRNA expression by RT-PCR in 26-paired fresh OS and adjacent normal samples. Finally, we analyzed NDC80 expression by immunohistochemistry in a retrospective cohort of 154 OS patients.; RESULTS: NDC80 mRNA was abnormally overexpressed not only in OS, but also in other sarcomas including liposarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. In the retrospective analysis, NDC80 expression was significantly correlated with TNM stage (p=0.023) and distant metastasis (p=0.008). OS patients with high NDC80 expression had a significantly worse OS-specific (p=0.002) and disease-free survival (p=0.001) compared with those with low NDC80 expression. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that NDC80 expression together with TNM stage, distant metastasis and preoperative chemotherapy response are significant independent prognostic factors affecting OS-specific and disease-free survival (p<0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted a novel insight into the clinical significance of NDC80 expression in OS patients and suggested its potential as a clinically actionable biomarker for prognostic prediction and therapy decisions.

AB INTRODUCTION: The treatment of lung cancer has radically changed over the last few years. The discovery of druggable oncogenic alterations and the introduction of immunotherapy have provided lung cancer patients with the possibility of more efficient and less toxic therapeutic alternatives than chemotherapy. In the case of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), the treatment progress is slower than adenocarcinoma, for which several targeted agents have been already approved. The standard first-line therapy for LSCC, in most sites of the world, is platinum-based chemotherapy. After disease progression, these patients now have novel treatment options, including antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint blockade. Areas covered: We provide a summary of the recent novelties for the second-line therapy of LSCC, emphasizing on the results of the most important clinical trials that have led to regulatory approvals. Expert commentary: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic algorithm for LSCC patients. Other treatment options in the second-line setting include ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel and afatinib. However, we still lack biomarkers to predict which patients could respond better to each treatment. Despite the identification of several actionable molecular alterations, there are no approved targeted agents specific for advanced LSCC. Results from ongoing biomarker-driven studies are eagerly awaited to establish effective treatments for molecularly selected subgroups of patients.

AB Background: Engaging patients across the research trajectory supports research that is generalizable, high quality, timely and actionable. However, this approach comes with challenges and opportunities as investigators and engaged patient stakeholders encounter institutional policies around patient engagement, privacy and research participant protection.; Objective: To describe the resolution and impact of quandaries arising when patient stakeholders' values and preferences conflicted with institutional policies.; Methods: Case study from a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded trial.; Results: The first example focuses on the tension between the health care organization's requirements for background checks for all patient advisors and the funders' requirement to engage hard-to-reach populations. To create an environment of mutual trust and respect with patient stakeholders, the research team decided against imposing background checks. All 53 patient and parent advisors have served continuously for 2 years and meeting attendance exceeds 95%. The second example describes parent stakeholders' role in revising a letter informing patients about a privacy violation. Among 49 families affected by and informed about this violation, 35 (71%) agreed to participate. The third example focuses on how patient stakeholder preferences about study reminders conflict with the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules. While patient stakeholders strongly endorsed text message reminders, regulations and technology do not permit reminders with enough detail to ensure clarity. Although retention rates exceeded 90%, attendance at study appointments was below 75% and below 60% for minority and low socio-economic status families.; Conclusion: Patient engagement positively impacts research. Resolving conflicts between patient-engaged research and existing institutional policies and regulations would allow this impact to become fully realized. © The Author 2017.

AB Objective: To explore the success of community-based participatory research [CBPR] in engaging African American women to achieve health equity by elucidating community, trust, communication and impact. Recommendations helpful for researchers interested in engaging communities to achieve health equity in the USA are included.; Inroduction: African American women experience health disparities of multifactorial etiology and are underrepresented in research. CBPR is a collaborative approach that incorporates perspectives, which address the intricate determinants of health and has been reported as an effective means to address health disparities. Yet, the science of CBPR seems elusive to researchers in the medical field. The opportunity exists to better understand and expand the use of the principles of engagement, replication, and sustainability in engaging African American women in health research.; Methods: A variety of literature regarding engaging African American women in community-based participatory research was reviewed.; Results: CBPR focused on robust engagement of marginalized groups continues to be validated as a vital approach to the elimination of disparities and improved health for all, especially ethnic and racial minority populations. However, limited evidence of focused engagement of African American women was found. Making specific outreach to African American women must be a community and patient engagement priority to achieve health equity.; Conclusions: Continued research is needed which specifically focuses on building and sustaining engagement with African American women and their communities. This research can transform healthcare access, experiences and outcomes by yielding actionable information about what African American women need and want to promote wellness for themselves and their communities. © The Author 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: The role of tumor molecular profiling in directing targeted therapy utilization remains to be defined for pediatric tumors. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a sequencing and molecular biology tumor board (MBB) program, and its clinical impact on children with solid tumors.; PROCEDURE: We report on a single-center MBB experience of 60 pediatric patients with a poor prognosis or relapsed/refractory solid tumors screened between October 2014 and November 2015. Tumor molecular profiling was performed with panel-based next-generation sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization.; RESULTS: Mean age was 12 ± 5.7 years (range 0.1-21.5); main tumor types were high-grade gliomas (n = 14), rare sarcomas (n = 9), and neuroblastomas (n = 8). The indication was a poor prognosis tumor at diagnosis for 16 patients and relapsed (n = 26) or refractory disease (n = 18) for the remaining 44 patients. Molecular profiling was feasible in 58 patients. Twenty-three patients (40%) had a potentially actionable finding. Patients with high-grade gliomas had the highest number of targetable alterations (57%). Six of the 23 patients subsequently received a matched targeted therapy for a period ranging from 16 days to 11 months. The main reasons for not receiving targeted therapy were poor general condition (n = 5), pursuit of conventional therapy (n = 6), or lack of pediatric trial (n = 4).; CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric molecular profiling is feasible, with more than a third of patients being eligible to receive targeted therapy, yet only a small proportion were treated with these therapies. Analysis at diagnosis may be useful for children with very poor prognosis tumsors. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Patient-generated data can allow patients and providers to collaboratively develop accurate diagnoses and actionable treatment plans. Unfortunately, patients and providers often lack effective support to make use of such data. We examine patient-provider collaboration to interpret patient-generated data. We focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic illness in which particular foods can exacerbate symptoms. IBS management often requires patient-provider collaboration using a patient's food and symptom journal to identify the patient's triggers. We contribute interactive visualizations to support exploration of such journals, as well as an examination of patient-provider collaboration in interpreting the journals. Drawing upon individual and collaborative interviews with patients and providers, we find that collaborative review helps improve data comprehension and build mutual trust. We also find a desire to use tools like our interactive visualizations within and beyond clinic appointments. We discuss these findings and present guidance for the design of future tools.

AB Cutaneous melanoma (CM) and uveal melanoma (UM) derive from cutaneous and uveal melanocytes that share the same embryonic origin and display the same cellular function. However, the etiopathogenesis and biological behaviors of these melanomas are very different. CM and UM display distinct landscapes of genetic alterations and show different metastatic routes and tropisms. Hence, therapeutic improvements achieved in the last few years for the treatment of CM have failed to ameliorate the clinical outcomes of patients with UM. The scope of this review is to discuss the differences in tumorigenic processes (etiologic factors and genetic alterations) and tumor biology (gene expression and signaling pathways) between CM and UM. We develop hypotheses to explain these differences, which might provide important clues for research avenues and the identification of actionable vulnerabilities suitable for the development of new therapeutic strategies for metastatic UM. © 2017 Pandiani et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB In West Africa, social factors influence whether couples with unmet need for family planning act on birth-spacing desires. Tekponon Jikuagou is testing a social network-based intervention to reduce social barriers by diffusing new ideas. Individuals and groups judged socially influential by their communities provide entree to networks. A participatory social network mapping methodology was designed to identify these diffusion actors. Analysis of monitoring data, in-depth interviews, and evaluation reports assessed the methodology's acceptability to communities and staff and whether it produced valid, reliable data to identify influential individuals and groups who diffuse new ideas through their networks. Results indicated the methodology's acceptability. Communities were actively and equitably engaged. Staff appreciated its ability to yield timely, actionable information. The mapping methodology also provided valid and reliable information by enabling communities to identify highly connected and influential network actors. Consistent with social network theory, this methodology resulted in the selection of informal groups and individuals in both informal and formal positions. In-depth interview data suggest these actors were diffusing new ideas, further confirming their influence/connectivity. The participatory methodology generated insider knowledge of who has social influence, challenging commonly held assumptions. Collecting and displaying information fostered staff and community learning, laying groundwork for social change.

AB Highly processed diets eaten by postindustrial modern human populations coincide with higher frequencies of third molar impaction, malocclusion, and temporomandibular joint disorders that affect millions of people worldwide each year. Current treatments address symptoms, not causes, because the multifactorial etiologies of these three concerns mask which factors incline certain people to malocclusion, impaction, and/or joint issues. Deep scientific curiosity about the origins of jaws and dentitions continues to yield rich insights about the developmental genetic mechanisms that underpin healthy craniodental morphogenesis and integration. Mounting evidence from evolution and development (Evo-Devo) studies suggests that function is another mechanism important to healthy craniodental integration and fit. Starting as early as weaning, softer diets and thus lower bite forces appear to relax or disrupt integration of oral tissues, alter development and growth, and catalyze impaction, malocclusion, and jaw joint disorders. How developing oral tissues respond to bite forces remains poorly understood, but biomechanical feedback seems to alter balances of local bone resorption and deposition at the tooth-bone interface as well as affect tempos and amounts of facial outgrowth. Also, behavioral changes in jaw function and parafunction contribute to degeneration and pain in joint articular cartilages and masticatory muscles. The developmental genetic contribution to craniodental misfits and disorders is undeniable but still unclear; however, at present, human diet and jaw function remain important and much more actionable clinical targets. New Evo-Devo studies are needed to explain how function interfaces with craniodental phenotypic plasticity, variation, and evolvability to yield a spectrum of healthy and mismatched dentitions and jaws. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Biomarker testing is recommended for all patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. At a minimum, testing should include the mutations/fusions EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and the protein programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), because FDA-approved therapies are available for these alterations. Other actionable molecular findings include RET rearrangements, BRAFV600E mutations, and MET exon 14 alterations. If adequate testing was not performed at treatment initiation, molecular testing should be performed before administration of subsequent lines of therapy. In patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, when resistance develops, physicians should seek to identify the T790M mutation using plasma and tissue assays, because osimertinib therapy is available for this mutation.

AB High-quality genomic analysis is critical for personalized pharmacotherapy in patients with cancer. Tumor-specific genomic alterations can be identified in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patient blood samples and can complement biopsies for real-time molecular monitoring of treatment, detection of recurrence, and tracking resistance. cfDNA can be especially useful when tumor tissue is unavailable or insufficient for testing. For blood-based genomic profiling, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) have been successfully applied. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the first such "liquid biopsy" test for EGFR mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Such non-invasive methods allow for the identification of specific resistance mutations selected by treatment, such as EGFR T790M, in patients with NSCLC treated with gefitinib. Chromosomal aberration pattern analysis by low coverage whole genome sequencing is a more universal approach based on genomic instability. Gains and losses of chromosomal regions have been detected in plasma tumor-specific cfDNA as copy number aberrations and can be used to compute a genomic copy number instability (CNI) score of cfDNA. A specific CNI index obtained by massive parallel sequencing discriminated those patients with prostate cancer from both healthy controls and men with benign prostatic disease. Furthermore, androgen receptor gene aberrations in cfDNA were associated with therapeutic resistance in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Change in CNI score has been shown to serve as an early predictor of response to standard chemotherapy for various other cancer types (e.g. NSCLC, colorectal cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas). CNI scores have also been shown to predict therapeutic responses to immunotherapy. Serial genomic profiling can detect resistance mutations up to 16 weeks before radiographic progression. There is a potential for cost savings when ineffective use of expensive new anticancer drugs is avoided or halted. Challenges for routine implementation of liquid biopsy tests include the necessity of specialized personnel, instrumentation, and software, as well as further development of quality management (e.g. external quality control). Validation of blood-based tumor genomic profiling in additional multicenter outcome studies is necessary; however, cfDNA monitoring can provide clinically important actionable information for precision oncology approaches.

AB Melanoma of the skin is a common cancer only in Europeans, whereas it arises in internal body surfaces (mucosal sites) and on the hands and feet (acral sites) in people throughout the world. Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences was similar to that affected by recurrent mutations to coding sequences. Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF1 in acral melanoma and SF3B1 in mucosal melanoma. Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however, neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes, some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the non-coding genome in its pathogenesis.

AB BACKGROUND: Solid tumors residing in tissues and organs leave footprints in circulation through circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNA). Characterization of the ctDNA portraits and comparison with tumor DNA mutational portraits may reveal clinically actionable information on solid tumors that is traditionally achieved through more invasive approaches.; METHODS: We isolated ctDNAs from plasma of patients of 103 lung cancer and 74 other solid tumors of different tissue origins. Deep sequencing using the Guardant360 test was performed to identify mutations in 73 clinically actionable genes, and the results were associated with clinical characteristics of the patient. The mutation profiles of 37 lung cancer cases with paired ctDNA and tumor genomic DNA sequencing were used to evaluate clonal representation of tumor in circulation. Five lung cancer cases with longitudinal ctDNA sampling were monitored for cancer progression or response to treatments.; RESULTS: Mutations in TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are most prevalent in our cohort. Mutation rates of ctDNA are similar in early (I and II) and late stage (III and IV) cancers. Mutation in DNA repair genes BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM are found in 18.1% (32/177) of cases. Patients with higher mutation rates had significantly higher mortality rates. Lung cancer of never smokers exhibited significantly higher ctDNA mutation rates as well as higher EGFR and ERBB2 mutations than ever smokers. Comparative analysis of ctDNA and tumor DNA mutation data from the same patients showed that key driver mutations could be detected in plasma even when they were present at a minor clonal population in the tumor. Mutations of key genes found in the tumor tissue could remain in circulation even after frontline radiotherapy and chemotherapy suggesting these mutations represented resistance mechanisms. Longitudinal sampling of five lung cancer cases showed distinct changes in ctDNA mutation portraits that are consistent with cancer progression or response to EGFR drug treatment.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ctDNA mutation rates in the key tumor-associated genes are clinical parameters relevant to smoking status and mortality. Mutations in ctDNA may serve as an early detection tool for cancer. This study quantitatively confirms the hypothesis that ctDNAs in circulation is the result of dissemination of aggressive tumor clones and survival of resistant clones. This study supports the use of ctDNA profiling as a less-invasive approach to monitor cancer progression and selection of appropriate drugs during cancer evolution.

AB BACKGROUND: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has made genomic mutation-driven therapy feasible for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. We frequently submit tumor tissue from MBC patients for targeted NGS of tumor using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, MA). Herein, we report the results and clinical impact of this test in MBC patients.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with MBC treated at City of Hope from January 2014 to May 2016 who underwent NGS. Patients' clinical characteristics, response to treatment (clinical assessment of tumor regression), and genomic mutation profiles were reviewed.; RESULTS: Forty-four patients with MBC underwent NGS: 24 triple negative breast cancer, 16 estrogen receptor positive, and 4 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive patients. Twenty-three patients received more than three lines of chemotherapy prior to NGS. Actionable mutations (potentially responsive to targeted therapies that are on the market or in registered clinical trials) were identified in almost all patients (42/44; 95%) and over half of these 42 patients with actionable mutations (23/42; 55%) initiated mutation-driven targeted therapies. Of these 23 patients, 16/23 (70%) had assessable responses, and 7/23 (30%) were not assessable for response due to short exposure (<2 weeks) or hospice transition. The remaining 19/42 (45%) patients did not initiate targeted therapy.; CONCLUSION: NGS can identify effective targeted therapy options for MBC patients based on actionable mutations that were not previously offered based on pathology type. NGS should be performed early in patients with good performance status and preferably in clinical settings where genomic mutation-driven therapeutic trials are available.

AB Deficiencies in DNA repair due to mutations in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase ɛ have recently been described in a subset of cancers characterized by an ultramutated and microsatellite stable (MSS) phenotype. This alteration in DNA repair is distinct from the better-known mismatch repair deficiencies which lead to microsatellite instability (MSI) and an increased tumor mutation burden. Instead, mutations in POLE lead to impaired proofreading intrinsic to Pol ɛ during DNA replication resulting in a dramatically increased mutation rate. Somatic mutations of Pol ɛ have been found most frequently in endometrial and colorectal cancers (CRC) and can lead to a unique familial syndrome in the case of germline mutations. While other key genomic abnormalities, such as MSI, have known prognostic and treatment implications, in this case it is less clear. As molecular genotyping of tumors becomes routine in the care of cancer patients, less common, but potentially actionable findings such as these POLE mutations could be overlooked unless appropriate algorithms are in place. We present two cases of metastatic CRC with a POLE mutation, both of which are ultramutated and MSS. The basic biochemical mechanisms leading to a unique phenotype in POLE deficiency as well as challenges faced with interpreting the genomic profiling of tumors in this important subset of patients and the potential clinical implications will be discussed here. The Oncologist 2017;22:497-502 KEY POINTS: Clinicians should recognize that tumors with high tumor mutation burden and that are microsatellite stable may harbor a POLE mutation, which is associated with an ultramutated phenotype.Work-up for POLE deficiency should indeed become part of the routine molecular testing paradigm for patients with colorectal cancer.This subset of patients may benefit from clinical trials where the higher number of mutation-associated neoantigens and defect in DNA repair may be exploited therapeutically. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB Viewing health care from a systems perspective-that is, "a collection of different things which, working together, produce a result not achievable by the things alone"-raises awareness of the complex interrelationships involved in meeting society's goals for accessible, cost-effective, high-quality health care. This perspective also emphasizes the far-reaching consequences of changes in one sector of a system on other components' performance. Medical education promotes this holistic view of health care in its curricula and competency requirements for graduation at the undergraduate and graduate training levels. But how completely does medical education apply a systems lens to itself?The continuum of medical training has undergone a series of changes that have moved it more closely to a systems organizational model. Competency assessment criteria have been expanded and more explicitly defined for learners at all levels of training. Outcomes data, in multiple domains, are monitored by external reviewers for program accreditation. However, translating increasing amounts of individual outcomes into actionable intelligence for decision making poses a formidable information management challenge.Assessment in systems is designed to impart a "big picture" of overall system performance through the synthesis, analysis, and interpretation of outcomes data to provide actionable information for continuous systems improvement, innovation, and long-term planning. A systems-based framework is presented for use across the medical education continuum to facilitate timely improvements in individual curriculum components, continuous improvement in overall program performance, and program decision making on changes required to better address society's health care needs.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: The advent of multiple-gene germline panel testing has led to significant advances in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment. These include guideline-specific cancer risk management recommendations for patients and their families, such as screening with breast magnetic resonance imaging and risk-reducing surgeries, which have the potential to reduce substantially the morbidity and mortality associated with a hereditary cancer predisposition. However, controversy remains about the clinical validity and actionability of genetic testing in a broader patient population. We discuss events leading to the wider availability of commercialized multiple-gene germline panel testing, the recent data that support using this powerful tool to improve cancer risk assessment and reduction strategies, and remaining challenges to clinical optimization of this new genetic technology.

AB Clinical trials are essential for developing new and effective treatments and improving patient quality of life; however, many trials cannot answer their primary research questions because they fall short of their recruitment goals. This article reports the results of formative research conducted in two populations, the public and primary care physicians, to identify messages that may raise awareness and increase interest in clinical trials and be used in a national communication campaign. Results suggested that participants were primarily motivated to participate in clinical trials out of a self-interest to help themselves first. Messages illustrated that current treatments were tested via clinical trials, helped normalize trials as routine practices, and reduced concerns over trying something new first. Participants wanted messages that portray trials as state-of-the-art choices that offer some hope, show people like themselves, and are described in a clear, concise manner with actionable steps for them to take. The study revealed some differences in message salience, with healthy audiences exhibiting lower levels of interest. Our results suggest that targeted messages are needed, and that communication with primary health-care providers is an important and necessary component in raising patient awareness of the importance of clinical trials.

AB Next-generation sequencing is increasingly used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of Mendelian diseases. Because of the high likelihood of secondary findings associated with this technique, the process of informing patients is beset with new challenges. One of them is regarding the type of secondary findings that ought to be disclosed to patients. The aim of this research is to propose a practical implementation of the notion of actionability, a common criteria justifying the disclosure of secondary findings but whose interpretation varies greatly among professionals. We distinguish three types of actionability corresponding to (1) well-established medical actions, (2) patient-initiated health-related actions and (3) life-plan decisions. We argue that actionability depends on the characteristics of the mutation or gene and on the values of patients. In discussing the return of secondary findings, it is important that the physician tries to get an impression of the specific situation and values of patients. Regarding variants of uncertain clinical significance in actionable genes, we found that different understandings of autonomy lead to different conclusions and that, for some of them, it may be legitimate to refrain from returning uncertain information.

AB PURPOSE: This study aimed to study whether cancer cells possess distinguishing metabolic features compared with surrounding normal cells, such as increased glutamine uptake. Given this, quantitative measures of glutamine uptake may reflect critical processes in oncology. Approximately, 10% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) express BRAF V600E , which may be actionable with selective BRAF inhibitors or in combination with inhibitors of complementary signaling axes. Non-invasive and quantitative predictive measures of response to these targeted therapies remain poorly developed in this setting. The primary objective of this study was to explore 4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (4-[18F]F-GLN) positron emission tomography (PET) to predict response to BRAFV600E-targeted therapy in preclinical models of colon cancer.; PROCEDURES: Tumor microarrays from patients with primary human colon cancers (n=115) and CRC liver metastases (n=111) were used to evaluate the prevalence of ASCT2, the primary glutamine transporter in oncology, by immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, 4-[18F]F-GLN PET was evaluated in mouse models of human BRAF V600E -expressing and BRAF wild-type CRC.; RESULTS: Approximately 70% of primary colon cancers and 53% of metastases exhibited positive ASCT2 immunoreactivity, suggesting that [18F]4-F-GLN PET could be applicable to a majority of patients with colon cancer. ASCT2 expression was not associated selectively with the expression of mutant BRAF. Decreased 4-[18F]F-GLN predicted pharmacological response to single-agent BRAF and combination BRAF and PI3K/mTOR inhibition in BRAF V600E -mutant Colo-205 tumors. In contrast, a similar decrease was not observed in BRAF wild-type HCT-116 tumors, a setting where BRAFV600E-targeted therapies are ineffective.; CONCLUSIONS: 4-[18F]F-GLN PET selectively reflected pharmacodynamic response to BRAF inhibition when compared with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose PET, which was decreased non-specifically for all treated cohorts, regardless of downstream pathway inhibition. These findings illustrate the utility of non-invasive PET imaging measures of glutamine uptake to selectively predict response to BRAF-targeted therapy in colon cancer and may suggest further opportunities to inform colon cancer clinical trials using targeted therapies against MAPK activation.

AB Resistance to therapeutic antibodies in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is common. In this study, we show that therapeutic antibodies against CD62L (CD62L-Ab) or CD20 (obinutuzumab) were able to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADP) in primary cultures of CLL cells. CLL cells derived from patients with active disease requiring treatment displayed resistance to these antibodies, whereas patients with stable disease were sensitive. Using enrichment strategies and transcriptomic analyses, we show that antibody-dependent tumour cell killing was FcgammaR-dependent and mediated by macrophages. Moreover, we show that resistance cannot be attributed to total numbers or established subtypes of monocytes/macrophages, or the efficiency with which they bind an immune complex. Rather, ADCC/ADP resistance was due to reduced signalling activity through the activating FcgammaRs resulting in the transfer of dominance to the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb within macrophages. Most significantly, we show that resistance is an actionable event that could be reversed using inhibitors of FcgammaRIIb signalling in primary cultures of CLL cells that were previously insensitive to obinutuzumab or CD62L-Ab.

AB Nearly 80% of cancer patients do not have genetic mutation results available at initial oncology consultation; up to 25% of patients begin treatment before receiving their results. These factors hinder the ability to pursue optimal treatment strategies. This study validates a blood-based genome-testing service that provides accurate results within 72 hours. We focused on targetable variants in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma-epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) variant L858R, exon 19 deletion(DeltaE746-A750), and T790M; GTPase Kirsten ras gene (KRAS) variants G12C/D/V; and echinodermmicrotubule associated protein like and 4 anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase fusion (EML4-ALK) transcripts 1/2/3. Test development included method and clinical validation using samples from donors with (n=219) or without (n=30) cancer. Clinical sensitivity and specificity for each variantranged from78.6% to 100% and 94.2% to 100%, respectively. We also report on 1643 non-small cell lung carcinoma samples processed in our CLIA-certified laboratory. Mutation results were available within 72hours for 94% of the tests evaluated. We detected 10.5% mutations for EGFR sensitizing (n=2801 samples tested), 13.8% mutations for EGFR resistance (n=1055), 13.2% mutations in KRAS (n=3477), and 2% mutations for EML4-ALK fusion (n=304). This rapid, highly sensitive, and actionable blood-based assay service expands testing options and supports faster treatment decisions.

AB Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), an epithelial malignancy affecting a variety of subsites in the oral cavity, is prevalent in Asia. The survival rate of OSCC patients has not improved over the past decades due to its heterogeneous etiology, genetic aberrations, and treatment outcomes. Improvement in therapeutic strategies and tailored treatment options is an unmet need. To unveil the mutational spectrum, whole-exome sequencing of 120 OSCC from male individuals in Taiwan was conducted. Analyzing the contributions of the five mutational signatures extracted from the dataset of somatic variations identified four groups of tumors that were significantly associated with demographic and clinical features. In addition, known (TP53, FAT1, EPHA2, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, CASP8, HRAS, RASA1, and PIK3CA) and novel (CHUK and ELAVL1) genes that were significantly and frequently mutated in OSCC were discovered. Further analyses of gene alteration status with clinical parameters revealed that the tumors of the tongue were enriched with copy-number alterations in several gene clusters containing CCND1 and MAP4K2. Through defining the catalog of targetable genomic alterations, 58% of the tumors were found to carry at least one aberrant event potentially targeted by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents. Strikingly, if targeting the p53-cell cycle pathway (TP53 and CCND1) by the drugs studied in phase I-III clinical trials, those possibly actionable tumors are predominantly located in the tongue, suggesting a better prediction of sensitivity to current targeted therapies. Our work revealed molecular OSCC subgroups that reflect etiological and prognostic correlation as well as defined the landscape of major altered events in the coding regions of OSCC genomes. These findings provide clues for the design of clinical trials for targeted therapies and stratification of OSCC patients with differential therapeutic efficacy.

AB AIM: Determine the ability of a pharmacogenetic service, PRIMER, to identify drug-gene (DGI) and drug-drug interactions (DDI) in patients across multiple conditions. PRIMER consists of patient selection criteria, a gene panel and actionable guidance for DGIs and DDIs.; RESULTS: The average patient was prescribed 12 medications. PRIMER identified significant DGIs in 73% of patients tested, with 43% having more than one DGI. DDIs were found in 87% of patients. The most common actionable DGIs were for opioid, psychotropic and cardiovascular medications.; CONCLUSION: The pairing of patient selection criteria, a multigene panel with evidence-based interpretation and review of DDIs maximizes the patients tested who have actionable benefit and alerts physicians to potentially critical adjustments needed for the patient's medication regimen.

AB Translating in vitro biological data into actionable information related to human health holds the potential to improve disease treatment and risk assessment of chemical exposures. While genomics has identified regulatory pathways at the cellular level, translation to the organism level requires a multiscale approach accounting for intra-cellular regulation, inter-cellular interaction, and tissue/organ-level effects. Tissue-level effects can now be probed in vitro thanks to recently developed systems of three-dimensional (3D), multicellular, "organotypic" cell cultures, which mimic functional responses of living tissue. However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding interactions across different biological scales, complicating accurate prediction of health outcomes from molecular/genomic data and tissue responses. Systems biology aims at mathematical modeling of complex, non-linear biological systems. We propose to apply a systems biology approach to achieve a computational representation of tissue-level physiological responses by integrating empirical data derived from organotypic culture systems with computational models of intracellular pathways to better predict human responses. Successful implementation of this integrated approach will provide a powerful tool for faster, more accurate and cost-effective screening of potential toxicants and therapeutics. On September 11, 2015, an interdisciplinary group of scientists, engineers, and clinicians gathered for a workshop in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to discuss this ambitious goal. Participants represented laboratory-based and computational modeling approaches to pharmacology and toxicology, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, government, non-profits, and academia. Discussions focused on identifying critical system perturbations to model, the computational tools required, and the experimental approaches best suited to generating key data.

AB Background: Sinonasal carcinomas (SNCs) comprise various rare tumor types that are characterized by marked histologic diversity and largely unknown molecular profiles, yet share an overall poor prognosis owing to an aggressive clinical course and frequent late-stage diagnosis. The lack of effective systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic SNC poses a major challenge to therapeutic decision making for individual patients. We here aimed to identify actionable genetic alterations in a patient with metastatic SNC whose tumor, despite all diagnostic efforts, could not be assigned to any known SNC category and was refractory to multimodal therapy.; Patients and methods: We used whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing to identify a KIT exon 11 mutation (c.1733_1735del, p.D579del) as potentially druggable target in this patient and carried out cancer hotspot panel sequencing to detect secondary resistance-conferring mutations in KIT. Furthermore, as a step towards clinical exploitation of the recently described signatures of mutational processes in cancer genomes, we established and applied a novel bioinformatics algorithm that enables supervised analysis of the mutational catalogs of individual tumors.; Results: Molecularly guided treatment with imatinib in analogy to the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) resulted in a dramatic and durable response with remission of nearly all tumor manifestations, indicating a dominant driver function of mutant KIT in this tumor. KIT dependency was further validated by a secondary KIT exon 17 mutation (c.2459_2462delATTCinsG, p.D820_S821delinsG) that was detected upon tumor progression after 10 months of imatinib treatment and provided a rationale for salvage therapy with regorafenib, which has activity against KIT exon 11/17 mutant GIST.; Conclusions: These observations highlight the potential of unbiased genomic profiling for uncovering the vulnerabilities of individual malignancies, particularly in rare and unclassifiable tumors, and underscore that KIT exon 11 mutations represent tractable therapeutic targets across different histologies. © The Author 2016.

AB Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths across the world. In this study, we present therapeutically relevant genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma of Indian origin.; Materials and methods: Forty-five primary lung adenocarcinoma tumors were sequenced for 676 amplicons using RainDance cancer panel at an average coverage of 1500*(reads per million mapped reads). To validate the findings, 49 mutations across 23 genes were genotyped in an additional set of 363 primary lung adenocarcinoma tumors using mass spectrometry. NIH/3T3 cells over expressing mutant and wild-type FGFR3 constructs were characterized for anchorage independent growth, constitutive activation, tumor formation and sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors using in vitro and xenograft mouse models.; Results: We present the first spectrum of actionable alterations in lung adenocarcinoma tumors of Indian origin, and shows that mutations of FGFR3 are present in 20 of 363 (5.5%) patients. These FGFR3 mutations are constitutively active and oncogenic when ectopically expressed in NIH/3T3 cells and using a xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice. Inhibition of FGFR3 kinase activity inhibits transformation of NIH/3T3 overexpressing FGFR3 constructs and growth of tumors driven by FGFR3 in the xenograft models. The reduction in tumor size in the mouse is paralleled by a reduction in the amounts of phospho-ERK, validating the in vitro findings. Interestingly, the FGFR3 mutations are significantly higher in a proportion of younger patients and show a trend toward better overall survival, compared with patients lacking actionable alterations or those harboring KRAS mutations.; Conclusion: We present the first actionable mutation spectrum in Indian lung cancer genome. These findings implicate FGFR3 as a novel therapeutic in lung adenocarcinoma. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.

AB Background: We sought to identify genomic alterations (GAs) in salivary mucoepidermoid carcinomas.; Patients and methods: DNA was extracted from 48 mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) including the calculation to tumor mutational burden (TMB) was performed on hybridization-captured adaptor ligation-based libraries of 315 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged for cancer and evaluated for all classes of GAs.; Results: A total of 183 GAs were found in 80 unique genes. High-grade tumors had more GAs (mean 5±3.8) compared with low (2.3±1.4) or intermediate (2.6±1.5) (P=0.019). TP53 GAs were seen in all tumor grades (41.7%) but were most common in high-grade malignancies (56%) (P=0.047). CDKN2A GAs were seen in 41.6% of tumors. PI3K/mTOR pathway activation, including PI3KCA mutations, were more common in high grade (52%) than in low- and intermediate-grade tumors (4.3%) (P=0.007). BAP1 GAs were observed in 20.8% of tumors and BRCA1/2 GAs present in 10.5% of specimens. ERBB2 amplifications were seen in only 8.3% of tumors. The TMB for this patient group was relatively low with only 5 (10%) of cases having greater than 10 mutations/megabase of sequenced DNA.; Conclusion: CGP of salivary mucoepidermoid carcinomas revealed diverse GAs that may lead to customized treatment options for patients with these rare tumors. © The Author 2017.

AB We present an updated account of breast cancer treatment and of progress toward "precision" cancer therapy; we focus on new developments in diagnostic molecular pathology and breast cancer that have emerged during the past 2 years. Increasing awareness of new prognostic and predictive methodologies, and introduction of next generation sequencing has increased understanding of both tumor biology and clinical behavior, which offers the possibility of more appropriate therapeutic choices. It remains unclear which of these testing methodologies provides the most informative and cost-effective actionable results for predictive and prognostic pathology. It is likely, however, that an integrated "step-wise" approach that uses the traditional clinical-pathologic paradigms coordinated with molecular characterization of breast tumor tissue, will offer the most comprehensive and cost-effective options for individualized, "precision" therapy for patients with breast cancer.

AB HER2/ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancers targeted effectively by the small-molecule kinase inhibitor lapatinib frequently acquire resistance to this drug. In this study, we employed explorative mass spectrometry to profile proteome, kinome, and phosphoproteome changes in an established model of lapatinib resistance to systematically investigate initial inhibitor response and subsequent reprogramming in resistance. The resulting dataset, which collectively contains quantitative data for >7,800 proteins, >300 protein kinases, and >15,000 phosphopeptides, enabled deep insight into signaling recovery and molecular reprogramming upon resistance. Our data-driven approach confirmed previously described mechanisms of resistance (e.g., AXL overexpression and PIK3 reactivation), revealed novel pharmacologically actionable targets, and confirmed the expectation of significant heterogeneity in molecular resistance drivers inducing distinct phenotypic changes. Furthermore, our approach identified an extensive and exclusively phosphorylation-mediated reprogramming of glycolytic activity, supported additionally by widespread changes of corresponding metabolites and an increased sensitivity towards glycolysis inhibition. Collectively, our multi-omic analysis offers deeper perspectives on cancer drug resistance and suggests new biomarkers and treatment options for lapatinib-resistant cancers.

AB Purpose: Aberrations in genetic sequences encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor RET lead to oncogenic signaling that is targetable with anti-RET multikinase inhibitors. Understanding the comprehensive genomic landscape of RET aberrations across multiple cancers may facilitate clinical trial development targeting RETExperimental Design: We interrogated the molecular portfolio of 4,871 patients with diverse malignancies for the presence of RET aberrations using Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified targeted next-generation sequencing of 182 or 236 gene panels.Results: Among diverse cancers, RET aberrations were identified in 88 cases [1.8% (88/4, 871)], with mutations being the most common alteration [38.6% (34/88)], followed by fusions [30.7% (27/88), including a novel SQSTM1-RET] and amplifications [25% (22/88)]. Most patients had coexisting aberrations in addition to RET anomalies [81.8% (72/88)], with the most common being in TP53-associated genes [59.1% (52/88)], cell cycle-associated genes [39.8% (35/88)], the PI3K signaling pathway [30.7% (27/88)], MAPK effectors [22.7% (20/88)], or other tyrosine kinase families [21.6% (19/88)]. RET fusions were mutually exclusive with MAPK signaling pathway alterations. All 72 patients harboring coaberrations had distinct genomic portfolios, and most [98.6% (71/72)] had potentially targetable coaberrations with either an FDA-approved or an investigational agent. Two cases with lung (KIF5B-RET) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (RET M918T) that responded to a vandetanib (multikinase RET inhibitor)-containing regimen are shown.Conclusions:RET aberrations were seen in 1.8% of diverse cancers, with most cases harboring actionable, albeit distinct, coexisting alterations. The current report suggests that optimal targeting of patients with RET anomalies will require customized combination strategies.

AB Brain metastases (BM) continue to represent an unmet clinical need in oncology. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy hold great promise in the treatment of BM. Emerging data are confirming the activity of these agents in patients with BM. Genomic studies have confirmed that clinically actionable mutations are present in BM and they can be used in clinical studies to link targeted therapies with their genetic targets. Furthermore, as molecular signatures associated with sensitivity and resistance to immunotherapies are developed, we will better be able to select BM patients who will most benefit from these therapies. Understanding the genetic and immune evolution within BM should drive the next generation of immunotherapy and target therapy, as well as increase the accuracy of the selection process for these therapies.

AB Aims: To assess whether radial compared with femoral access is associated with consistent outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).; Methods and results: In the Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by TRansradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of angioX (MATRIX) programme patients were randomized to radial or femoral access, stratified by STEMI (2001 radial, 2009 femoral) and NSTE-ACS (2196 radial, 2198 femoral). The 30-day co-primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and net adverse clinical events (NACE), defined as MACE or major bleeding In the overall study population, radial access reduced the NACE but not MACE endpoint at the prespecified 0.025 alpha. MACE occurred in 121 (6.1%) STEMI patients with radial access vs. 126 (6.3%) patients with femoral access [rate ratio (RR) = 0.96, 95% CI=0.75-1.24; P = 0.76] and in 248 (11.3%) NSTE-ACS patients with radial access vs. 303 (13.9%) with femoral access (RR=0.80, 95% CI=0.67-0.96; P = 0.016) (Pint = 0.25). NACE occurred in 142 (7.2%) STEMI patients with radial access and in 165 (8.3%) patients with femoral access (RR=0.86, 95% CI=0.68-1.08; P = 0.18) and in 268 (12.2%) NSTE-ACS patients with radial access compared with 321 (14.7%) with femoral access (RR=0.82, 95% CI=0.69-0.97; P = 0.023) (Pint = 0.76). All-cause mortality and access site-actionable bleeding favoured radial access irrespective of ACS type (Pint = 0.11 and Pint = 0.36, respectively).; Conclusion: Radial as compared with femoral access provided consistent benefit across the whole spectrum of patients with ACS, without evidence that type of presenting syndrome affected the results of the random access allocation.

AB Throughout the world, biomedical knowledge is routinely generated and shared through primary and secondary scientific publications. However, there is too much latency between publication of knowledge and its routine use in practice. To address this latency, what is actionable in scientific publications can be encoded to make it computable. We have created a purpose-built digital library platform to hold, manage, and share actionable, computable knowledge for health called the Knowledge Grid Library. Here we present it with its system architecture.

AB BACKGROUND: Obtaining routine radiographs in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after primary uncomplicated partial knee arthroplasty (PKA) is a common practice with unclear utility. The objective of this study is to determine the rate at which immediate postoperative radiographs identify an actionable problem after primary uncomplicated PKA and to determine the potential cost savings associated with foregoing the routine acquisition of these radiographs.; METHODS: This was a retrospective review that assessed a consecutive series of 1366 primary uncomplicated PKAs (including 873 unicondylar knee arthroplasties, 313 patellofemoral arthroplasties, and 180 bicompartmental knee arthroplasties) performed between January 2008 and March 2016. Patients were separated into 2 cohorts: (1) those who had PACU radiographs (n= 1184), and (2) those who did not (n=182). Operative reports and clinical follow-up records at the initial postoperative visit were reviewed to determine whether patients underwent early reoperation based on radiographic findings. The direct cost of PACU radiographs was estimated to be $33.63 based on average global Medicare payments from our institution.; RESULTS: The rate of reoperation because of radiographic findings in the PACU or at the first follow-up was 0% (95% confidence interval: 0.0%-0.027%). The estimated direct radiographic expenditure for our 1366 patient cohort was nearly $46,000.; CONCLUSION: Routine immediate postoperative PACU radiographs after primary uncomplicated PKA have limited clinical utility. Therefore, delaying postoperative radiographs until the initial follow-up office visit would result in substantial cost-savings without compromising the quality of patient care.

AB Despite advances in molecular characterization and lung cancer treatment in recent years, treatment options for patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC) remain limited as actionable mutations are rarely detected in this subtype. This article reviews potential molecular targets and associated novel agents for the treatment of advanced SCC in the era of personalized medicine. Elements of various pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor, PI3KCA, fibroblast growth factor receptor, retinoblastoma, cyclin-dependent kinases, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2, and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition may play pivotal roles in the development of SCC and are under investigation for drug development.

AB BACKGROUND: Social network research has become central to studies of health and aging. Its results may yield public health insights that are actionable and improve the quality of life of older adults. However, little is known about the social networks of older immigrant adults, whose social relationships often develop in the context of migration, compounded by cultural and linguistic barriers.; OBJECTIVES: This report aims to describe the structure, composition, and emotional components of social networks in the Chinese aging population of the USA, and to explore ways in which their social networks may be critical to their health decision-making.; METHODS: Our data come from the PINE study, a population-based epidemiological study of community-dwelling older Chinese American adults, aged 60 years and above, in the greater Chicago area. We conducted individual interviews in participants' homes from 2011 until 2013. Based on sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, this study computed descriptive statistics and trend tests for the social network measures adapted from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project study.; RESULTS: The findings show that older Chinese adults have a relatively small social network in comparison with their counterparts from other ethnic and racial backgrounds. Only 29.6% of the participants could name 5 close network members, and 2.2% could name 0 members. Their network composition was more heavily kin oriented (95.0%). Relationships with network members differed according to the older adults' sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Subgroup variations included the likelihood of discussing health-related issues with network members.; CONCLUSION: This study highlights the dynamic nature of social networks in later-life Chinese immigrants. For healthcare practitioners, developing cost-effective strategies that can mobilize social network support remains a critical undertaking in health intervention. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the causal impact of social networks on various domains of health. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB On October 5, 1981, Fortune magazine published a cover article entitled the "Next Industrial Revolution: Designing Drugs by Computer at Merck". With a 40+ year investment, we have been in the drug design business longer than most. During its history, the Merck drug design group has had several names, but it has always been in the "design" business, with the ultimate goal to provide an actionable hypothesis that could be tested experimentally. Often the result was a small molecule but it could just as easily be a peptide, biologic, predictive model, reaction, process, etc. To this end, the concept of design is now front and center in all aspects of discovery, safety assessment and early clinical development. At present, the Merck design group includes computational chemistry, protein structure determination, and cheminformatics. By bringing these groups together under one umbrella, we were able to align activities and capabilities across multiple research sites and departments. This alignment from 2010 to 2016 resulted in an 80% expansion in the size of the department, reflecting the increase in impact due to a significant emphasis across the organization to "design first" along the entire drug discovery path from lead identification (LID) to first in human (FIH) dosing. One of the major advantages of this alignment has been the ability to access all of the data and create an adaptive approach to the overall LID to FIH pathway for any modality, significantly increasing the quality of candidates and their probability of success. In this perspective, we will discuss how we crafted a new strategy, defined the appropriate phenotype for group members, developed the right skillsets, and identified metrics for success in order to drive continuous improvement. We will not focus on the tactical implementation, only giving specific examples as appropriate.

AB Sensitivity of short read DNA-sequencing for gene fusion detection is improving, but is hampered by the significant amount of noise composed of uninteresting or false positive hits in the data. In this paper we describe a tiered prioritisation approach to extract high impact gene fusion events from existing structural variant calls. Using cell line and patient DNA sequence data we improve the annotation and interpretation of structural variant calls to best highlight likely cancer driving fusions. We also considerably improve on the automated visualisation of the high impact structural variants to highlight the effects of the variants on the resulting transcripts. The resulting framework greatly improves on readily detecting clinically actionable structural variants.

AB BACKGROUND: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm records advance care planning for patients with advanced illness or frailty as actionable medical records. The National POLST Paradigm Task Force recommends that physicians, advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), and physician assistants (PAs) be permitted to execute POLST forms.; OBJECTIVE: To investigate the percentage of Oregon POLST forms signed by APRNs, and examine the obstacles faced by states attempting to allow APRNs to sign POLST forms.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional.; SETTING/SUBJECTS: 226,101 Oregon POLST Registry forms from 2010 to 2015.; MEASUREMENTS: POLST forms in the Oregon Registry were matched with signer type (MD, DO, APRN, PA).; RESULTS: 226,101 POLST forms have been added to the Oregon POLST Registry from 2010 to 2015: 85.3% of forms were signed by a physician, 10.9% of forms were signed by an APRN, and 3.8% of forms were signed by a PA. From 2010 to 2015, the overall percentage of POLST forms signed by an APRN has increased from 9.0% in 2010 to 11.9% in 2015. Physicians are authorized signers in all 19 states with endorsed POLST Paradigm programs; 16 of these states also authorize APRN signature, and 3 states (LA, NY, and GA) allow only physicians to sign.; CONCLUSIONS: More than 10% of Oregon POLST forms are signed by APRNs. Given the need for timely POLST form completion, ideally by a member of the interdisciplinary team who knows the patient's preferences best, these data support authorizing APRNs to complete POLST forms.

AB The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is an established oncogenic driver of tumor growth in certain tumor types, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, in which constitutively active mutant forms of KIT represent an actionable target for small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. There is also considerable potential for KIT to influence tumor growth indirectly based on its expression and function in cell types of the innate immune system, most notably mast cells. We have evaluated syngeneic mouse tumor models for antitumor effects of an inhibitory KIT mAb, dosed either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-KIT mAb treatment enhanced the antitumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs, and promoted immune responses by selectively reducing the immunosuppressive monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell population and by restoring CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell populations to levels observed in naive mice. These data provide a rationale for clinical investigation of the human KIT-specific mAb KTN0158 in novel immuno-oncology combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapeutic agents across a range of tumor types.

AB Cancer is a disease of complex genetic alterations, and comprehensive genetic diagnosis is beneficial to match each patient to appropriate therapy. However, acquisition of representative tumor samples is invasive and sometimes impossible. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising tool to use as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer mutation profiling. Here we implemented targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) with a customized gene panel of 382 cancer-relevant genes on 605 ctDNA samples in multiple cancer types. Overall, tumor-specific mutations were identified in 87% of ctDNA samples, with mutation spectra highly concordant with their matched tumor tissues. 71% of patients had at least one clinically-actionable mutation, 76% of which have suggested drugs approved or in clinical trials. In particular, our study reveals a unique mutation spectrum in Chinese lung cancer patients which could be used to guide treatment decisions and monitor drug-resistant mutations. Taken together, our study demonstrated the feasibility of clinically-useful targeted NGS-based ctDNA mutation profiling to guide treatment decisions in cancer.

AB Identifying ways to measure access, availability, and utilization of health-care services, relative to at-risk areas or populations, is critical in providing practical and actionable information to key stakeholders. This study identified the prevalence and geospatial distribution of fall-related emergency medical services (EMS) calls in relation to the delivery of an evidence-based fall prevention program in Tarrant County, Texas over a 3-year time period. It aims to educate public health professionals and EMS first respondents about the application of geographic information system programs to identify risk-related "hot spots," service gaps, and community assets to reduce falls among older adults. On average, 96.09 (±108.65) calls were received per ZIP Code (ranging from 0 calls to 386 calls). On average, EMS calls per ZIP Code increased from 30.80 (±34.70) calls in 2009 to 33.75 (±39.58) calls in 2011, which indicate a modest annual call increase over the 3-year study period. The percent of ZIP Codes offering A Matter of Balance/Volunteer Lay Leader Model (AMOB/VLL) workshops increased from 27.3% in 2009 to 34.5% in 2011. On average, AMOB/VLL workshops were offered in ZIP Codes with more fall-related EMS calls over the 3-year study period. Findings suggest that the study community was providing evidence-based fall prevention programming (AMOB/VLL workshops) in higher-risk areas. Opportunities for strategic service expansion were revealed through the identification of fall-related hot spots and asset mapping.

AB INTRODUCTION: A practice embarks on a radical reformulation of how care is designed and delivered when it decides to integrate medical and behavioral health care for its patients and success depends on managing complex change in a complex system. We examined the ways change is managed when integrating behavioral health and medical care.; METHOD: Observational cross-case comparative study of 19 primary care and community mental health practices. We collected mixed methods data through practice surveys, observation, and semistructured interviews. We analyzed data using a data-driven, emergent approach.; RESULTS: The change management strategies that leadership employed to manage the changes of integrating behavioral health and medical care included: (a) advocating for a mission and vision focused on integrated care; (b) fostering collaboration, with a focus on population care and a team-based approaches; (c) attending to learning, which includes viewing the change process as continuous, and creating a culture that promoted reflection and continual improvement; (d) using data to manage change, and (e) developing approaches to finance integration.; DISCUSSION: This paper reports the change management strategies employed by practice leaders making changes to integrate care, as observed by independent investigators. We offer an empirically based set of actionable recommendations that are relevant to a range of leaders (policymakers, medical directors) and practice members who wish to effectively manage the complex changes associated with integrated primary care.

AB The immunostimulatory properties of radiation therapy (RT) have recently generated widespread interest due to preclinical and clinical evidence that tumor-localized RT can sometimes induce antitumor immune responses mediating regression of non-irradiated metastases (abscopal effect). The ability of RT to activate antitumor T cells explains the synergy of RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which has been well documented in mouse tumor models and is supported by observations of more frequent abscopal responses in patients refractory to immunotherapy who receive RT during immunotherapy. However, abscopal responses following RT remain relatively rare in the clinic, and antitumor immune responses are not effectively induced by RT against poorly immunogenic mouse tumors. This suggests that in order to improve the pro-immunogenic effects of RT, it is necessary to identify and overcome the barriers that pre-exist and/or are induced by RT in the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, RT induces an immunogenic death of cancer cells associated with release of powerful danger signals that are essential to recruit and activate dendritic cells (DCs) and initiate antitumor immune responses. On the other hand, RT can promote the generation of immunosuppressive mediators that hinder DCs activation and impair the function of effector T cells. In this review, we discuss current evidence that several inhibitory pathways are induced and modulated in irradiated tumors. In particular, we will focus on factors that regulate and limit radiation-induced immunogenicity and emphasize current research on actionable targets that could increase the effectiveness of radiation-induced in situ tumor vaccination.

AB BACKGROUND: Timely referral of patients with CKD has been associated with cost and mortality benefits, but referrals are often done too late in the course of the disease. Clinical decision support (CDS) offers a potential solution, but interventions have failed because they were not designed to support the physician workflow. We sought to identify user requirements for a chronic kidney disease (CKD) CDS system to promote timely referral.; METHODS: We interviewed primary care physicians (PCPs) to identify data needs for a CKD CDS system that would encourage timely referral and also gathered information about workflow to assess risk factors for progression of CKD. Interviewees were general internists recruited from a network of 14 primary care clinics affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). We then performed a qualitative analysis to identify user requirements and system attributes for a CKD CDS system.; RESULTS: Of the 12 participants, 25% were women, the mean age was 53 (range 37-82), mean years in clinical practice was 27 (range 11-58). We identified 21 user requirements. Seven of these user requirements were related to support for the referral process workflow, including access to pertinent information and support for longitudinal co-management. Six user requirements were relevant to PCP management of CKD, including management of risk factors for progression, interpretation of biomarkers of CKD severity, and diagnosis of the cause of CKD. Finally, eight user requirements addressed user-centered design of CDS, including the need for actionable information, links to guidelines and reference materials, and visualization of trends.; CONCLUSION: These 21 user requirements can be used to design an intuitive and usable CDS system with the attributes necessary to promote timely referral.

AB BACKGROUND: Alarm fatigue in the ICU setting has been well documented in the literature. The ICU's high-intensity environment requires staff's vigilant attention, and distraction from false and non-actionable alarms pulls staff away from important tasks, creates dissatisfaction, and is a potential patient safety risk if alarms are missed or ignored. This project was intended to improve patient safety by optimizing alarm systems in a cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit (CVSICU). Specific aims were to examine nurses' attitudes toward clinical alarm signals, assess nurses' ability to discriminate audible alarm signals, and implement a bundled set of best practices for monitor alarm reduction without undermining patient safety.; METHODS: CVSICU nurses completed an alarm perception survey and participated in alarm discriminability testing. Nurse survey data and baseline monitor alarm data were used to select targeted alarm reduction interventions, which were progressively phased in. Monitor alarm data and cardiorespiratory event data were trended over one year.; RESULTS: Five of the most frequent CVSICU monitor alarm types-pulse oximetry, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse oximetry sensor, and ventricular tachycardia>2-were targeted. After implementation, there was a 61% reduction in average alarms per monitored bed and a downward trend in cardiorespiratory events.; CONCLUSION: To reduce alarm fatigue it is important to decrease alarm burden through targeted interventions. Methods to reduce non-actionable alarms include adding short delays to allow alarm self-correction, adjusting default alarm threshold limits, providing alarm notification through a secondary device, and teaching staff to optimize alarm settings for individual patients.

AB As public safety communication evolved, each disaster or emergency presented unique challenges for emergency managers and others response to disasters. Yet, a foundational focus is the timely dissemination of accurate information to keep communities informed and able to prepare, mitigate, respond, and recover. For the campus community, the increase in bomb threats, active shooter incidents, and geographic-based natural disasters call for the discovery of reliable and cost-effective solutions for emergency information management. Social media is becoming a critical asset in this endeavor. This article examines the evolution of public safety communication, the unique setting of the campus community, and social media's role in campus disaster resilience. In addition, an exploratory study was done to better understand the perception of social media use for public safety within the campus community. The findings provide practical recommendations for campus emergency management professions; however, future research is needed to provide specific, actionable ways to achieve these goals as well as understand how diverse universities utilize a variety of platforms.

AB : Genetic research into ageing, longevity and late-onset disease is becoming increasingly common. Yet, there is a paucity of knowledge related to clinical actionability and the return of pathogenic variants to otherwise healthy elderly individuals. Whether or not genetic research in the elderly should be managed differently from standard practices adapted for younger populations has not yet been defined. In this article, we provide an overview of ethical and practical challenges in preparing for a genetic study of over 14 000 healthy Australians aged 70 years or older enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Healthy Ageing Biobank. At the time of consent, all participants in this study were free of life-threatening illness, cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment. ASPREE is thus a cohort of healthy elderly individuals with seemingly minimal burden of genetic disease recruited without ascertainment bias. The cohort presents a unique opportunity to address the penetrance of known pathogenic variants in a population without disease symptoms; however, it also raises a number of ethical concerns regarding the interpretation and disclosure of variants with known clinical actionability. Some of the challenges include (a) how to manage the interpretation, disclosure and actioning of pathogenic variants found in otherwise healthy elderly adults without disease symptoms, (b) whether or not to disclose findings for the benefit of family members rather than elderly consented donors themselves, (c) how to manage the return of genetic findings to the elderly individuals who are now in severe cognitive decline or terminal illness, (d) how to ensure quality of information and clinical service upon disclosure of results to this demographic and (e) how to prepare for the insurance implications of disclosing genetic information under Australian law. We discuss these and other dilemmas and propose a defensible plan of management.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN83772183. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, occurs in 1 in 2250 births, either in isolation or as part of a syndrome. Mutations in at least 57 genes have been associated with craniosynostosis, but only a minority of these are included in routine laboratory genetic testing.; METHODS: We used exome or whole genome sequencing to seek a genetic cause in a cohort of 40 subjects with craniosynostosis, selected by clinical or molecular geneticists as being high-priority cases, and in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative.; RESULTS: We identified likely associated mutations in 15 patients (37.5%), involving 14 different genes. All genes were mutated in single families, except for IL11RA (two families). We classified the other positive diagnoses as follows: commonly mutated craniosynostosis genes with atypical presentation (EFNB1, TWIST1); other core craniosynostosis genes (CDC45, MSX2, ZIC1); genes for which mutations are only rarely associated with craniosynostosis (FBN1, HUWE1, KRAS, STAT3); and known disease genes for which a causal relationship with craniosynostosis is currently unknown (AHDC1, NTRK2). In two further families, likely novel disease genes are currently undergoing functional validation. In 5 of the 15 positive cases, the (previously unanticipated) molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences for either genetic or medical management (mutations in EFNB1, FBN1, KRAS, NTRK2, STAT3).; CONCLUSIONS: This substantial genetic heterogeneity, and the multiple actionable mutations identified, emphasises the benefits of exome/whole genome sequencing to identify causal mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has yielded negative results.

AB Smoking is endemic in drug abuse treatment populations, and smoking prevalence in this population appears unresponsive to existing tobacco control strategies. Clinical and policy guidelines encourage programs to address smoking among clients, and research has identified key barriers to doing so. This report explores the practice of staff and clients smoking together in drug treatment programs, and how this practice is associated with other tobacco-related measures. Clients (N=1113) were surveyed and program directors were interviewed in a national sample of 24 drug abuse treatment programs affiliated with the NIDA Clinical Trials Network. Clients were asked whether they observed staff and clients smoking together in their program and, using program as the unit of analysis, this measure was tested for its association with client-level and program-level tobacco-related outcomes. Higher rates of staff and client smoking together were associated with higher staff smoking prevalence (p=0.006), lower rates of client thoughts about quitting in the next 30days (p=0.027), more negative client attitudes toward quitting smoking (p=0.004), and with clients receiving fewer tobacco-related services (p=0.024). These findings illuminate an actionable, low cost policy intervention to address smoking in drug abuse treatment, which is to prohibit the practice of staff smoking together with clients. In the interest of the health of clients whom they serve, counselors, program directors, state regulatory agencies, and federal funding agencies should act to end this practice.

AB Tumours are comprised of a highly heterogeneous population of cells, of which only a small subset of stem-like cells possess the ability to regenerate tumours in vivo. These cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a significant clinical challenge as they are resistant to conventional cancer therapies and play essential roles in metastasis and tumour relapse. Despite this realization and great interest in CSCs, it has been difficult to develop CSC-targeted treatments due to our limited understanding of CSC biology. Here, we present evidence that specific histone deacetylases (HDACs) play essential roles in the CSC phenotype. Utilizing a novel CSC model, we discovered that the HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC7, are specifically over-expressed in CSCs when compared to non-stem-tumour-cells (nsTCs). Furthermore, we determine that HDAC1 and HDAC7 are necessary to maintain CSCs, and that over-expression of HDAC7 is sufficient to augment the CSC phenotype. We also demonstrate that clinically available HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) targeting HDAC1 and HDAC7 can be used to preferentially target CSCs. These results provide actionable insights that can be rapidly translated into CSC-specific therapies.

AB Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are generating a vast amount of data. This exacerbates the current challenge of translating NGS data into actionable clinical interpretations. We have comprehensively combined germline and somatic nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) that affect drug binding sites in order to investigate their prevalence. The integrated data thus generated in conjunction with exome or whole-genome sequencing can be used to identify patients who may not respond to a specific drug because of alterations in drug binding efficacy due to nsSNVs in the target protein's gene. To identify the nsSNVs that may affect drug binding, protein-drug complex structures were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) followed by identification of amino acids in the protein-drug binding sites using an occluded surface method. Then, the germline and somatic mutations were mapped to these amino acids to identify which of these alter protein-drug binding sites. Using this method we identified 12993 amino acid-drug binding sites across 253 unique proteins bound to 235 unique drugs. The integration of amino acid-drug binding sites data with both germline and somatic nsSNVs data sets revealed 3133 nsSNVs affecting amino acid-drug binding sites. In addition, a comprehensive drug target discovery was conducted based on protein structure similarity and conservation of amino acid-drug binding sites. Using this method, 81 paralogs were identified that could serve as alternative drug targets. In addition, non-human mammalian proteins bound to drugs were used to identify 142 homologs in humans that can potentially bind to drugs. In the current protein-drug pairs that contain somatic mutations within their binding site, we identified 85 proteins with significant differential gene expression changes associated with specific cancer types. Information on protein-drug binding predicted drug target proteins and prevalence of both somatic and germline nsSNVs that disrupt these binding sites can provide valuable knowledge for personalized medicine treatment. A web portal is available where nsSNVs from individual patient can be checked by scanning against DrugVar to determine whether any of the SNVs affect the binding of any drug in the database.

AB Drug sensitivity and resistance testing on diagnostic leukemia samples should provide important functional information to guide actionable target and biomarker discovery. We provide proof of concept data by profiling 60 drugs on 68 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples mostly from resistant disease in cocultures of bone marrow stromal cells. Patient-derived xenografts retained the original pattern of mutations found in the matched patient material. Stromal coculture did not prevent leukemia cell cycle activity, but a specific sensitivity profile to cell cycle-related drugs identified samples with higher cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo as leukemia xenografts. In patients with refractory relapses, individual patterns of marked drug resistance and exceptional responses to new agents of immediate clinical relevance were detected. The BCL2-inhibitor venetoclax was highly active below 10 nM in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) subsets, including MLL-AF4 and TCF3-HLF ALL, and in some T-cell ALLs (T-ALLs), predicting in vivo activity as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone and vincristine. Unexpected sensitivity to dasatinib with half maximal inhibitory concentration values below 20 nM was detected in 2 independent T-ALL cohorts, which correlated with similar cytotoxic activity of the SRC inhibitor KX2-391 and inhibition of SRC phosphorylation. A patient with refractory T-ALL was treated with dasatinib on the basis of drug profiling information and achieved a 5-month remission. Thus, drug profiling captures disease-relevant features and unexpected sensitivity to relevant drugs, which warrants further exploration of this functional assay in the context of clinical trials to develop drug repurposing strategies for patients with urgent medical needs. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB BACKGROUND: The importance of accurate and affordable mutation calling in fixed pathology samples is becoming increasingly important as we move into the era of personalised medicine. The Affymetrix OncoScan Array platform is designed to produce actionable mutation calls in archival material.; METHODS: We compared calls made using the OncoScan platform with calls made using a custom designed PCR panel followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), in order to benchmark the sensitivity and specificity of the OncoScan calls in a large cohort of fixed tumour samples. 392 fixed, clinical samples were sequenced, encompassing 641 PCR regions, 403 putative positive calls and 1528 putative negative calls.; RESULTS: A small number of mutations could not be validated, either due to large indels or pseudogenes impairing parts of the NGS pipeline. For the remainder, if calls were filtered according to simple quality metrics, both sensitivity and specificity for the OncoScan platform were over 98%. This applied even to samples with poorer sample quality and lower variant allele frequency (5-10%) than product claims indicated.; CONCLUSIONS: This benchmarking study will be useful to users and potential users of this platform, who wish to compare technologies or interpret their own results.

AB BACKGROUND: Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer (OM-CRC) often are unresponsive to chemotherapy and are associated with poor survival. To the authors' knowledge, the clinicopathologic and genomic predictors of OM-CRC are poorly characterized and optimal clinical management remains unclear.; METHODS: Women with a histopathological diagnosis of OM-CRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1999 to 2015 were identified. Next-generation somatic mutation profiling (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) was performed on 38 OM-CRC cases, including 21 matched tumor pairs/trios. Regression models were used to analyze variables associated with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).; RESULTS: Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) mutations were more frequent in cases of OM-CRC than in instances of CRC occurring without OM. SMAD4 and lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations were associated with reduced OS. Matched multisite tumor sequencing did not identify OM-specific genomic alterations. Of the 195 patients who underwent oophorectomy for OM-CRC (median age, 49 years with a progression-free survival of 9.4 months and an OS of 23 months from oophorectomy), 76% had extraovarian metastasis (EOM). In multivariable analysis, residual disease after surgery (R2 resection) was associated with worse survival. Patients with EOM were less likely to achieve R0/R1 surgical resection status (complete macroscopic resection without clinical/radiological evidence of disease) (48% vs 94%). However, if R0/R1 resection status was achieved, both patients with (35.9 months vs 12 months) and without (43.2 months vs 14.5 months) EOM were found to have better OS. Among 114 patients with R0/R1 resection status, 23 (20%) had no disease recurrence, including 10 patients (9%) with>3 years of follow-up.; CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function alterations in SMAD4 are frequent and predictive of worse survival in patients with OM-CRC. Similar to oligometastatic CRC to the lung or liver, surgical resection of OM-CRC is associated with a better outcome only if all macroscopic metastatic disease is resected.

AB BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas that arise at an estimated frequency of 8% to 13% in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Compared with their sporadic counterparts, NF1-associated MPNSTs (NF1-MPNSTs) develop in young adults, frequently recur (approximately 50% of cases), and carry a dismal prognosis. As such, most individuals affected with NF1-MPNSTs die within 5 years of diagnosis, despite surgical resection combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.; METHODS: Clinical genomic profiling was performed using 1000ng of DNA from 7 cases of NF1-MPNST, and bioinformatic analyses were conducted to identify genes with actionable mutations.; RESULTS: A total of 3 women and 4 men with NF1-MPNST were identified (median age, 38 years). Nonsynonymous mutations were discovered in 4 genes (neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1], ROS proto-oncogene 1 [ROS1], tumor protein p53 [TP53], and tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2]), which in addition were mutated in other MPNST cases in this sample set. Consistent with their occurrence in individuals with NF1, all tumors had at least 1 mutation in the NF1 gene. Whereas TP53 gene mutations are frequently observed in other cancers, ROS1 mutations are common in melanoma (15%-35%), another neural crest-derived malignancy. In contrast, TYK2 mutations are uncommon in other malignancies (<7%). In the current series, recurrent TYK2 mutations were identified in 2 cases of NF1-MPNST (30% of cases), whereas TYK2 protein overexpression was observed in 60% of MPNST cases using an independently generated tissue microarray, regardless of NF1 status.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinical genomic analysis of the current series of NF1-MPNST cases found that TYK2 is a new gene mutated in MPNST. Future work will focus on examining the utility of TYK2 expression as a biomarker and therapeutic target for these cancers.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in adults. Historically, the median survival after the diagnosis of brain metastases has been dismal and medical therapies had a limited role in the management of these patients.; RECENT FINDINGS: The advent of targeted therapy has ushered in an era of increased hope for patients with brain metastases. The most common malignancies that result in brain metastases-melanoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer, often have actionable mutations, which make them good candidates for targeted systemic therapy. These brain metastases have been shown to have relevant and sometimes divergent genetic alterations, and there has been a resurgence of interest in targeted drug delivery to the brain by using standard or pulsatile dosing to achieve adequate concentration in the brain. An increased understanding of oncogenic alterations, a surge in targeted drug development with good blood barrier penetration, and inclusion of patients with active brain metastases on clinical trials have led to improved outcomes for patients with brain metastases.

AB Purpose Incarcerated women around the globe are predominantly of reproductive age. Most of these women have been pregnant before, and many want to be sexually active and avoid pregnancy upon release. Yet few of these women are on a regular method of contraception. Providing contraceptive services for women in custody benefits individual and public health goals of reducing unintended pregnancy. This policy briefing reviews evidence for an unmet need for family planning in the correctional setting, and policy implications for expanding services. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The authors describe four model programs in the USA with established contraceptive services on site, highlighting practical steps other facilities can implement. Findings Correctional facilities health administrators, providers, advocates, and legislators should advance policies which should counsel women on family planning and should make a range of contraceptive methods available before release, while remaining sensitive to the potential pressure these women may feel to use birth control in this unique environment. Practical implications Family planning services for incarcerated women benefits individuals, facilities, and the community. Social implications Policies which enable correctional facilities to provide comprehensive family planning to incarcerated women - including reproductive life goals counseling and contraceptive method provision - promote equity in access to critical reproductive health services and also provide broad scale population level benefits in preventing unintended pregnancy or enabling counseling for healthy pregnancies for a group of women who often have limited access to such services. Originality/value This policy briefing highlights an area of health care in prisons and jails which gets little attention in research and in policy circles: family planning services for incarcerated women. In addition to reviewing the importance of such services for this population, the authors also highlight model family planning programs in correctional facilities. These provide actionable insights for other administrators and providers.

AB The TP53 tumor suppressor is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. In recent years, a blooming of research efforts based on both cell lines and mouse models have highlighted how deeply mutant p53 proteins affect fundamental cellular pathways with cancer-promoting outcomes. Neomorphic mutant p53 activities spread over multiple levels, impinging on chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation and microRNA maturation, shaping the proteome and the cell's metabolic pathways, and also exerting cytoplasmic functions and displaying cell-extrinsic effects. These tumorigenic activities are inextricably linked with the blend of highly corrupted processes that characterize the tumor context. Recent studies indicate that successful strategies to extract core aspects of mutant p53 oncogenic potential and to identify unique tumor dependencies entail the superimposition of large-scale analyses performed in multiple experimental systems, together with a mindful use of animal models. This will hopefully soon lead to the long-awaited inclusion of mutant p53 as an actionable target of clinical antitumor therapies. © 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

AB The global biodiversity crisis requires an engaged citizenry that provides collective support for public policies and recognizes the consequences of personal consumption decisions. Understanding the factors that affect personal engagement in proenvironmental behaviors is essential for the development of actionable conservation solutions. Zoos and aquariums may be some of the only places where many people can explore their relations with wild animals and proenvironmental behaviors. Using a moderated-mediation analysis of a survey of U.S. zoo and aquarium visitors (n = 3588), we explored the relationship between the sense of connection to animals and self-reported engagement in proenvironmental behaviors related to climate change and how this relationship is affected by certainty that climate change is happening, level of concern about climate change, and perceptions of effectiveness in personally addressing climate change. We found a significant, directional relationship between sense of connection to animals and self-reported proenvironmental behaviors. Political inclination within the conservative to liberal spectrum did not affect the relationship. We conclude that a personal sense of connection to animals may provide a foundation for educational and communication strategies to enhance involvement in proenvironmental actions. © 2016 The Authors.

AB Massive cancer genomics data have facilitated the rapid revolution of a novel oncology drug discovery paradigm through targeting clinically relevant driver genes or mutations for the development of precision oncology. Natural products with polypharmacological profiles have been demonstrated as promising agents for the development of novel cancer therapies. In this study, we developed an integrated systems pharmacology framework that facilitated identifying potential natural products that target mutated genes across 15 cancer types or subtypes in the realm of precision medicine. High performance was achieved for our systems pharmacology framework. In case studies, we computationally identified novel anticancer indications for several US Food and Drug Administration-approved or clinically investigational natural products (e.g., resveratrol, quercetin, genistein, and fisetin) through targeting significantly mutated genes in multiple cancer types. In summary, this study provides a powerful tool for the development of molecularly targeted cancer therapies through targeting the clinically actionable alterations by exploiting the systems pharmacology of natural products. © 2017 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Approximately 40-45% of younger and 10-20% of older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will be cured with current standard chemotherapy. The outlook is particularly gloomy for patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease (cure rates no higher than 10%). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only realistic hope of cure for these patients, is an option for only a minority. In recent years, much has been learned about the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of AML, and the clonal architecture of both de novo and secondary AML has begun to be unraveled. These advances have paved the way for rational drug development as new "drugable" targets have emerged. Although no new drug has been approved for AML in over four decades, with the exception of gemtuzumab ozogamycin, which was subsequently withdrawn, there is progress on the horizon with the possible regulatory approval soon of agents such as CPX-351 and midostaurin, the Food and Drug Administration "breakthrough" designation granted to venetoclax, and promising agents such as the IDH inhibitors AG-221 and AG-120, the smoothened inhibitor glasdegib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat. In our practice, we treat most patients with relapsed/refractory AML on clinical trials, taking into consideration their prior treatment history and response to the same. We utilize targeted sequencing of genes frequently mutated in AML to identify "actionable" mutations, e.g., in FLT3 or IDH1/2, and incorporate small-molecule inhibitors of these oncogenic kinases into our therapeutic regimens whenever possible. In the absence of actionable mutations, we rationally combine conventional agents with other novel therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and other targeted drugs. For fit patients up to the age of 65, we often use high-dose cytarabine-containing backbone regimens. For older or unfit patients, we prefer hypomethylating agent-based therapy. Finally, all patients with relapsed/refractory AML are evaluated for allogeneic HSCT.

AB Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. Maternal inflammation induced by microbial infection is a critical predisposing factor for PTB. However, biological processes associated with competency of pathogens, including viruses, to induce PTB or sensitize for secondary bacterial infection-driven PTB are unknown. We show that pathogen/pathogen-associated molecular pattern-driven activation of type I IFN/IFN receptor (IFNAR) was sufficient to prime for systemic and uterine proinflammatory chemokine and cytokine production and induction of PTB. Similarly, treatment with recombinant type I IFNs recapitulated such effects by exacerbating proinflammatory cytokine production and reducing the dose of secondary inflammatory challenge required for induction of PTB. Inflammatory challenge-driven induction of PTB was eliminated by defects in type I IFN, TLR, or IL-6 responsiveness, whereas the sequence of type I IFN sensing by IFNAR on hematopoietic cells was essential for regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, we also show that type I IFN priming effects are conserved from mice to nonhuman primates and humans, and expression of both type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines is upregulated in human PTB. Thus, activation of the type I IFN/IFNAR axis in pregnancy primes for inflammation-driven PTB and provides an actionable biomarker and therapeutic target for mitigating PTB risk.

AB Cognitive engineering is an applied field with roots in both cognitive science and engineering that has been used to support design of information displays, decision support, human-automation interaction, and training in numerous high risk domains ranging from nuclear power plant control to transportation and defense systems. Cognitive engineering provides a set of structured, analytic methods for data collection and analysis that intersect with and complement methods of Cognitive Informatics. These methods support discovery of aspects of the work that make performance challenging, as well as the knowledge, skills, and strategies that experts use to meet those challenges. Importantly, cognitive engineering methods provide novel representations that highlight the inherent complexities of the work domain and traceable links between the results of cognitive analyses and actionable design requirements. This article provides an overview of relevant cognitive engineering methods, and illustrates how they have been applied to the design of health information technology (HIT) systems. Additionally, although cognitive engineering methods have been applied in the design of user-centered informatics systems, methods drawn from informatics are not typically incorporated into a cognitive engineering analysis. This article presents a discussion regarding ways in which data-rich methods can inform cognitive engineering. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Although the incidence of distal gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) is declining in the United States, proximal esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJ) is increasing in incidence. GEC, including GC and EGJ, is treated uniformly in the metastatic setting. Overall survival in the metastatic setting remains poor. Molecular characterization of GEC has identified mutations and copy number variations, along with other oncogenes, biomarkers, and immuno-oncologic checkpoints that may serve as actionable therapeutic targets. This article reviews these key aberrations, their impact on protein expression, therapeutic implications, and clinical directions within each pathway. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB PURPOSE: As whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) move into routine clinical practice, it is timely to review data that might inform the debate regarding secondary findings (SF) and the development of policies that maximize participant benefit.; METHODS: We systematically searched for qualitative and quantitative studies that explored stakeholder views on SF in WES/WGS. Framework analysis was undertaken to identify major themes.; RESULTS: Forty-four articles reporting the views of 11,566 stakeholders were included. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of returning "actionable" findings, but definitions of actionability varied. Stakeholder views on SF disclosure exist along a spectrum: potential WES/WGS recipients' views were largely influenced by a sense of rights, whereas views of genomics professionals were informed by a sense of professional responsibility. Experience with genetic illness and testing resulted in greater caution about SF, suggesting that truly informed decisions require an understanding of the implications and limitations of WES/WGS and possible findings.; CONCLUSION: This review suggests that bidirectional interaction during consent might best facilitate informed decision making about SF and that dynamic forms of consent, allowing for changing preferences, should be considered. Research exploring views from wider perspectives and from recipients who have received SF is critical if evidence-based policies are to be achieved.Genet Med 19 3, 283-293.

AB PURPOSE: Genome-wide sequencing of cell-free (cf)DNA of pregnant women aims to detect fetal chromosomal imbalances. Because the largest fraction of cfDNA consists of maternal rather than fetal DNA fragments, maternally derived copy-number variants (CNVs) are also measured. Despite their potential clinical relevance, current analyses do not interpret maternal CNVs. Here, we explore the accuracy and clinical value of maternal CNV analysis.; METHODS: Noninvasive prenatal testing was performed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing on plasma samples. Following mapping of the sequencing reads, the landscape of maternal CNVs was charted for 9,882 women using SeqCBS analysis. Recurrent CNVs were validated retrospectively by comparing their incidence with published reports. Nonrecurrent CNVs were prospectively confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization or fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on maternal lymphocytes.; RESULTS: Consistent with population estimates, 10% nonrecurrent and 0.4% susceptibility CNVs for low-penetrant genomic disorders were identified. Five clinically actionable variants were reported to the pregnant women, including haploinsufficiency of RUNX1, a mosaicism for segmental chromosome 13 deletion, an unbalanced translocation, and two interstitial chromosome X deletions.; CONCLUSION: Shotgun sequencing of cfDNA not only enables the detection of fetal aneuploidies but also reveals the presence of maternal CNVs. Some of those variants are clinically actionable or could potentially be harmful for the fetus. Interrogating the maternal CNV landscape can improve overall pregnancy management, and we propose reporting those variants if clinically relevant. The identification and reporting of such CNVs pose novel counseling dilemmas that warrant further discussions and development of societal guidelines.Genet Med 19 3, 306-313.

AB BACKGROUND: The emergence and evolution of community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains in Africa is poorly understood. However, one particular MRSA lineage called ST88, appears to be rapidly establishing itself as an "African" CA-MRSA clone. In this study, we employed whole genome sequencing to provide more information on the genetic background of ST88 CA-MRSA isolates from Ghana and to describe in detail ST88 CA-MRSA isolates in comparison with other MRSA lineages worldwide.; METHODS: We first established a complete ST88 reference genome (AUS0325) using PacBio SMRT sequencing. We then used comparative genomics to assess relatedness among 17 ST88 CA-MRSA isolates recovered from patients attending Buruli ulcer treatment centres in Ghana, three non-African ST88s and 15 other MRSA lineages.; RESULTS: We show that Ghanaian ST88 forms a discrete MRSA lineage (harbouring SCCmec-IV [2B]). Gene content analysis identified five distinct genomic regions enriched among ST88 isolates compared with the other S. aureus lineages. The Ghanaian ST88 isolates had only 658 core genome SNPs and there was no correlation between phylogeny and geography, suggesting the recent spread of this clone. The lineage was also resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, tetracycline and chloramphenicol.; DISCUSSION: This study reveals that S. aureus ST88-IV is a recently emerging and rapidly spreading CA-MRSA clone in Ghana. The study highlights the capacity of small snapshot genomic studies to provide actionable public health information in resource limited settings. To our knowledge this is the first genomic assessment of the ST88 CA-MRSA clone.

AB Recent advances in genomic technologies have revolutionized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) understanding by identifying potential novel actionable genomic alterations. Consequently, current risk stratification at diagnosis not only relies on cytogenetics, but also on the inclusion of several of these abnormalities. Despite this progress, AML remains a heterogeneous and complex malignancy with variable response to current therapy. Although copy-number alterations (CNAs) are accepted prognostic markers in cancers, large-scale genomic studies aiming at identifying specific prognostic CNA-based markers in AML are still lacking. Using 367 AML, we identified four recurrent CNA on chromosomes 11 and 21 that predicted outcome even after adjusting for standard prognostic risk factors and potentially delineated two new subclasses of AML with poor prognosis. ERG amplification, the most frequent CNA, was related to cytarabine resistance, a cornerstone drug of AML therapy. These findings were further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Our results demonstrate that specific CNA are of independent prognostic relevance, and provide new molecular information into the genomic basis of AML and cytarabine response. Finally, these CNA identified two potential novel risk groups of AML, which when confirmed prospectively, may improve the clinical risk stratification and potentially the AML outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: The increasing practicality of genomic sequencing technology has led to its incorporation into routine clinical practice. Successful identification and targeting of driver genomic alterations that provide proliferative and survival advantages to tumor cells have led to approval and ongoing development of several targeted cancer therapies. Within many major cancer centers, molecular tumor boards are constituted to shepherd precision medicine into clinical practice.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: In July 2014, the Clinical Genomics Action Committee (CGAC) was established as the molecular tumor board companion to the Personalized Medicine Clinical Service (PMCS) at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. The processes and outcomes of the program were assessed in order to help others move into the practice of precision medicine.; RESULTS: Through the establishment and initial 1,400 patients of the PMCS and its associated molecular tumor board at a major cancer center, five practical lessons of broad applicability have been learned: transdisciplinary engagement, the use of the molecular report as an aid to clinical management, clinical actionability, getting therapeutic options to patients, and financial considerations. Value to patients includes access to cutting-edge practice merged with individualized preferences in treatment and care.; CONCLUSIONS: Genomic-driven cancer medicine is increasingly becoming a part of routine clinical practice. For successful implementation of precision cancer medicine, strategically organized molecular tumor boards are critical to provide objective evidence-based translation of observed molecular alterations into patient-centered clinical action. Molecular tumor board implementation models along with clinical and economic outcomes will define future treatment standards. The Oncologist 2017;22:144-151Implications for Practice: It is clear that the increasing practicality of genetic tumor sequencing technology has led to its incorporation as part of routine clinical practice. Subsequently, many cancer centers are seeking to develop a personalized medicine services and/or molecular tumor board to shepherd precision medicine into clinical practice. This article discusses the key lessons learned through the establishment and development of a molecular tumor board and personalized medicine clinical service. This article highlights practical issues and can serve as an important guide to other centers as they conceive and develop their own personalized medicine services and molecular tumor boards. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Thyroid dysfunction and hypertension (HTN) have been sporadically reported with sunitinib (SUN) and sorafenib (SOR). Determination of the side effect incidence will enhance monitoring and management recommendations.; METHODS: An observational cohort study was performed using deidentified pharmacy claims data from a 3-year period to evaluate patients prescribed SUN, SOR, or capecitabine (CAP; comparison group). The primary outcome was time to first prescription for thyroid replacement or HTN treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models.; RESULTS: A total of 20,061 patients were eligible for evaluation of thyroid replacement therapy, which was initiated in 11.6% of those receiving SUN (HR, 16.77; 95% CI, 13.54-20.76), 2.6% of those receiving SOR (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.46-4.98), and 1% of those receiving CAP, with median time to initiation of 4 months (range, 1-35 months). A total of 14,468 patients were eligible for evaluation of HTN therapy, which was initiated in 21% of SUN recipients (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 4.19-5.74), 14% of SOR recipients (HR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.69-3.91), and 5% of CAP recipients, with median time to initiation of 1 month (range, 1-18 months) for SOR and 2 months (range, 1-25 months) for SUN.; CONCLUSION: SUN and SOR significantly increased the risk for clinically relevant hypothyroidism; the risk was at least 4 times greater with SUN than with SOR. Patients receiving SUN and SOR had a similar elevated risk for clinically relevant HTN. These data provide robust measures of the incidence and time to onset of these clinically actionable adverse events. The Oncologist 2017;22:208-212Implications for Practice: The side effect profiles for novel therapies are typically used to create monitoring and management recommendations using clinical trial data from patient populations that may not represent those seen in standard clinical practice. This analysis using a large pharmacy claims database better reflects typical patients treated with sorafenib or sunitinib outside of a clinical trial. The findings of increased need for thyroid replacement in patients receiving sunitinib compared with sorafenib and a similar increase in need for hypertension therapy with both agents can be used to form clinically relevant monitoring recommendations for these agents. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) need usable information on how to live well and slow disease progression. This information is complex, difficult to communicate, and changes during the course of the disease. We examined lifestyle-related printed CKD patient education materials focusing on actionability and visual aids. From a previous systematic review assessing readability of CKD patient information, we identified materials targeting nutrition, exercise, and self-management. We applied the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) to evaluate how easy materials were to understand (understandability) and act on (actionability). We created the 5C image checklist and systematically examined all visual aids for clarity, contribution, contradiction, and caption. Of the 26 materials included, one fifth (n=5, 19%) were rated "not suitable" on SAM and fewer than half (n=11, 42%) were rated "superior." PEMAT mean subdomain scores were suboptimal for actionability (52) and visuals (37). Overall, more than half of all 223 graphics (n=127, 57%) contributed no meaning to the text. Images in three documents (12%) directly contradicted messaging in the text. CKD lifestyle information materials require focused improvements in both actionability of advice given and use of visual aids to support people with CKD to self-manage their condition. The fifth C is culture and is best evaluated by user-testing.

AB Interest in precision diagnostics has been fuelled by the concept that early detection of cancer would benefit patients; that is, if detected early, more tumours should be resectable and treatment more efficacious. Serum contains massive amounts of potentially diagnostic information, and affinity proteomics has risen as an accurate approach to decipher this, to generate actionable information that should result in more precise and evidence-based options to manage cancer. To achieve this, we need to move from single to multiplex biomarkers, a so-called signature, that can provide significantly increased diagnostic accuracy. This Opinion article focuses on the progress being made in identifying protein biomarker signatures of clinical utility, using blood-based proteomics.

AB Gastroesophageal (GE) malignancies make up a significant and growing segment of newly diagnosed cancers. Approximately 80% of patients who have GE cancers die within 5 years of diagnosis, which means that effective treatments for these malignancies need to be found. Currently, targeted therapies have a minimal role in this disease group. Intensive study of the molecular biology of GE cancers is a relatively new and ongoing venture, but it has already led to a significant increase in our understanding of these malignancies. This understanding, although still limited, has the potential to enhance our ability to develop targeted therapies in conjunction with the ability to identify actionable gene mutations and perform genomic profiling to predict drug resistance. Several cell surface growth factor receptors have been found to play a prominent role in GE cancer cell signaling. This discovery has led to the approval of 2 agents within the last few years: trastuzumab, an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibody used in the first-line treatment of HER2-positive GE cancers, and ramucirumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody that is currently used in later lines of therapy. This review discusses the current state of molecular testing in GE cancers, along with the known molecular biology and current and investigational treatments. The development of trastuzumab and ramucirumab represents a significant advance in our ability to make use of GE tumor molecular profiles. As our understanding of the impact of molecular aberrations on drug effectiveness and disease outcomes increases, we anticipate improved therapy for patients with GE cancers.

AB Phenotypic differences in drug responses have been associated with known pharmacogenomic loci, but many remain to be characterized. Therefore, we developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels to enable broad and unbiased inspection of genes that are involved in pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs). These panels feature repetitively optimized probes to capture up to 114 PK/PD-related genes with high coverage (99.6%) and accuracy (99.9%). Sequencing of a Korean cohort (n = 376) with the panels enabled profiling of actionable variants as well as rare variants of unknown functional consequences. Notably, variants that occurred at low frequency were enriched with likely protein-damaging variants and previously unreported variants. Furthermore, in vitro evaluation of four pharmacogenes, including cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19), confirmed that many of these rare variants have considerable functional impact. The present study suggests that targeted NGS panels are readily applicable platforms to facilitate comprehensive profiling of pharmacogenes, including common but also rare variants that warrant screening for personalized medicine. © 2016 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide. Despite declining incidences, the prognosis remains dismal in Western countries and is better in Asian countries with national cancer screening programs. Complete endoscopic or surgical resection of the primary tumor with or without lymphadenectomy offers the only chance of cure in the early stage of the disease. Survival of more locally advanced gastric cancers was improved by the introduction of perioperative, adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy. However, the identification and usage of novel predictive and diagnostic targets is urgently needed. Areas covered: Recent comprehensive molecular profiling of gastric cancer proposed four molecular subtypes, i.e. Epstein-Barr virus-associated, microsatellite instable, chromosomal instable and genomically stable carcinomas. The new molecular classification will spur clinical trials exploring novel targeted therapeutics. This review summarizes recent advancements of the molecular classification, and based on that, putative pitfalls for the development of tissue-based companion diagnostics, i.e. prevalence of actionable targets and therapeutic efficacy, tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution, impact of ethnicity on gastric cancer biology, and standards of care in the East and West. Expert commentary: The overall low prevalence of actionable targets and tumor heterogeneity are the two main obstacles of precision medicine for gastric cancer.

AB In this work we propose a comprehensive framework based on first-order logic (FOL) for mitigating (identifying and addressing) interactions between multiple clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) applied to a multi-morbid patient while also considering patient preferences related to the prescribed treatment. With this framework we respond to two fundamental challenges associated with clinical decision support: (1) concurrent application of multiple CPGs and (2) incorporation of patient preferences into the decision making process. We significantly expand our earlier research by (1) proposing a revised and improved mitigation-oriented representation of CPGs and secondary medical knowledge for addressing adverse interactions and incorporating patient preferences and (2) introducing a new mitigation algorithm. Specifically, actionable graphs representing CPGs allow for parallel and temporal activities (decisions and actions). Revision operators representing secondary medical knowledge support temporal interactions and complex revisions across multiple actionable graphs. The mitigation algorithm uses the actionable graphs, revision operators and available (and possibly incomplete) patient information represented in FOL. It relies on a depth-first search strategy to find a valid sequence of revisions and uses theorem proving and model finding techniques to identify applicable revision operators and to establish a management scenario for a given patient if one exists. The management scenario defines a safe (interaction-free) and preferred set of activities together with possible patient states. We illustrate the use of our framework with a clinical case study describing two patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, and who are managed according to CPGs for these diseases. While in this paper we are primarily concerned with the methodological aspects of mitigation, we also briefly discuss a high-level proof of concept implementation of the proposed framework in the form of a clinical decision support system (CDSS). The proposed mitigation CDSS "insulates" clinicians from the complexities of the FOL representations and provides semantically meaningful summaries of mitigation results. Ultimately we plan to implement the mitigation CDSS within our MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) decision support environment. Copyright A© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Patients were evaluated for medication orders with an actionable boxed warning; if boxed warning nonadherence occurred, the physician's reason was determined. Patients with boxed warning nonadherence were monitored for adverse drug reactions until discharge.; RESULTS: A total of 393 patients (224 general medicine and 169 ICU) were evaluated for nonadherence to 149 actionable boxed warnings. There were 293 drugs (175 general medicine and 118 ICU) with boxed warnings prescribed, and more than 50% of these were medications restarted from home. A total of 23 boxed warning nonadherences occurred in general medicine patients, and NSAIDs accounted for 81% of these events. ICU patients experienced 11 boxed warning nonadherences, with nearly 54% from anti-infectives and immunosuppressants. Antipsychotics were the most commonly ordered boxed warning medication class in ICU patients. Reasons for nonadherence included knowledge deficit and an acceptable risk-to-benefit ratio. Two adverse drug reactions occurred from boxed warning nonadherences, both because of a drug-drug interaction.; CONCLUSIONS: Boxed warning nonadherence is a concern in the inpatient setting, specifically with NSAID use in general medicine patients and antipsychotic use in ICU patients. More than half of boxed warning nonadherence occurred in medications restarted from home, which emphasizes the need for medication evaluation during transitions of care.

AB This study analyzed clinically actionable pharmacogenotypes for clopidogrel, warfarin, statins, thiopurines, and tacrolimus using microarray data for 2121 participants (55-85 years) from the Australian Hunter Community Study (HCS). At least 74% of participants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 72%-76%) had strong level evidence for at least one medium- or high-risk actionable genotype that would trigger a change in standard therapy under current international recommendations. About 14% of these participants (95% CI: 12%-16%) were taking medication potentially affected by the genotype in question. Furthermore, ~2.6% of all participants with medication data (95% CI: 1.4%-3.8%) had a high-risk clinically actionable genotype for a medication to which they were exposed. This represents a considerable number of people at the population level. Although relationships between genotype and health outcomes remain contentious, pharmacogenotyping of multiple variants simultaneously may have considerable potential to improve medication safety and efficacy for older people in the community.

AB Pandemic influenza represents a serious threat not only to the population of the United States, but also to its economy. In this study, we analyze the total economic consequences of potential influenza outbreaks in the United States for four cases based on the distinctions between disease severity and the presence/absence of vaccinations. The analysis is based on data and parameters on influenza obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and the general literature. A state-of-the-art economic impact modeling approach, computable general equilibrium, is applied to analyze a wide range of potential impacts stemming from the outbreaks. This study examines the economic impacts from changes in medical expenditures and workforce participation, and also takes into consideration different types of avoidance behavior and resilience actions not previously fully studied. Our results indicate that, in the absence of avoidance and resilience effects, a pandemic influenza outbreak could result in a loss in U.S. GDP of $25.4 billion, but that vaccination could reduce the losses to $19.9 billion. When behavioral and resilience factors are taken into account, a pandemic influenza outbreak could result in GDP losses of $45.3 billion without vaccination and $34.4 billion with vaccination. These results indicate the importance of including a broader set of causal factors to achieve more accurate estimates of the total economic impacts of not just pandemic influenza but biothreats in general. The results also highlight a number of actionable items that government policymakers and public health officials can use to help reduce potential economic losses from the outbreaks. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB A collaboration that grew over time between local hemovigilance stakeholders and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) resulted in the change from a paper-based method of reporting adverse reactions and monthly transfusion activity for regulatory compliance purposes to statewide adoption of electronic reporting via the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The NHSN is a web-based surveillance system that offers the capacity to capture transfusion-related adverse events, incidents, and monthly transfusion statistics from participating facilities. Massachusetts' hospital blood banks share the data they enter into NHSN with the MDPH to satisfy reporting requirements. Users of the NHSN Hemovigilance Module adhere to specified data entry guidelines, resulting in data that are comparable and standardized. Keys to successful statewide adoption of this reporting method include the fostering of strong partnerships with local hemovigilance champions and experts, engagement of regulatory and epidemiology divisions at the state health department, the leveraging of existing relationships with hospital NHSN administrators, and the existence of a regulatory deadline for implementation. Although limitations exist, successful implementation of statewide use of the NHSN Hemovigilance Module for hospital blood bank reporting is possible. The result is standardized, actionable data at both the hospital and state level that can facilitate interfacility comparisons, benchmarking, and opportunities for practice improvement. © 2016 AABB.

AB We examine key study design challenges of using stated-preference methods to estimate the value of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a specific example of genomic testing. Assessing the value of WGS is complex because WGS provides multiple findings, some of which can be incidental in nature and unrelated to the specific health concerns that motivated the test. In addition, WGS results can include actionable findings (variants considered to be clinically useful and can be acted on), findings for which evidence for best clinical action is not available (variants considered clinically valid but do not meet as high of a standard for clinical usefulness), and findings of unknown significance. We consider three key challenges encountered in designing our national study on the value of WGS-layers of uncertainty, potential downstream consequences with endogenous aspects, and both positive and negative utility associated with testing information-and potential solutions as strategies to address these challenges. We conceptualized the decision to acquire WGS information as a series of sequential choices that are resolved separately. To determine the value of WGS information at the initial decision to undergo WGS, we used contingent valuation questions, and to elicit respondent preferences for reducing risks of health problems and the consequences of taking the steps to reduce these risks, we used a discrete-choice experiment. We conclude by considering the implications for evaluating the value of other complex health technologies that involve multiple forms of uncertainty.

AB Molecular diagnostics has generated substantial dividends in dissecting the genetic basis of myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia. The family of diseases generated by dysregulated fusion tyrosine kinase (TK) genes is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) category, "Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, or with PCM1-JAK2" In addition to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), these patients can present with myelodysplastic syndrome/MPN, as well as de novo or secondary mixed-phenotype leukemias or lymphomas. Eosinophilia is a common, but not invariable, feature of these diseases. The natural history of PDGFRA- and PDGFRB-rearranged neoplasms has been dramatically altered by imatinib. In contrast, patients with FGFR1 and JAK2 fusion TK genes exhibit a more aggressive course and variable sensitivity to current TK inhibitors, and in most cases, long-term disease-free survival may only be achievable with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Similar poor prognosis outcomes may be observed with rearrangements of FLT3 or ABL1 (eg, both of which commonly partner with ETV6), and further investigation is needed to validate their inclusion in the current WHO-defined group of eosinophilia-associated TK fusion-driven neoplasms. The diagnosis chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS) is assigned to patients with MPN with eosinophilia and nonspecific cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities and/or increased myeloblasts. Myeloid mutation panels have identified somatic variants in patients with a provisional diagnosis of hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance, reclassifying some of these cases as eosinophilia-associated neoplasms. Looking forward, one of the many challenges will be how to use the results of molecular profiling to guide prognosis and selection of actionable therapeutic targets. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB BACKGROUND: Infantile myofibromatosis belongs to a family of soft tissue tumors. The majority of these tumors have benign behavior but resistant and malignant courses are known, namely in tumors with visceral involvement. The standard of care is surgical resection. Observations suggest that low dose chemotherapy is beneficial. The treatment of resistant or relapsed patients with multifocal disease remains challenging. Patients that harbor an actionable mutation in the kinase domain are potential subjects for targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.; CASE PRESENTATION: An infant boy with inborn generalized infantile myofibromatosis that included bone, intracranial, soft tissue and visceral involvement was treated according to recent recommendations with low dose chemotherapy. The presence of a partial but temporary response led to a second line of treatment with six cycles of chemotherapy, which achieved a partial response again but was followed by severe toxicity. The generalized progression of the disease was observed later. Genetic analyses were performed and revealed a PDGFRB gene c.1681C>A missense heterozygous germline mutation, high PDGFRbeta phosphokinase activity within the tumor and the heterozygous germline Slavic Nijmegen breakage syndrome 657del5 mutation in the NBN gene. Targeted treatment with sunitinib, the PDGFRbeta inhibitor, plus low dose vinblastine led to an unexpected and durable response without toxicities or limitations to daily life activities. The presence of the Slavic NBN gene mutation limited standard chemotherapy dosing due to severe toxicities. Sister of the patient suffred from skull base tumor with same genotype and histology. The same targeted therapy led to similar quick and durable response.; CONCLUSION: Progressive and resistant incurable infantile myofibromatosis can be successfully treated with the new approach described herein. Detailed insights into the biology of the patient's tumor and genome are necessary to understand the mechanisms of activity of less toxic and effective drugs except for up to date population-based chemotherapy regimens.

AB There is a great interest in developing biomarkers to enable precision medicine and improve health outcomes of patients with COPD. However, biomarker development is extremely challenging and expensive, and translation of research endeavors to date has been largely unsuccessful. In most cases, biomarkers fail because of poor replication of initial promising results in independent cohorts and/or inability to transfer the biomarker from a discovery platform to a clinical assay. Ultimately, new biomarker assays must address 5 questions for optimal clinical translation. They include the following: is the biomarker likely to be (1) superior (will the test outperform current standards?); (2) actionable (will the test change patient management?); (3) valuable (will the test improve patient outcomes?); (4) economical (will the implementation of the biomarker in the target population be cost-saving or cost-effective?); and (5) clinically deployable (is there a pathway for the biomarker and analytical technology to be implemented in a clinical laboratory?)? In this article we review some of the major barriers to biomarker development in COPD and provide possible solutions to overcome these limitations, enabling translation of promising biomarkers from discovery experiments to clinical implementation.

In this article, we present an approach to using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide systematic research that supports rapid-cycle evaluation of the implementation of health care delivery interventions and produces actionable evaluation findings intended to improve implementation in a timely manner.; METHODS: To present our approach, we describe a formative cross-case qualitative investigation of 21 primary care practices participating in the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative, a multi-payer supported primary care practice transformation intervention led by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Qualitative data include observational field notes and semi-structured interviews with primary care practice leadership, clinicians, and administrative and medical support staff. We use intervention-specific codes, and CFIR constructs to reduce and organize the data to support cross-case analysis of patterns of barriers and facilitators relating to different CPC components.; RESULTS: Using the CFIR to guide data collection, coding, analysis, and reporting of findings supported a systematic, comprehensive, and timely understanding of barriers and facilitators to practice transformation. Our approach to using the CFIR produced actionable findings for improving implementation effectiveness during this initiative and for identifying improvements to implementation strategies for future practice transformation efforts.; CONCLUSIONS: The CFIR is a useful tool for guiding rapid-cycle evaluation of the implementation of practice transformation initiatives. Using the approach described here, we systematically identified where adjustments and refinements to the intervention could be made in the second year of the 4-year intervention. We think the approach we describe has broad application and encourage others to use the CFIR, along with intervention-specific codes, to guide the efficient and rigorous analysis of rich qualitative data.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02318108.

AB Background: Hereditary cancer panels (HCPs), testing for multiple genes and syndromes, are rapidly transforming cancer risk assessment but are controversial and lack formal insurance coverage. We aimed to identify payers' perspectives on barriers to HCP coverage and opportunities to address them. Comprehensive cancer risk assessment is highly relevant to the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), and payers' considerations could inform PMI's efforts. We describe our findings and discuss them in the context of PMI priorities. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 major US payers, covering >160 million lives. We used the framework approach of qualitative research to design, conduct, and analyze interviews, and used simple frequencies to further describe findings. Results: Barriers to HCP coverage included poor fit with coverage frameworks (100%); insufficient evidence (100%); departure from pedigree/family history-based testing toward genetic screening (91%); lacking rigor in the HCP hybrid research/clinical setting (82%); and patient transparency and involvement concerns (82%). Addressing barriers requires refining HCP-indicated populations (82%); developing evidence of actionability (82%) and pathogenicity/penetrance (64%); creating infrastructure and standards for informing and recontacting patients (45%); separating research from clinical use in the hybrid clinical-research setting (44%); and adjusting coverage frameworks (18%). Conclusions: Leveraging opportunities suggested by payers to address HCP coverage barriers is essential to ensure patients' access to evolving HCPs. Our findings inform 3 areas of the PMI: addressing insurance coverage to secure access to future PMI discoveries; incorporating payers' evidentiary requirements into PMI's research agenda; and leveraging payers' recommendations and experience to keep patients informed and involved.

AB ALK, ROS1 and RET gene fusions are important predictive biomarkers for tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer. Currently, the gold standard method for gene fusion detection is Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and while highly sensitive and specific, it is also labour intensive, subjective in analysis, and unable to screen a large numbers of gene fusions. Recent developments in high-throughput transcriptome-based methods may provide a suitable alternative to FISH as they are compatible with multiplexing and diagnostic workflows. However, the concordance between these different methods compared with FISH has not been evaluated. In this study we compared the results from three transcriptome-based platforms (Nanostring Elements, Agena LungFusion panel and ThermoFisher NGS fusion panel) to those obtained from ALK, ROS1 and RET FISH on 51 clinical specimens. Overall agreement of results ranged from 86-96% depending on the platform used. While all platforms were highly sensitive, both the Agena panel and Thermo Fisher NGS fusion panel reported minor fusions that were not detectable by FISH. Our proof-of-principle study illustrates that transcriptome-based analyses are sensitive and robust methods for detecting actionable gene fusions in lung cancer and could provide a robust alternative to FISH testing in the diagnostic setting.

AB OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based guideline recommendations through a systematic review of the literature to establish standard molecular biomarker testing of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues to guide epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies and conventional chemotherapy regimens.; METHODS: The American Society for Clinical Pathology, College of American Pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based guideline to establish standard molecular biomarker testing and guide therapies for patients with CRC. A comprehensive literature search that included more than 4,000 articles was conducted.; RESULTS: Twenty-one guideline statements were established.; CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports mutational testing for EGFR signaling pathway genes, since theyprovide clinically actionable information as negative predictors of benefit to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapies for targeted therapy of CRC. Mutations in several of the biomarkers have clear prognostic value. Laboratory approaches to operationalize CRC molecular testing are presented.

AB Establishing ERBB2 [human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)] amplification status in breast and gastric carcinomas is essential to treatment selection. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) constitute the current standard for assessment. With further advancements in genomic medicine, new clinically relevant biomarkers are rapidly emerging and options for targeted therapy are increasing in patients with advanced disease, driving the need for comprehensive molecular profiling. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an attractive approach for up-front comprehensive assessment, including ERBB2 status, but the concordance with traditional methods of HER2 assessment is not well established. The Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay, a hybrid capture-based NGS assay interrogating the coding regions of 410 cancer-related genes, was performed on manually macrodissected unstained sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast (n=213) and gastroesophageal (n=39) tumors submitted for clinical mutation profiling. ERBB2 status was assessed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline, and NGS results were compared to IHC and FISH. NGS ERBB2 amplification calls had an overall concordance of 98.4% (248/252) with the combined IHC/FISH results in this validation set. Discrepancies occurred in the context of low tumor content and HER2 heterogeneity. ERBB2 amplification status can be reliably determined by hybridization capture-based NGS methods, allowing efficient concurrent testing for other potentially actionable genomic alterations, particularly in limited material.

AB Infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are increasingly reported across the planet, and drug-resistant bacteria are recognized to be a major threat to public health and modern medicine. In this review, we discuss how whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based approaches can contribute to the surveillance of the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. We outline the characteristics of sequencing technologies that are currently most used for WGS (Illumina short-read technologies and the long-read sequencing platforms developed by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore). The challenges posed by the analysis of sequencing data sets for antimicrobial-resistance determinants and the solutions offered by modern bioinformatics tools are discussed. Finally, we illustrate the power of WGS-based surveillance of antimicrobial resistance by summarizing recent studies on the spread of the multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae and the transferable colistin-resistance gene mcr-1, in which high-throughput WGS analyses played essential roles. The implementation of WGS for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is technically feasible and cost effective and provides actionable results with reference to infection control. Consequently, the time has come for laboratories to implement routine genome sequencing as part of their surveillance programs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. © 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB The MET proto-oncogene plays crucial roles in cell growth and proliferation, survival and apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, potentially conditioning the development and progression of the carcinogenesis process. The MET-associated aberrant signaling could be triggered by a variety of mechanisms, such as mutations, gene amplification, increased gene copy number and Met/HGF protein expression. Among the various MET alterations, MET exon 14 splicing abnormalities, causing the loss of the Met juxtamembrane (JM) domain, recently emerged as a new potential oncogenic driver and have been identified and validated across different cancer and histology subtypes. Moreover, this aberration was found to be mutually exclusive with other recognized drivers, thus strongly nominating its potential oncogenic role. Recently, the clinical activity of anti-Met-targeted therapy was demonstrated particularly in patients harboring MET exon 14 skipping lung cancer, resulting in a renewed enthusiasm to further test MET precision therapy in prospective trials. In this review, the key preclinical and clinical data regarding MET exon 14 skipping splicing variants as an actionable genomic aberration in cancer are described, and the perspectives deriving from the validation of such alteration as a potential target, which may further allow driving the therapeutic approach in this molecularly selected patients' subgroup, are explored.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Large healthcare databases, which contain data collected during routinely delivered healthcare to patients, can serve as a valuable resource for generating actionable evidence to assist medical and healthcare policy decision-making. In this review, we summarize use of large healthcare databases in rheumatology clinical research.; RECENT FINDINGS: Large healthcare data are critical to evaluate medication safety and effectiveness in patients with rheumatologic conditions. Three major sources of large healthcare data are: first, electronic medical records, second, health insurance claims, and third, patient registries. Each of these sources offers unique advantages, but also has some inherent limitations. To address some of these limitations and maximize the utility of these data sources for evidence generation, recent efforts have focused on linking different data sources. Innovations such as randomized registry trials, which aim to facilitate design of low-cost randomized controlled trials built on existing infrastructure provided by large healthcare databases, are likely to make clinical research more efficient in coming years.; SUMMARY: Harnessing the power of information contained in large healthcare databases, while paying close attention to their inherent limitations, is critical to generate a rigorous evidence-base for medical decision-making and ultimately enhancing patient care.

AB There is a paucity of information on the risk from potable water in non-passenger merchant vessels (NPMVs) particularly with regard to Legionella and other bacteria. This retrospective study examined water samples from 550 NPMVs docked in eight UK ports. A total of 1027 samples from 412 NPMVs were examined for total aerobic colony counts (ACC), coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci; 41% of samples yielded ACC above the action level (>1 * 103 c.f.u./ml) and 4·5% contained actionable levels (>1 c.f.u./100 ml) of faecal indicator bacteria. Eight hundred and three samples from 360 NPMVs were cultured specifically for Legionella and 58% of vessels proved positive for these organisms with 27% of samples showing levels greater than the UK upper action limit of 1 * 103 c.f.u./l. Cabin showers (49%) and hospital shower (45%) were frequently positive. A subset of 106 samples was analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for Legionella and identified a further 11 Legionella-positive NPMVs, returning a negative predictive value of 100%. There was no correlation between NPMV age or size and any microbial parameters (P > 0·05). Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from 46% of NPMVs and sequence-based typing of 17 isolates revealed four sequence types (STs) previously associated with human disease. These data raise significant concerns regarding the management of microbial and Legionella risks on board NPMVs and suggest that better guidance and compliance are required to improve control.

AB The checkpoint protein programmed cell death ligand-1 protein (PD-L1) binds to its receptor (PD-1) activating the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, an important therapeutic target. There is limited information regarding PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in thymic lesions. Sections from nonneoplastic thymi (n = 20), thymomas World Health Organization types A, AB, B1, B2, and B3 (n = 38) and thymic squamous cell carcinoma (n = 8) were stained for PD-L1 (clone SP142; Spring BioScience), PD-1 (MRQ22; Cell Marque), CD4 (clone SPO32; Cell Marque), and CD8 (JCB117; Ventana). Immunoreactivity for each antibody was classified as focal or diffuse and scored as follows: 0, negative; 1%-5%, 1+; 6%-20%, 2+; and >20%, 3+. The proportions of cases expressing PD-L1, PD-1, CD4, and C8 at score ≥1+ were compared by diagnosis, using chi2 statistics. PD-L1 was expressed in 90% of nonneoplastic thymi, 92% of thymomas, and 50% of carcinomas, with significantly higher scores (P < .01) in B2 and B3 thymomas and carcinomas than in AB and B1 thymomas; PD-L1 was diffuse in most B2 and B3 thymomas and focal in carcinomas. PD-1 was focally expressed, and mostly with scores 1+, in 55% of nonneoplastic thymi, 63% of thymomas, and 37.5% of carcinomas. CD4+ and CD8+ cells were diffusely distributed with scores 3+ in all lesions other than B3 thymomas and carcinomas. The latter showed CD4+ cells mostly at the interface between neoplastic cells and stroma. PD-L1 and PD-1 are not expressed in similar locations and cellular proportions in thymic lesions, raising a question as to whether the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway is an actionable therapeutic target in these lesions.

AB Purpose The purpose of this research study was to obtain healthcare executives' perspectives on diversity in executive healthcare leadership. The study focused on identifying perspectives about diversity and its potential impact on the access of healthcare services by people of color. The study also identified perspectives about factors that influence the attainment of executive healthcare roles by people of color. Design/methodology/approach A convenience sample of healthcare executives was obtained. The executives identified themselves as belonging to one of two subgroups, White healthcare executives or executives of color. Participants were interviewed telephonically in a semi-structured format. The interviews were transcribed and entered into a qualitative software application. The data were codified and important themes were identified. Findings The majority of the study participants perceive that diversity of the executive healthcare leadership team is important. There were differences in perspective among the subgroups as it relates to solutions to improve access to healthcare by people of color. There were also differences in perspective among the subgroups, as it relates to explaining the underrepresentation of people of color in executive healthcare leadership roles. Research limitations/implications This research effort benefited from the subject matter expertise of 24 healthcare executives from two states. Expansion of the number of survey participants and broadening the geographical spread of where participants were located may have yielded more convergence and/or more divergence in perspectives about key topics. Practical implications The findings from this research study serve to add to the existing body of literature on diversity in executive healthcare leadership. The findings expand on the importance of key elements in contemporary literature such as diversity, cultural competency and perspectives about the need for representation of people of color in leadership roles that guide healthcare policy and access. This study connects contemporary literature to perspectives of executives in the field and offers practical solutions to improving the representation of people of color in executive healthcare leadership roles. Social implications The recommendations offered as a result of this research effort serve to create awareness of the challenges that people of color face in career attainment. Although the process of increasing the representation of people of color in executive healthcare leadership will be a complex task that will involve a number of players over the course of several years, this study serves to provide a practical roadmap with actionable tactics that can be deployed. Originality/value This paper is an extension of the work that was done by the author during the course of completing the program requirements for the author's doctoral program. The findings were previously discussed in the author's dissertation. The value of these findings is significant because they validate some of the topics in contemporary literature with the perspectives of practicing healthcare executives. This study is also unique from other studies in that it offers a long-term plan to increase the representation of people of color in executive roles by creating an early disposition toward executive level roles and identifies a number of practical steps toward that end.

AB Anorectal melanoma is a rare disease that carries a poor prognosis. To date, limited genetic analyses confirmed KIT mutations as a recurrent genetic event similar to other mucosal melanomas, occurring in up to 30% of anorectal melanomas. Importantly, a subset of tumors harboring activating KIT mutations have been found to respond to c-Kit inhibitor-based therapy, with improved patient survival at advanced tumor stages. We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series. Furthermore, we identify SF3B1 mutations as a recurrent genetic event in mucosal melanomas. Our findings provide an insight into the genetic diversity of anorectal melanomas, and suggest significant potential for alternative targeted therapeutics in addition to c-Kit inhibitors for this melanoma subtype.

AB Pancancer studies have identified many genes that are frequently somatically altered across multiple tumour types, suggesting that pathway-targeted therapies can be deployed across diverse cancers. However, the same 'actionable mutation' impacts distinct context-specific gene regulatory programs and signalling networks-and interacts with different genetic backgrounds of co-occurring alterations-in different cancers. Here we apply a computational strategy for integrating parallel (phospho)proteomic and mRNA sequencing data across 12 TCGA tumour data sets to interpret the context-specific impact of somatic alterations in terms of functional signatures such as (phospho)protein and transcription factor (TF) activities. Our analysis predicts distinct dysregulated transcriptional regulators downstream of somatic alterations in different cancers, and we validate the context-specific differential activity of TFs associated to mutant PIK3CA in isogenic cancer cell line models. These results have implications for the pancancer use of targeted drugs and potentially for the design of combination therapies.

AB Development of brain metastasis (BM) portends a dismal prognosis for patients with cancer. Melanomas and carcinomas of the lung, breast, and kidney are the most common malignancies to metastasize to the brain. Recent advances in molecular genetics have enabled the identification of actionable, clinically relevant genetic alterations within primary tumors and their corresponding metastases. Adoption of genotype-guided treatment strategies for the management of systemic malignancy has resulted in dramatic and durable responses. Unfortunately, despite these therapeutic advances, central nervous system (CNS) relapses are not uncommon. Although these relapses have historically been attributed to limited blood brain barrier penetration of anti-neoplastic agents, recent work has demonstrated genetic heterogeneity such that metastatic sites, including BM, harbor relevant genetic alterations that are not present in primary tumor biopsies. This improved insight into molecular mechanisms underlying site specific recurrences can inform strategies for targeting these oncogenic drivers. Thus, development of rational, genomically guided CNS-penetrant therapies is crucial for ongoing therapeutic success. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Whilst qPCR provides an extremely powerful tool for genetic analysis, some applications such as multiplexing variant alleles (eg SNPs, point mutations or deletions), remain challenging using current primer/probe systems. The novel design features of PlexPrimers allow sensitive, multiplexed analysis of variant alleles even when these are tightly clustered.; METHOD: PlexPrimers were combined with PlexZymes in qPCR assays for the detection of SNPs in human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) genes; clustered mutations in the 23S rRNA gene which confer antibiotic resistance to Mycoplasma genitalium; and deletions within the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.; RESULTS: The combination of PlexPrimers and PlexZymes allowed robust multiplexing of targets which resulted in 100% concordance with results obtained using hydrolysis probe kits for 14 SNPs in the ADME genes. A 7-plex qPCR assay targeting M. genitalium, 5 clustered mutations associated with macrolide resistance and an internal control, allowed efficient amplification of all targets, with all 5 mutations detected in a single channel. Finally, the strategy was employed to analyse common EGFR mutants with high sensitivity, detecting deletions present at only 0.01%.; CONCLUSION: PlexPrime is a novel technology for the detection of genetic variants. Unlike previous strategies, the combination of PlexPrimers with PlexZymes enables both allele-specific detection and allele-specific amplification in qPCR. The study demonstrated highly sensitive and specific detection of mutations and SNPs, and superior multiplexing capacity. The ability to multiplex clustered genetic variants reduces the time to result providing more actionable information.

AB Concerns about opioid-related adverse events, including overdose, prompted the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to launch an Opioid Safety Initiative and Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution program. To mitigate risks associated with opioid prescribing, a holistic approach that takes into consideration both risk factors (e.g., dose, substance use disorders) and risk mitigation interventions (e.g., urine drug screening, psychosocial treatment) is needed. This article describes the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM), a tool developed in VHA that reflects this holistic approach and facilitates patient identification and monitoring. STORM prioritizes patients for review and intervention according to their modeled risk for overdose/suicide-related events and displays risk factors and risk mitigation interventions obtained from VHA electronic medical record (EMR)-data extracts. Patients' estimated risk is based on a predictive risk model developed using fiscal year 2010 (FY2010: 10/1/2009-9/30/2010) EMR-data extracts and mortality data among 1,135,601 VHA patients prescribed opioid analgesics to predict risk for an overdose/suicide-related event in FY2011 (2.1% experienced an event). Cross-validation was used to validate the model, with receiver operating characteristic curves for the training and test data sets performing well (>.80 area under the curve). The predictive risk model distinguished patients based on risk for overdose/suicide-related adverse events, allowing for identification of high-risk patients and enrichment of target populations of patients with greater safety concerns for proactive monitoring and application of risk mitigation interventions. Results suggest that clinical informatics can leverage EMR-extracted data to identify patients at-risk for overdose/suicide-related events and provide clinicians with actionable information to mitigate risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) can be difficult to diagnose, even when newborn screening (NBS) tests yield positive results. This challenge is exacerbated by the multitude of NBS protocols, misunderstandings about screening vs diagnostic tests, and the lack of guidelines for presumptive diagnoses. There is also confusion regarding the designation of age at diagnosis.; STUDY DESIGN: To improve diagnosis and achieve standardization in definitions worldwide, the CF Foundation convened a committee of 32 experts with a mission to develop clear and actionable consensus guidelines on diagnosis of CF with an emphasis on screened populations, especially the newborn population. A comprehensive literature review was performed with emphasis on relevant articles published during the past decade.; RESULTS: After reviewing the common screening protocols and outcome scenarios, 14 of 27 consensus statements were drafted that apply to screened populations. These were approved by 80% or more of the participants.; CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that all diagnoses be established by demonstrating dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, initially with a sweat chloride test and, when needed, potentially with newer methods assessing membrane transport directly, such as intestinal current measurements. Even in babies with 2 CF-causing mutations detected via NBS, diagnosis must be confirmed by demonstrating CFTR dysfunction. The committee also recommends that the latest classifications identified in the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR project [http://www.cftr2.org/index.php] should be used to aid with CF diagnosis. Finally, to avoid delays in treatment, we provide guidelines for presumptive diagnoses and recommend how to determine the age of diagnosis. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The tools of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, such as targeted sequencing of candidate cancer genes and whole-exome and -genome sequencing, coupled with encouraging clinical results based on the use of targeted therapeutics and biomarker-guided clinical trials, are fueling further technological advancements of NGS technology. However, NGS data interpretation is associated with challenges that must be overcome to promote the techniques' effective integration into clinical oncology practice. Specifically, sequencing of a patient's tumor often yields 30-65 somatic variants, but most of these variants are "passenger" mutations that are phenotypically neutral and thus not targetable. Therefore, NGS data must be interpreted by multidisciplinary decision-support teams to determine mutation actionability and identify potential "drivers," so that the treating physician can prioritize what clinical decisions can be pursued in order to provide cancer therapy that is personalized to the patient and his or her unique genome.

AB Many of the studies in the spine surgical literature using national databases have been directed at examining adverse events, readmission rates, cost, and risk factors for poorer outcomes. Although such studies allow for assessment of large cohorts taken from multiple institutions, they are limited by data collection methods, short-term follow-up, and minimal assessment of functional outcomes. Furthermore, few studies are directed at producing actionable practice changes to improve patient care. Recent work aimed at producing databases with more relevance to spine surgery represent exciting developments to the rapidly growing field of health outcomes research.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Approximately, one quarter of patients discharged after a hospitalization for decompensated cirrhosis will be readmitted within 30days. These readmissions have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, can be financially harmful to the health system, and may be partially preventable. This review summarizes the literature on readmissions, providing clinicians with tools for risk prediction and a taxonomy for preventative interventions.; RECENT FINDINGS: Readmission strategies can be categorized according to complexity (simple versus complex) and specificity (focused versus broad). The literature thus far provides the following generalizable inferences: 1) Interventions should be integrated in the clinical workflow, 2) default options are more powerful than voluntary actions, 3) knowledge improvement should focus on the front line clinicians, 4) process improvements do not always translate into better outcomes, and 5) any successful intervention must include viable alternatives to hospitalization. A growing body of literature provides concrete and actionable guidance for interventions to reduce readmissions in patients with cirrhosis.

AB Prostate tumours are highly variable in their response to therapies, but clinically available prognostic factors can explain only a fraction of this heterogeneity. Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset. These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers. We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized prostate cancer may improve cure rates.

AB BACKGROUND: Whole genome array testing not only provides an increased diagnostic yield of pathogenic causative findings, but it may also reveal so called susceptibility loci (SL) for neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes in SL cases and to establish a protocol for pregnancy management, follow-up and additional investigations.; METHODS: Fifty seven cases were evaluated: 34 with and 23 without ultrasound anomalies at referral. Each pregnant couple received pretest counseling and extensive posttest genetic counseling.; RESULTS: After diagnosis of SL, parental testing and an additional ultrasound examination were offered. The severity of the ultrasound anomalies and not the diagnosis of SL was the most important factor contributing to the decision on pregnancy continuation. In the majority of cases with milder or no ultrasound anomalies, the pregnancy was continued and a normal outcome after birth was observed.; CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of a SL did not seem to be a reason for termination of pregnancy. Most patients were able to cope with the uncertainty and were interested in both prenatal and postnatal actionability of SL. Long-term follow-up is crucial to assess the actual risks for neurodevelopmental disorders, especially in families with unremarkable history. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular testing of lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs) is crucial for therapy stratification of patients. Because of the often limited diagnostic material, the authors aimed to explore the suitability of cytology smears for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and compared the results with concurrent histological specimens or cell blocks.; METHODS: A total of 16 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ADCs with known genetic alterations were used as the first cohort for targeted DNA and RNA sequencing. In the second cohort of 8 cases, 8 cytological smears were compared with matching histological specimens or cell blocks for the study. For NGS library amplification, commercially available panels for DNA and RNA sequencing were applied. The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and the Ion Reporter workflow (version 5.0) were used for sequencing.; RESULTS: All DNA libraries derived from FFPE and non-formalin-fixed cytological smear samples produced acceptable quality metrics, thereby enabling successful targeted DNA sequencing (100% performance). Targeted RNA sequencing failed in 1 FFPE case and 1 cytology probe by not reaching enough mapped fusion reads (92% performance rate). All previously detected mutations and gene rearrangements could be confirmed (sensitivity of 100%), whereas specificity of the DNA-based NGS assay reached 96%.; CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated the suitability of non-formalin cytology specimens for the simultaneous NGS testing of lung ADCs using amplicon resequencing panels. These assays allowed for the input of cytological smears equal to concurrent histology or cell blocks and proved to be accurate in the detection of therapeutically actionable somatic mutations and gene rearrangements.

AB A major outcome of the current health care reform process is the move away from unrestricted fee-for-service payment models toward those that are based on the delivery of better patient value and outcomes. The authors' purpose, therefore, is to critically evaluate and define those components of the overall imaging enterprise that deliver meaningful value to both patients and referrers and to determine how these components might be measured and quantified. These metrics might then be used to lobby providers and payers for sustainable payment solutions for radiologists and radiology services. The authors evaluated radiology operations and services using the framework of the imaging value chain, which divides radiology service into a number of discrete value-added activities, which ultimately deliver the primary product, most often the actionable report for diagnostic imaging or an effective outcome for interventional radiology. These value activities include scheduling and imaging appropriateness and stewardship, patient preparation, protocol design, modality operations, reporting, report communication, and clinical follow-up (eg, mammography reminder letters). Two further categories are hospital or health care organization citizenship and examination outcome. Each is discussed in turn, with specific activities highlighted.

AB Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-associated hemangioblastomas (VHL-HB) arise in the central nervous system (CNS), and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in VHL disease. Currently, surgical resection is the most effective way to manage symptomatic VHL-HBs. Surgically unresectable VHL-HBs or those in frail patients are challenging problems. Therapies targeting oncologic and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways have failed to demonstrate tumor control. Our experience and previous reports on VHL-HB avidity to somatostatin analogues suggested somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression in VHL-HBs, offering an alternative therapeutic strategy. We explored this possibility by demonstrating consistent histologic expression of SSTR1, 2a, 4, and 5 in VHL-HBs. We found that somatostatin analogue octreotide induces apoptosis in VHL-HB stromal cells in a dose-dependent fashion by BAX - caspase-3 pathway unrelated to canonical VHL pathway. When administered to a patient with unresectable symptomatic suprasellar hemangioblastoma, octreotide resulted in tumor volume reduction, symptom stabilization, and tumor cytopenia on repeat 68Ga-DOTA-TATE positron emission tomography (PET) within 6 months, suggesting tumor infarction. We conclude that VHL-HBs harbor multiple SSTR subtypes that offer actionable chemo-therapeutic strategy for management of symptomatic, unresectable tumors by somatostatin analogue therapy.

AB The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a promising framework for the redesign of primary care and more recently specialty care. As defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the PCMH framework has 5 attributes: comprehensive care, patient-centered care, coordinated care, accessible services, and quality and safety. Evidence increasingly demonstrates that for the PCMH to best achieve the Triple Aim (improved outcomes, decreased cost, and enhanced patient experience), treatment for behavioral health (including mental health, substance use, and life stressors) must be integrated as a central tenet. However, challenges to implementing the PCMH framework are compounded for real-world practitioners because payment reform rarely happens concurrently. Nowhere is this more evident than in attempts to integrate behavioral health clinicians into primary care. As behavioral health clinicians find opportunities to work in integrated settings, a comprehensive understanding of payment models is integral to the dialogue. This article describes alternatives to the traditional fee for service (FFS) model, including modified FFS, pay for performance, bundled payments, and global payments (i.e., capitation). We suggest that global payment structures provide the best fit to enable and sustain integrated behavioral health clinicians in ways that align with the Triple Aim. Finally, we present recommendations that offer specific, actionable steps to achieve payment reform, complement PCMH, and support integration efforts through policy.

AB The perfect method to discover and validate actionable somatic variants in cancer has not yet been developed, yet significant progress has been made toward this goal. There have been huge increases in the throughput and cost of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing technologies that have led to the burgeoning possibility of using sequencing data in clinical settings. Discovery of somatic mutations is relatively simple and has been improved recently due to laboratory methods optimization, bioinformatics algorithms development, and the expansion of various databases of population genomic information. Tiered systems of evidence evaluation are currently being used to classify genomic variants for clinicians to more rapidly and accurately determine actionability of these aberrations. These efforts are complicated by the intricacies of communicating sequencing results to physicians and supporting its biological relevance, emphasizing the need for increasing education of clinicians and administrators, and the ongoing development of ethical standards for dealing with incidental results. This chapter will focus on general aspects of DNA and RNA tumor sequencing technologies, data analysis and interpretation, assessment of biological and clinical relevance of genomic aberrations, ethical aspects of germline sequencing, and how these factors impact cancer personalized care. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: In recent years, obesity-related diseases have been on the rise globally resulting in major challenges for health systems and society as a whole. Emerging research in population health suggests that interventions targeting the built environment may help reduce the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, translation of the evidence on the built environment into effective policy and planning changes requires engagement and collaboration between multiple sectors and government agencies for designing neighborhoods that are more conducive to healthy and active living. In this study, we identified knowledge gaps and other barriers to evidence-based decision-making and policy development related to the built environment; as well as the infrastructure, processes, and mechanisms needed to drive policy changes in this area.; METHODS: We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of data collected through consultations with a broad group of stakeholders (N=42) from Southern Ontario, Canada, within various sectors (public health, urban planning, and transportation) and levels of government (federal, provincial, and municipalities). Relevant themes were classified based on the specific phase of the knowledge-to-action cycle (research, translation, and implementation) in which they were most closely aligned.; RESULTS: We identified 5 themes including: 1) the need for policy-informed and actionable research (e.g. health economic analyses and policy evaluations); 2) impactful messaging that targets all relevant sectors to create the political will necessary to drive policy change; 3) common measures and tools to increase capacity for monitoring and surveillance of built environment changes; (4) intersectoral collaboration and alignment within and between levels of government to enable collective actions and provide mechanisms for sharing of resources and expertise, (5) aligning public and private sector priorities to generate public demand and support for community action; and, (6) solution-focused implementation of research that will be tailored to meet the needs of policymakers and planners. Additional research priorities and key policy and planning actions were also noted.; CONCLUSION: Our research highlights the necessity of involving stakeholders in identifying inter-sectoral solutions to develop and translate actionable research on the built environment into effective policy and planning initiatives.

AB The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 72-year-old man with a 40-pack-year tobacco history developed a cough and decreased exercise tolerance. A chest x-ray demonstrated a right-upper-lobe opacity. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2.5-cm mass in the right upper lobe with multiple mediastinal lymph node disease ( Fig 1 ). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed the lung lesion and the mediastinal lymphadenopathy without distant metastases. Brain magnetic resonance imaging results were negative. The biopsy specimen revealed adenocarcinoma with no actionable mutations present. Cervical mediastinoscopy was positive for carcinoma in level 2, 3, 4R, and 7 lymph nodes; level 4L was negative. The patient's stage was T1bN2M0, stage IIIA. His medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. He had smoked one pack a day for 40 years and had quit 15 years earlier. Physical examination was unrevealing, and the patient had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0. Because of the extent of lung cancer in the mediastinum, the patient's cancer was deemed inoperable, and he was referred for consideration of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation.

AB The advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a significant stride forward in our ability to better understand the glycemic status of our patients. Current clinical practice employs two forms of CGM: professional (retrospective or "masked") and personal (real-time) to evaluate and/or monitor glycemic control. Most studies using professional and personal CGM have been done in those with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, this technology is agnostic to the type of diabetes and can also be used in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The value of professional CGM in T2D for physicians, patients, and researchers is derived from its ability to: (1) to discover previously unknown hyper- and hypoglycemia (silent and symptomatic); (2) measure glycemic control directly rather than through the surrogate metric of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) permitting the observation of a wide variety of metrics that include glycemic variability, the percent of time within, below and above target glucose levels, the severity of hypo- and hyperglycemia throughout the day and night; (3) provide actionable information for healthcare providers derived by the CGM report; (4) better manage patients on hemodialysis; and (5) effectively and efficiently analyze glycemic effects of new interventions whether they be pharmaceuticals (duration of action, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy), devices, or psycho-educational. Personal CGM has also been successfully used in a small number of studies as a behavior modification tool in those with T2D. This comprehensive review describes the differences between professional and personal CGM and the evidence for the use of each form of CGM in T2D. Finally, the opinions of key professional societies on the use of CGM in T2D are presented. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic determinants of drug response remain stable throughout life and offer great promise to patient-tailored drug therapy. The adoption of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing in patient care requires accurate, cost effective and rapid genotyping with clear guidance on the use of the results. Hence, we evaluated a 32 SNPs panel for implementing PGx testing in clinical laboratories.; METHODS: We designed a 32-SNP panel for PGx testing in clinical laboratories. The variants were selected using the clinical annotations of the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and include polymorphisms of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5 and VKORC1 genes. The CYP2D6 gene allele quantification was determined simultaneously with TaqMan copy number assays targeting intron 2 and exon 9 regions. The genotyping results showed high call rate accuracy according to concordance with genotypes identified by independent analyses on Sequenome massarray and droplet digital PCR. Furthermore, 506 genomic samples across three major ethnic groups of Singapore (Malay, Indian and Chinese) were analysed on our workflow.; RESULTS: We found that 98% of our study subjects carry one or more CPIC actionable variants. The major alleles detected include CYP2C9*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2D6*10, CYP2D6*36, CYP2D6*41, CYP3A5*3 and VKORC1*2. These translate into a high percentage of intermediate (IM) and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes for these genes in our population.; CONCLUSION: Genotyping may be useful to identify patients who are prone to drug toxicity with standard doses of drug therapy in our population. The simplicity and robustness of this PGx panel is highly suitable for use in a clinical laboratory.

AB Lung cancer is still considered a big killer among cancer diseases, due to high incidence and mortality rates. The newer frontiers of therapeutic development regard the discovery of oncogene driven tumours: however, the majority of NSCLC patients are wild type and they cannot be treated with targeted based agents. The recent positive results obtained with immunotherapy and with the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and docetaxel, changed the therapeutic scenario of the second line therapy of non squamous NSCLC without actionable mutations. A major issue is currently the lack of predictive biomarkers that could help the oncologists in the choice of the best second-line treatment. Aim of this project was to define an optimal therapeutic pathway for patients with non-squamous NSCLC, through a working group of a large number of Italian lung cancer oncologists. Panellists have identified and discussed the more significant criteria in the second-line setting for a therapeutic decision between the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors plus chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Finally, they expressed their preference on each criterion, building a proposal of a decision-making tree for a second-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing is revealing genomic heterogeneity in localized prostate cancer (CaP). Incomplete sampling of CaP multiclonality has limited the implications for molecular subtyping, stratification, and systemic treatment.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of genomic and transcriptomic diversity within and among intraprostatic CaP foci on CaP molecular taxonomy, predictors of progression, and actionable therapeutic targets.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Four consecutive patients with clinically localized National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- or high-risk CaP who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy underwent radical prostatectomy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in June-July 2014. Presurgical information on CaP content and a customized tissue procurement procedure were used to isolate nonmicroscopic and noncontiguous CaP foci in radical prostatectomy specimens. Three cores were obtained from the index lesion and one core from smaller lesions. RNA and DNA were extracted simultaneously from 26 cores with ≥90% CaP content and analyzed using whole-exome sequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and RNA sequencing.; OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Somatic mutations, copy number alternations, gene expression, gene fusions, and phylogeny were defined. The impact of genomic alterations on CaP molecular classification, gene sets measured in Oncotype DX, Prolaris, and Decipher assays, and androgen receptor activity among CaP cores was determined.; RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There was considerable variability in genomic alterations among CaP cores, and between RNA- and DNA-based platforms. Heterogeneity was found in molecular grouping of individual CaP foci and the activity of gene sets underlying the assays for risk stratification and androgen receptor activity, and was validated in independent genomic data sets. Determination of the implications for clinical decision-making requires follow-up studies.; CONCLUSIONS: Genomic make-up varies widely among CaP foci, so care should be taken when making treatment decisions based on a single biopsy or index lesions.; PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the molecular composition of individual cancers in a patient's prostate. We found a lot of genetic diversity among these cancers, and concluded that information from a single cancer biopsy is not sufficient to guide treatment decisions.

AB The cornerstone of every health care profession is decision making. Historically, the decisions made by pharmacists have focused on ensuring the accuracy and physical integrity of the pharmaceutical product delivered to the patient in strict compliance with the prescriber's order. As the role of the pharmacist evolved over the past half century, the focus of decision making progressively shifted from a product-centric orientation to optimizing the interaction that occurs between the pharmaceutical product and the patient. Toward that end, prospective drug utilization review (pro-DUR) represents, perhaps, the quintessential expression of the pharmacist's contemporary clinical role. Fueled by evolving practice standards, innovations in information technology, and legal mandates such as The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, computer-assisted pro-DUR systems have become a ubiquitous component of pharmacy practice. While these data-driven clinical decision support systems have clearly demonstrated their ability to improve the quality and safety of medication delivery and use, they have yet to fully achieve their promised potential. Doing so will require recognition of continuing shortcomings and a shared commitment by all stakeholders to develop and adhere to best practice guidelines that will better ensure that alerts received by practitioners are valid, interpretable, clinically significant, and actionable.; DISCLOSURES: The authors received no funding for this article.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite being a rare disorder, hemophilia represents a significant driver of health care resource utilization and requires expert hematologic and multidisciplinary services to achieve optimal outcomes. Since their inception nearly 40 years ago, hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) have served as centers of excellence in providing the intensive care and ancillary services necessary for this unique patient base; however, the full capabilities of these centers may be underused in the current framework of managed care, largely because of a lack of communication and information shared between payers and HTC stakeholders.; PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In an effort to enact tangible change toward improving the quality of care for bleeding disorders, the National Hemophilia Foundation developed an ongoing initiative among 18 leading clinicians and managed care decision makers called the Comprehensive Care Sustainability Collaborative (CCSC). The primary aim of the CCSC is to develop a framework for quality improvement pilot programs that can be replicated across the United States between payers and HTCs to facilitate cost-effective hemophilia management by integrating the HTC comprehensive care model.; OBSERVATIONS: After CCSC committee members shared perspectives on care delivery, quality, and value, actionable data points were reviewed at length in order to develop meaningful metrics to facilitate information sharing between HTC and payer stakeholders. The following pragmatic measures will be reported by HTCs and payers via a series of pilot programs (reporting group is indicated in brackets): (a) patient classification by diagnosis (type, severity, and inhibitor status) [HTC]; (b) total cost of clotting factor [payer]; (c) prescribed factor dose/dispensed dose/patient weight (± range) [payer and HTC]; (d) emergency department visits/hospitalizations [payer and HTC]; (e) home infusion of clotting factor (%) [HTC]; (f) total cost per patient [payer]; and (g) patient contacts (e.g., clinic visits, follow-ups, telemedicine, and e-mail) [HTC].; IMPLICATIONS: Routine information sharing between HTCs and payer stakeholders is paramount to improving the quality and reducing the cost of hemophilia care, and the CCSC initiative provides a unique forum for such dialogue. Over the course of several consensus meetings, the CCSC has rigorously developed a set of quality improvement and cost management metrics. These metrics will be used in a first-of-its-kind series of pilot projects that are anticipated to forge innovative collaboration between payers and HTCs so as to improve outcomes in the management of bleeding disorders.; DISCLOSURES: The preparation of this article was funded as part of the Comprehensive Care Sustainability Collaborative (CCSC) initiative, which is jointly sponsored by the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and Impact Education, LLC, and supported via a charitable donation from Shire. Tarantino and Pindolia are members of the CCSC and were part of the NHF CCSC group that developed the metrics included in this article.

AB BACKGROUND: Injection-site vein loss and skin abscesses impose significant morbidity on people who inject drugs (PWID). The two common forms of street heroin available in the USA include black tar and powder heroin. Little research has investigated these different forms of heroin and their potential implications for health outcomes.; METHODS: A multiple-choice survey was administered to a sample of 145 participants seeking services at reduction facilities in both Sacramento, CA and greater Boston, MA, USA. Multivariate regression models for reporting one or more abscesses in one year, injection-site veins lost in six months, and soft tissue injection.; RESULTS: Participants in Sacramento exclusively used black tar (99%), while those in Boston used powder heroin (96%). Those who used black tar heroin lost more injection-site veins (beta=2.34, 95% CI: 0.66-4.03) and were more likely to report abscesses (AOR=7.68, 95% CI: 3.01-19.60). Soft tissue injection was also associated with abscesses (AOR=4.68, 95% CI: 1.84-11.93). Consistent venous access (AOR: 0.088, 95% CI: 0.011-0.74) and losing more injection sites (AOR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45) were associated with soft tissue injection.; CONCLUSION: Use of black tar heroin is associated with more frequent abscesses and more extensive vein loss. Poor venous access predisposes people who inject drugs to soft tissue injection, which may constitute a causal pathway between black tar heroin injection and abscess formation. The mechanisms by which black tar heroin contributes to vein loss and abscess formation must be further elucidated in order to develop actionable interventions for maintaining vein health and decreasing the abscess burden. Potential interventions include increased access to clean injection equipment and education, supervised injection facilities, opioid substitution therapy, and supply chain interventions targeting cutting agents.

AB Precision medicine continues to be the benchmark to which we strive in cancer research. Seeking out actionable aberrations that can be selectively targeted by drug compounds promises to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize toxicity. Utilizing these different targeted agents in combination or in sequence may further delay resistance to treatments and prolong antitumor responses. Remarkable progress in the field of immunotherapy adds another layer of complexity to the management of cancer patients. Corresponding advances in companion biomarker development, novel methods of serial tumor assessments, and innovative trial designs act synergistically to further precision medicine. Ongoing hurdles such as clonal evolution, intra- and intertumor heterogeneity, and varied mechanisms of drug resistance continue to be challenges to overcome. Large-scale data-sharing and collaborative networks using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms promise to take us further into the cancer 'ome' than ever before, with the goal of achieving successful precision medicine.

AB OBJECTIVE: This essay discusses applying the Conceptual Framework for Patient and Family Engagement to partnerships with patients and consumers to increase their use of research evidence in healthcare decisions. The framework's foundational principles hold that engagement occurs on a continuum across all levels of healthcare-from direct care to policymaking-with patients and healthcare professionals working in full partnership and sharing responsibility for achieving a safe, high-quality, efficient, and patient-centered healthcare system.; DISCUSSION: Research evidence can serve as a critical decision-making tool in partnerships between patients and health professionals. However, as the framework suggests, without patient and consumer engagement in the design, planning, interpretation, and dissemination of research findings, it is unlikely that the broader consumer population will find research evidence useful, much less use it, to guide their healthcare decisions. Understanding what factors influence patient and consumer engagement can lead to effective strategies that enable meaningful partnerships between patients and researchers.; CONCLUSION: Understanding patient and consumer perspectives of research evidence is critical to engaging them in meaningful partnerships that produce actionable research findings that they can in turn use in partnership with health professionals to improve their own health and the healthcare system as a whole.

AB The development of genomic medicine has enabled us to perform contemporary clinical sequencing, while the acquisition of high-quality biospecimens and the appropriate handling of these materials are indispensable. We started Clinical Biobank, a novel system for on-demand-type banking, in 2014. During the 22 months from August 2014, we stored around 6,000 biospecimens from 1,700 patients, and most of them were obtained for diverse clinical research. The quality and amount of extracted DNA and RNA from PFPE samples were markedly high; thus, these samples are adequate for targeted amplicon sequencing using MiSeq (Illumina). In addition, we recently established the Division of Clinical Cancer Genetics for personalized cancer medicine. We obtain biospecimens including blood and tissue fixed using the PAXgene Tissue system, and the samples are immediately analyzed for targeted amplicon sequencing using MiSeq. The rest of the samples are stored after adequate procedures in a -80 degree freezer. We obtain DNA and RNA from PAX-fixed paraffin- embedded samples with a high quality and sufficient amounts for clinical sequencing after pathological evalua- tion. For three months, we examined 40 cancer patients and performed targeted exome sequencing. As a result, detection rates of actionable and druggable gene mutations were around 85 and 50%, respectively. We have also established the Clinical Biobank Study Group in Japan, collaborating with several universities and cancer centers. We believe that this novel biospecimen repository system will help to effectively estab- lish cancer clinical sequencing throughout Japan.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are a model for curable cancer because of exquisite chemosensitivity and incorporation of multimodal therapy. Nevertheless, our ability to predict metastases in early-stage disease and responders to chemotherapy in advanced disease is limited. Treatment options for cisplatin-resistant disease are sparse. A further understanding of TGCT biology may allow for more precise patient counseling and identify novel therapies in patients with cisplatin-resistant disease.; RECENT FINDINGS: Adult TGCTs are characterized by frequent chromosomal anomalies and low rates of somatic mutations. Large-scale integrated molecular analysis of early-stage TGCT patients is actively underway. In addition to ubiquitous gain of isochromosome 12p, current molecular studies have confirmed mutations of previously described genes (i.e., KIT and KRAS) and described novel mutations. Analysis of cisplatin-resistant cases has identified high rates of alterations within the TP53-MDM2 axis and a high proportion of patients with potentially actionable targets, including TP53-MDM2, PI3 kinase, and MAPK signaling pathway alterations. The role of epigenetics in TGCT development and prognosis is also being further characterized.; SUMMARY: Further molecular characterization of TGCT may allow for avoidance of unnecessary treatment in patients with early-stage disease and also provide new treatment options in patients with cisplatin-resistant disease.

AB Systems pharmacology aims to holistically understand mechanisms of drug actions to support drug discovery and clinical practice. Systems pharmacology modeling (SPM) is data driven. It integrates an exponentially growing amount of data at multiple scales (genetic, molecular, cellular, organismal, and environmental). The goal of SPM is to develop mechanistic or predictive multiscale models that are interpretable and actionable. The current explosions in genomics and other omics data, as well as the tremendous advances in big data technologies, have already enabled biologists to generate novel hypotheses and gain new knowledge through computational models of genome-wide, heterogeneous, and dynamic data sets. More work is needed to interpret and predict a drug response phenotype, which is dependent on many known and unknown factors. To gain a comprehensive understanding of drug actions, SPM requires close collaborations between domain experts from diverse fields and integration of heterogeneous models from biophysics, mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and semantic webs. This creates challenges in model management, model integration, model translation, and knowledge integration. In this review, we discuss several emergent issues in SPM and potential solutions using big data technology and analytics. The concurrent development of high-throughput techniques, cloud computing, data science, and the semantic web will likely allow SPM to be findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, reliable, interpretable, and actionable.

AB In interactive data analysis processes, the dialogue between the human and the computer is the enabling mechanism that can lead to actionable observations about the phenomena being investigated. It is of paramount importance that this dialogue is not interrupted by slow computational mechanisms that do not consider any known temporal human-computer interaction characteristics that prioritize the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of the users. In cases where the analysis involves an integrated computational method, for instance to reduce the dimensionality of the data or to perform clustering, such non-optimal processes are often likely. To remedy this, progressive computations, where results are iteratively improved, are getting increasing interest in visual analytics. In this paper, we present techniques and design considerations to incorporate progressive methods within interactive analysis processes that involve high-dimensional data. We define methodologies to facilitate processes that adhere to the perceptual characteristics of users and describe how online algorithms can be incorporated within these. A set of design recommendations and according methods to support analysts in accomplishing high-dimensional data analysis tasks are then presented. Our arguments and decisions here are informed by observations gathered over a series of analysis sessions with analysts from finance. We document observations and recommendations from this study and present evidence on how our approach contribute to the efficiency and productivity of interactive visual analysis sessions involving high-dimensional data.

AB The Rycroft-Malone paper states that co-production relies on 'authentic' collaboration as a context for action. Our commentary supports and extends this assertion. We suggest that 'authentic' co-production involves processes where participants can 'see' the difference that they have made within the project and beyond. We provide examples including: the use of design in health projects which seek to address power issues and make contributions visible through iteration and prototyping; and the development of 'actionable outputs' from research that are the physical embodiment of co-production. Finally, we highlight the elements of the Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) architecture that enables the inclusion of such collaborative techniques that demonstrate visible co-production. We reinforce the notion that maintaining collaboration requires time, flexible resources, blurring of knowledge producer-user boundaries, and leaders who promote epistemological tolerance and methodological exploration. © 2017 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

AB Purpose: Genomic testing has increased the quantity of information available to oncologists. Unfortunately, many identified sequence alterations are variants of unknown significance (VUSs), which thus limit the clinician's ability to use these findings to inform treatment. We applied a combination of in silico prediction and molecular modeling tools and laboratory techniques to rapidly define actionable VUSs.; Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing was conducted on 308 tumors from various origins. Most single nucleotide alterations within gene coding regions were VUSs. These VUSs were filtered to identify a subset of therapeutically targetable genes that were predicted with in silico tools to be altered in function by their variant sequence. A subset of receptor tyrosine kinase VUSs was characterized by laboratory comparison of each VUS versus its wild-type counterpart in terms of expression and signaling activity.; Results: The study identified 4,327 point mutations of which 3,833 were VUSs. Filtering for mutations in genes that were therapeutically targetable and predicted to affect protein function reduced these to 522VUSs of interest, including a large number of kinases. Ten receptortyrosine kinase VUSs were selected to explore in the laboratory. Of these, seven were found to be functionally altered. Three VUSs (FGFR2 F276C, FGFR4 R78H, and KDR G539R) showed increased basal or ligand-stimulated ERK phosphorylation compared with their wild-type counterparts, which suggests that they support transformation. Treatment of a patient who carried FGFR2 F276C with an FGFR inhibitor resulted in significant and sustained tumor response with clinical benefit.; Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the feasibility of rapid identification of the biologic relevance of somatic mutations, which thus advances clinicians' ability to make informed treatment decisions.

AB Purpose: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the lethal form of the disease. Many groups have performed mutational or immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing in metastatic CRPC to identify treatment targets. However, the frequency with which mutational or IHC data have an impact on clinical decision making and the outcomes of molecularly guided therapy in CRPC are largely unknown. We report our institution's experience with mutational and IHC testing in patients with metastatic CRPC and its impact on clinical decision making and patient outcomes.; Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 59 patients with CRPC underwent metastatic tissue biopsies and were genotyped with a 37-cancer gene panel in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory. PTEN expression by IHC testing was also measured in 35 of these samples. A retrospective chart review was performed to determine whether the genomic information was acted upon and the outcome of patients whose treatment was guided by molecular testing.; Results: Forty-six of 59 patients with CRPC (78.0%) had biopsies with adequate tumor for mutational testing. Thirty-one of 46 subjects (67.4%) had mutations identified by sequencing. Of the 35 patients with CRPC whose biopsies were evaluated for PTEN expression by IHC testing, 13 had PTEN loss. Two patients had treatment on the basis of molecular testing, and one of these subjects had greater tumor control with molecularly guided therapy than his immediate prior therapy.; Conclusion: Targeted sequencing and IHC can identify clinically informative molecular abnormalities in CRPC. Despite this, a small minority of patients in our series underwent therapies guided by mutational or IHC testing. Actionability of abnormalities identified in metastatic CRPC may be improved with access to clinical trials, insurance approval for unapproved uses of existing anticancer drugs, and larger gene sequencing panels that include more frequently mutated genes.

AB BACKGROUND/AIMS: A key issue in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) is early identification and prediction of disease progression. Clinical evaluation and imaging are limited due to the lack of sensitivity and disease indolence. We assessed the NETest as a predictive and prognostic marker of progression in a long-term follow-up study.; METHODS: GEP-NETs (n = 34) followed for a median 4 years (2.2-5.4) were evaluated. WHO tumor grade/stage grade 1: n = 17, grade 2: n = 14, grade 3: n = 1 (for 2, no grade was available); 31 (91%) were stage IV. Baseline and longitudinal imaging and blood biomarkers were available in all, and progression was defined per standard clinical protocols (RECIST 1.0). The NETest was measured by quantitative PCR of blood and multianalyte algorithmic analysis (disease activity scaled 0-100% with low <40% and high activity risk cutoffs >80%); chromogranin A (CgA) was measured by radioimmunoassay (normal <150 g/l); progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed by Cox proportional-hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.; RESULTS: At baseline, 100% were NETest positive, and CgA was elevated in 50%. The only baseline variable (Cox modeling) associated with PFS was NETest (hazard ratio = 1.022, 95% confidence interval = 1.005-1.04; p < 0.012). Using Kaplan-Meier analyses, the baseline NETest (>80%) was significantly associated (p = 0.01) with disease progression (median PFS 0.68 vs. 2.78 years with <40% levels). The NETest was more informative (96%) than CgA changes (<under>></under>25%) in consistently predicting disease alterations (40%, p < 2 * 10-5, chi2 = 18). The NETest had an earlier time point change than imaging (1.02 ± 0.15 years). Baseline NETest levels >40% in stable disease were 100% prognostic of disease progression versus CgA (chi2 = 5, p < 0.03). Baseline NETest values <40% accurately (100%) predicted stability over 5 years (p = 0.05, chi2 = 3.8 vs. CgA).; CONCLUSION: The NETest correlated with a well-differentiated GEP-NET clinical status. The NETest has predictive and prognostic utility for GEP-NETs identifying clinically actionable alterations 1 year before image-based evidence of progression. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective: To generate actionable insights for improving TB control in urban areas by describing the tuberculosis (TB) control activities of hospitals in five cities in Latin America.; Methods: A descriptive study of hospital-based TB control activities was conducted in 2013-2015 using a cross-sectional survey designed by the Pan American Health Organization and administered in Guatemala City, Guatemala; Guarulhos, Brazil; Bogota, Colombia; Lima, Peru; and Asuncion, Paraguay. Data were analyzed using Chi-squared, Fisher exact tests, and the Mantel-Haenszel test for Risk Ratios, as necessary (P < 0.05).; Results: While variation among cities existed, most hospitals (91.3%) conducted acid-fast bacilli smears for TB diagnosis and had a quality control process (94.0%), followed national TB guidelines (95%), and reported TB cases to the respective health authorities (96%). Additionally, TB treatment was offered free of charge almost universally (97.1%). However, only 74.2% of hospitals were supervised by the national or local TB programs; 52.8% followed up on the outcome of referrals; and 39.1% offered full ambulatory TB treatment, with 68.7% using Directly-Observed Therapy.; Conclusion: The study underscored strengths and weaknesses in specific areas for TB control activities in hospitals and highlighted the importance and complexity of coordinating efforts among private and public hospitals and the various stakeholders. Local TB programs and health authorities should use these results to enhance the quality of TB-related actions in hospitals in similar settings. 
A2 Objetivo: Generar informacion utilizable para mejorar el control de la

   hospitalarias de control de la tuberculosis mediante una encuesta
   transversal formulada por la Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud y
   administrada entre el 2013 y el 2015 en Ciudad de Guatemala (Guatemala),
   Guarulhos (Brasil), Bogota (Colombia), Lima (Peru) y Asuncion
   (Paraguay). Los datos fueron analizados con la prueba de la ji al
   cuadrado, la prueba exacta de Fisher y la prueba de asociacion de
   Mantel-Haenszel de las razones de riesgos, segun fuera necesario (P <
   0,05).Resultados: Pese a la variacion observada entre las ciudades, la
   mayor parte de los hospitales (91,3 %) realizan frotis de bacilos
   acidorresistentes para diagnosticar la tuberculosis y disponen de un
   proceso de control de la calidad (94,0 %), siguen las directrices
   nacionales respecto de la tuberculosis (95 %) y notifican los casos a
   las autoridades de salud respectivas (96 %). Ademas, casi todos ofrecen
   tratamiento antituberculoso gratuito (97,1 %). Sin embargo, solo el 74,2
   % de los hospitales esta supervisado por el programa nacional o local
   contra la tuberculosis; el 52,8 % hace el seguimiento de la evolucion de
   los pacientes derivados; y el 39,1 % ofrece tratamiento antituberculoso
   plenamente ambulatorio a los pacientes, del cual el 68,7 % corresponde
   al tratamiento bajo observacion directa.Conclusiones: En el estudio se
   ponen de relieve las fortalezas y las debilidades de aspectos
   especificos de las actividades hospitalarias de control de la
   tuberculosis, asi como la importancia y la complejidad que reviste
   coordinar los esfuerzos entre los hospitales privados y publicos y los
   diversos interesados directos. Los programas locales contra la
   tuberculosis y las autoridades de salud deben aprovechar estos
   resultados para mejorar la calidad de las actividades hospitalarias
   relacionadas con la tuberculosis en entornos similares.Objetivo:

AB Contemporary approaches to environmental research are calling for a type of scientific inquiry that is able to bring together the natural and social sciences. This with the aim to advance our understanding of environmental issues and produce synthetic and actionable knowledge meant to address these. Yet, interdisciplinarity research of this type is a demanding and challenging pursuit; many have shown that in certain thematic areas and geographic regions practice falls behind discourse. We bring together ideas about interdisciplinary research collaborations (after Patricia L. Rosenfield) and interdisciplinary epistemic synthesis (after Julie T. Klein) that are used to analyse a sample of research projects funded (from 2006 to 2013) by the Slovene Research Agency. We triangulated interview data (with principal investigators) with document analysis and integrated these with other secondary data. Our results suggest for the sample of environmental projects to be interdisciplinary in a narrow sense, this prevalently within natural and life sciences with little input from the humanities and social sciences. Also, the results obtained suggest that environmental research with unambiguous problem solving objectives is preferred over research with a high degree of abstraction, as involved in theoretical and conceptual work.

AB BACKGROUND: Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis (NSGCT) is largely curable. However, a small group of patients develop refractory disease. We investigated the hypothesis that intratumoral heterogeneity contributes to the emergence of chemoresistance and the development of refractory tumor subtypes.; RESULTS: Our institution's records for January 2000 through December 2010 included 275 patients whose primary tumor showed pure embryonal carcinoma (pure E); mixed embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma (EYT); or mixed embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, seminoma, and teratoma (EYST). Patients with EYST had the highest cancer-specific mortality rate (P = .001). They tended to undergo somatic transformation (P = .0007). Two of 5 patients with clinical stage I EYST who had developed recurrence during active surveillance died of their disease.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with the three most common histological phenotypes of NSGCT. Chemoresistance was defined as the presence of teratoma, viable germ cell tumor, or somatic transformation in the residual tumor or the development of progressive or relapsed disease after chemotherapy. In a separate prospective study, we performed next-generation sequencing on tumor samples from 39 patients to identify any actionable genetic mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with EYST in their primary tumor may harbor a potentially refractory NSGCT phenotype and are at increased risk of dying from disease. Despite intratumoral heterogeneity, improved patient selection and personalized care of distinct tumor subtypes may optimize the clinical outcome of patients with NSGCT.

AB The DiscovEHR collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics Center and Geisinger Health System couples high-throughput sequencing to an integrated health care system using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). We sequenced the exomes of 50,726 adult participants in the DiscovEHR study to identify ~4.2 million rare single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events, of which ~176,000 are predicted to result in a loss of gene function. Linking these data to EHR-derived clinical phenotypes, we find clinical associations supporting therapeutic targets, including genes encoding drug targets for lipid lowering, and identify previously unidentified rare alleles associated with lipid levels and other blood level traits. About 3.5% of individuals harbor deleterious variants in 76 clinically actionable genes. The DiscovEHR data set provides a blueprint for large-scale precision medicine initiatives and genomics-guided therapeutic discovery.

AB BACKGROUND: Advances in experimental biology have enabled the collection of enormous troves of data on genomic variation in living organisms. The interpretation of this data to extract actionable information is one of the keys to developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat complex diseases. Network organization of biological data overcomes measurement noise in several biological contexts. Does a network approach, combining information about the linear organization of genomic markers with correlative information on these markers in a Bayesian formulation, lead to an analytic method with higher power for detecting quantitative trait loci?; RESULTS: Block Network Mapping, combining Similarity Network Fusion (Wang et al., NM 11:333-337, 2014) with a Bayesian locus likelihood evaluation, leads to large improvements in area under the receiver operating characteristic and power over interval mapping with expectation maximization. The method has a monotonically decreasing false discovery rate as a function of effect size, unlike interval mapping.; CONCLUSIONS: Block Network Mapping provides an alternative data-driven approach to mapping quantitative trait loci that leverages correlations in the sampled genotypes. The evaluation methodology can be combined with existing approaches such as Interval Mapping. Python scripts are available at http://lbm.niddk.nih.gov/vipulp/ .

AB Leadership positions in global health are greatly skewed toward men; the imbalance is more pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The under-representation of women in leadership is a threat to gender equality, and also impacts the improvement of women's health outcomes globally. In this perspectives piece, we assert that the promotion and retention of women in global health leadership has a ripple effect that can achieve improvement in global health outcomes. We present pragmatic, actionable solutions to promote and retain female global health leaders in this field. 
A2 Les positions de dirigeant dans la sante du monde sont largement
   orientees vers les hommes et ce desequilibre est encore plus prononce
   dans les pays a revenu faible et moyen. La sous-representation des
   femmes en termes de dirigeant menace l'egalite des genres et a egalement
   un impact sur l'amelioration de l'etat de sante des femmes dans le
   monde. Dans cette perspective, nous affirmons que la promotion et la
   retention des femmes au sein du leadership de la sante dans le monde a
   un effet d'entrainement qui peut aboutir a une amelioration de l'etat de
   sante dans le monde. Nous presentons des solutions pragmatiques et
   realisables pour promouvoir et retenir des leaders feminins en matiere
   de sante dans le monde.Los puestos directivos en materia de salud
   mundial se asignan de manera desproporcionada a los hombres; este
   desequilibrio es aun mas notorio en los paises de ingresos bajos y
   medianos. La subrepresentacion de las mujeres en los cargos de
   responsabilidad pone en peligro la equidad entre los hombres y las
   mujeres y tiene ademas repercusiones en los resultados de salud de las
   mujeres en el mundo. En el presente articulo de opinion, se sostiene que
   promover a las mujeres a las funciones directivas relacionadas con la
   salud mundial y facilitar su permanencia en ellas genera una reaccion en
   cadena que puede dar lugar a mejores resultados de salud a escala
   mundial. Se proponen soluciones viables y practicas encaminadas a
   estimular la presencia de las mujeres en los cargos de responsabilidad
   en materia de salud mundial y a respaldar su permanencia en esta
   actividad.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical trials test new ways to prevent, detect, diagnose, or treat diseases. Researchers have found that minority patients are willing to participate in clinical trials, yet these patients have barriers which hinder their access to trials.; METHODS: To explore African American women's participation in breast cancer clinical trials, eight focus groups were conducted with breast cancer patients, family members/care givers, religious leaders, and healthcare providers to gather information on the perspectives and opinions on the topic. The focus group conversations were transcribed, and transcripts were imported into QSR International's NVivo 10 software. The transcripts were organized into folders based on four categories. The content analysis performed was based on recordings and notes.; RESULTS: The following themes were generated as a result of conducting these focus groups and gathering information on the perspectives and opinions about participating in clinical trials, based on the groups who participated: Promoting participation in research; Personal experience with cancer; Support and support services; Awareness, knowledge, and experience with clinical trials; Providers' roles in clinical trials.; CONCLUSION: The data collected in this study present several actionable themes that, if addressed by individual researchers and the medical community at large, could increase participation in clinical trials by African American patients. They also provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing African American patients' decisions around participating in clinical trials.

AB PURPOSE: Genotype-directed therapy is the standard of care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but obtaining tumor tissue for genotyping remains a challenge. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) or cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis may allow for noninvasive evaluation. This prospective trial evaluated CTCs and cfDNA in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib until progression.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients were enrolled in a phase II trial of erlotinib. Blood was collected at baseline, every 2 months on study, and at disease progression. Plasma genotyping was performed by droplet digital PCR for EGFR19del, L858R, and T790M. CTCs were isolated by CellSave, enumerated, and analyzed by immunofluorescence for CD45 and pan-cytokeratin and EGFR and MET FISH were also performed. Rebiopsy was performed at disease progression.; RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled; 44 patients discontinued therapy for disease progression. Rebiopsy occurred in 35 of 44 patients (80%), with paired CTC/cfDNA analysis in 41 of 44 samples at baseline and 36 of 44 samples at progression. T790M was identified in 23 of 35 (66%) tissue biopsies and 9 of 39 (23%) cfDNA samples. CTC analysis at progression identified MET amplification in 3 samples in which tissue analysis could not be performed. cfDNA analysis identified T790M in 2 samples in which rebiopsy was not possible. At diagnosis, high levels of cfDNA but not high levels of CTCs correlated with progression-free survival.; CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA and CTCs are complementary, noninvasive assays for evaluation of acquired resistance to first-line EGFR TKIs and may expand the number of patients in whom actionable genetic information can be obtained at acquired resistance. Serial cfDNA monitoring may offer greater clinical utility than serial monitoring of CTCs. Clin Cancer Res; 22(24); 6010-20. ©2016 AACR. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to identify genomic alterations (GA) in salivary gland adenocarcinomas, not otherwise specified (NOS), salivary duct carcinomas (SDC), carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (ca ex PA), and salivary carcinoma, NOS.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA was extracted from 149 tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on hybridization-captured adaptor ligation-based libraries of 182 or 315 cancer-related genes plus introns from 14 or 28 genes frequently rearranged for cancer and evaluated for all classes of GAs.; RESULTS: A total of 590 GAs were found in 157 unique genes (mean 3.9/tumor). GAs in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were more common in SDC (53.6%) than other histologies (P = 0.019) Cyclin-dependent kinase GAs varied among all histotypes: adenocarcinoma, NOS (34.6%); SDC (12.2%); ca ex PA (16.7%); carcinoma, NOS (31.2%; P = 0.043). RAS GAs were observed: adenocarcinoma, NOS (17.3%); SDC (26.8%); ca ex PA (4.2%); and carcinoma, NOS (9.4%; P = 0.054). ERBB2 GAs, including amplifications and mutations, were common: adenocarcinoma, NOS (13.5%); SDC (26.8%); ca ex PA (29.2%); carcinoma, NOS (18.8; P = 0.249). Other notable GAs include TP53 in >45% of each histotype; NOTCH1: adenocarcinoma, NOS (7.7%), ca ex PA (8.3%), carcinoma, NOS (21.6%); NF1: adenocarcinoma, NOS (9.6%), SDC (17.1%), carcinoma, NOS (18.8%). RET fusions were identified in one adenocarcinoma, NOS (CCDC6-RET) and two SDCs (NCOA4-RET). Clinical responses were observed in patients treated with anti-HER2 and anti-RET-targeted therapies.; CONCLUSIONS: CGP of salivary adenocarcinoma, NOS, SDCs, ca ex PA, and carcinoma, NOS revealed diverse GAs that may lead to novel treatment options.

AB Precision oncology entails making treatment decisions based on a tumor's molecular characteristics. For prostate cancer, identifying clinically relevant molecular subgroups is challenging, as molecular profiling is not routine outside of academic centers. Since histologic variants of other cancers correlates with specific genomic alterations, we sought to determine if ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (dPC) - a rare and aggressive histopathologic variant - was associated with any recurrent actionable mutations. Tumors from 10 consecutive patients with known dPC were sequenced on a targeted next-generation DNA sequencing panel. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years (range, 40-73). Four (40%) patients had metastases upon presentation. Archival tissue from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate tissue samples from nine patients and a biopsy of a metastasis from one patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer were available for analysis. Nine of 10 samples had sufficient material for tumor sequencing. Four (40%) patients' tumors had a mismatch repair (MMR) gene alteration (N = 2, MSH2; N = 1, MSH6; and N = 1, MLH1), of which 3 (75%) had evidence of hypermutation. Sections of the primary carcinomas of three additional patients with known MMR gene alterations/hypermutation were histologically evaluated; two of these tumors had dPC. MMR mutations associated with hypermutation were common in our cohort of dPC patients. Since hypermutation may predict for response to immune checkpoint blockade, the presence of dPC may be a rapid means to enrich populations for further screening. Given our small sample size, these findings require replication.

AB BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a web-based audit and feedback (A&F) intervention with outreach visits to support decision-making by multidisciplinary teams.; METHODS: We performed a multicentre cluster-randomized trial within the field of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in the Netherlands. Our participants were multidisciplinary teams in Dutch CR centres who were enrolled in the study between July 2012 and December 2013 and received the intervention for at least 1year. The intervention included web-based A&F with feedback on clinical performance, facilities for goal setting and action planning, and educational outreach visits. Teams were randomized either to receive feedback that was limited to psychosocial rehabilitation (study group A) or to physical rehabilitation (study group B). The main outcome measure was the difference in performance between study groups in 11 care processes and six patient outcomes, measured at patient level. Secondary outcomes included effects on guideline concordance for the four main CR therapies.; RESULTS: Data from 18 centres (14,847 patients) were analysed, of which 12 centres (9353 patients) were assigned to group A and six (5494 patients) to group B. During the intervention, a total of 233 quality improvement goals was identified by participating teams, of which 49 (21%) were achieved during the study period. Except for a modest improvement in data completeness (4.5% improvement per year; 95% CI 0.65 to 8.36), we found no effect of our intervention on any of our primary or secondary outcome measures.; CONCLUSIONS: Within a multidisciplinary setting, our web-based A&F intervention engaged teams to define local performance improvement goals but failed to support them in actually completing the improvement actions that were needed to achieve those goals. Future research should focus on improving the actionability of feedback on clinical performance and on addressing the socio-technical perspective of the implementation process.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR3251.

AB E-cadherin (CDH1) is a glycoprotein that mediates adhesion between epithelial cells and also suppresses cancer invasion. Mutation or deletion of the CDH1 gene has been reported in 30-60% cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). However, little is known about genomic differences between ILC with and without a CDH1 alteration. Therefore, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 169 ILC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to address this deficiency. Our study shows that CDH1 gene was altered in 59.2% (100/169) of ILC. No significant difference was identified between CDH1-altered and -unaltered ILC cases for any of the examined demographic, clinical or pathologic characteristics, including histologic grade, tumor stage, lymph node metastases, or ER/PR/HER2 states. Seven recurrent mutations (PTEN, MUC16, ERBB2, FAT4, PCDHGA2, HERC1 and FLNC) and four chromosomal changes with recurrent copy number variation (CNV) (11q13, 17q12-21, 8p11 and 8q11) were found in ILC, which correlated with a positive or negative CDH1 alteration status, respectively. The prevalence of the most common breast cancer driver abnormalities including TP53 and PIK3CA mutations and MYC and ERBB2 amplifications showed no difference between the two groups. However, CDH1-altered ILC with an ERBB2 mutation shows a significantly worse prognosis compared to its counterparts without such a mutation. Our study suggests that CDH1-altered ILC patients with ERBB2 mutations may represent an actionable group of patients who could benefit from targeted breast cancer therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal carcinomas are genomically complex cancers that are lethal in the metastatic setting. Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing allow for the simultaneous characterization of multiple oncogenic pathways.; METHODS: We report 3 cases of metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma in patients enrolled in the Personalized Onco-Genomics program at the BC Cancer Agency. Real-time genomic profiling was combined with clinical expertise to diagnose a carcinoma of unknown primary, to explore treatment response to bevacizumab in a colorectal cancer, and to characterize an appendiceal adenocarcinoma.; RESULTS: In the first case, genomic profiling revealed an IDH1 somatic mutation, supporting the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in a malignancy of unknown origin, and further guided therapy by identifying epidermal growth factor receptor amplification. In the second case, a BRAF V600E mutation and wild-type KRAS profile justified the use of targeted therapies to treat a colonic adenocarcinoma. The third case was an appendiceal adenocarcinoma defined by a p53 inactivation; Ras/raf/mek, Akt/mtor, Wnt, and notch pathway activation; and overexpression of ret, erbb2 (her2), erbb3, met, and cell cycle regulators.; SUMMARY: We show that whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing can be achieved within clinically effective timelines, yielding clinically useful and actionable information.

AB Since 2002, there has been a gradual worldwide 1.3% annual decrease in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB). This is an encouraging statistic; however, it will not achieve the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating TB by 2050, and it is being compounded by the persistent global incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) acquired by transmission and by treatment pressure. One key to effectively control tuberculosis and the spread of multiresistant strains is accurate information pertaining to drug resistance and susceptibility. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has the potential to effectively change global health and the management of TB. Industry has focused primarily on using NGS for oncology diagnostics and human genomics, but the area in which NGS can rapidly impact health care is in the area of infectious disease diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries. To date, there has been a failure as a community to capitalize on the potential of NGS, especially at the reference laboratory level where it can provide actionable information pertaining to treatment options for patients. The rapid evolution of knowledge about the genetic foundations of tuberculosis drug resistance makes sequencing a versatile technology platform for providing rapid, accurate, and actionable results for treating this disease. No "plug-and-play" and "end-to-end" NGS solutions exist that provide clinically relevant sequence data from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genome from primary clinical samples (e.g., sputum) in high-burden country reference laboratories, which is where they are most needed. However, such a system-based solution is underdeveloped by Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics (FIND), in collaboration with partners from academia, nongovernmental organizations, and industry. The solution is modular and is designed and developed to perform targeted amplicon sequencing directly from a patient's primary sputum sample. This solution will initially allow reference laboratories to perform reflex NGS that provides a rapid and comprehensive analysis of a patient's M. tuberculosis complex drug resistance profile, thereby facilitating optimization of a patient's treatment, improving treatment outcomes, and reducing the spread of DR-TB. Such a system could also enable countries to implement culture-free drug resistance surveillance programs, which could bypass the need for expensive culture facilities, decrease a country's dependence on external laboratories, and significantly expand the map of global surveillance capabilities. In addition, the introduction of such a system will provide a foundation for NGS to be used for genotypic testing for human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, surveillance of other diseases, in-country capability for outbreak discovery and management, and a host of other diagnostic benefits that are currently limited to high-income countries.

AB OBJECTIVE: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line anti-TB drugs. Here, we designed and produced antibodies based on biomarkers that exist only in MDR-TB.; METHODS: Bacilli were cultured for 4weeks at 37°C, and protein extraction was performed by sequential extraction. Bacterial cells were sonicated, centrifuged at 5000rpm for 45min, and the supernatant was collected and subjected to multiple rounds of treatment to prior to protein isolation. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method, and extracted proteins (50mug) from each strain (drug-sensitive- and MDR-TB isolates) were visualized on polyacrylamide gels (5-15%) with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Three extracts were mixed and dialyzed against 0.1M ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0), followed by mass spectrometry. Specific polyclonal antibodies against purified MDR-TB proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and prepared in rabbits using three booster injections. The ELIZA test was performed for evaluation the antibody production. The antibody was treated with normal oral flora to remove any non specificity and cross reactivity. Analyses of different protein patterns (drug-sensitive- and MDR-TB) were performed by western blot.; RESULTS: Our revealed that the MDR-TB strains contained specific antigens, and that the protein profiles of drug-sensitive TB strains differed from those of the MDR-TB isolates. Five bands from the MDR-TB fractions were detected as diagnostic antigens and were not observed in drug-sensitive-TB fractions. Western blot results showed that the MDR-TB antigenic fractions showed immunogenic bands at 50.0kDa and 70.0kDa, with the five antigenic MDR-TB-specific bands were identified as Rv3248c, Rv0350, Rv0440, Rv0475, and Rv3588c.; CONCLUSION: Western blot data revealed dynamic properties of antibody responses that led to actionable findings for further research. Moreover, specific anti-mycobacterial antibodies, such as MDR-TB antibodies, can be essential tools in the identification of species-restricted antigens, such as drug-resistant TB antigens. The MDR-TB antibodies described here might promote identification of mycobacterial antigens during the course of infection, which could be helpful for the development of newer TB-vaccine candidates or therapeutic agents for improved TB treatment or diagnosis.

AB Neuroblastoma is characterized by a relative paucity of recurrent somatic mutations at diagnosis. However, recent studies have shown that the mutational burden increases at relapse, likely as a result of clonal evolution of mutation-carrying cells during primary treatment. To inform the development of personalized therapies, we sought to further define the frequency of potentially actionable mutations in neuroblastoma, both at diagnosis and after chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective study to determine mutation frequency, the only inclusion criterion being availability of cancer gene panel sequencing data from Foundation Medicine. We analyzed 151 neuroblastoma tumor samples: 44 obtained at diagnosis, 42 at second look surgery or biopsy for stable disease after chemotherapy, and 59 at relapse (6 were obtained at unknown time points). Nine patients had multiple tumor biopsies. ALK was the most commonly mutated gene in this cohort, and we observed a higher frequency of suspected oncogenic ALK mutations in relapsed disease than at diagnosis. Patients with relapsed disease had, on average, a greater number of mutations reported to be recurrent in cancer, and a greater number of mutations in genes that are potentially targetable with available therapeutics. We also observed an enrichment of reported recurrent RAS/MAPK pathway mutations in tumors obtained after chemotherapy. Our data support recent evidence suggesting that neuroblastomas undergo substantial mutational evolution during therapy, and that relapsed disease is more likely to be driven by a targetable oncogenic pathway, highlighting that it is critical to base treatment decisions on the molecular profile of the tumor at the time of treatment. However, it will be necessary to conduct prospective clinical trials that match sequencing results to targeted therapeutic intervention to determine if cancer genomic profiling improves patient outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Major advances have been achieved in the characterization of early breast cancer (eBC) genomic profiles. Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is associated with poor outcomes, yet limited information is available on the genomic profile of this disease. This study aims to decipher mutational profiles of mBC using next-generation sequencing.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 216 tumor-blood pairs from mBC patients who underwent a biopsy in the context of the SAFIR01, SAFIR02, SHIVA, or Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment Optimization (MOSCATO) prospective trials. Mutational profiles from 772 primary breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as a reference for comparing primary and mBC mutational profiles. Twelve genes (TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, ESR1, MAP3K1, CDH1, AKT1, MAP2K4, RB1, PTEN, CBFB, and CDKN2A) were identified as significantly mutated in mBC (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1). Eight genes (ESR1, FSIP2, FRAS1, OSBPL3, EDC4, PALB2, IGFN1, and AGRN) were more frequently mutated in mBC as compared to eBC (FDR < 0.01). ESR1 was identified both as a driver and as a metastatic gene (n = 22, odds ratio = 29, 95% CI [9-155], p = 1.2e-12) and also presented with focal amplification (n = 9) for a total of 31 mBCs with either ESR1 mutation or amplification, including 27 hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2 negative (HER2-) mBCs (19%). HR+/HER2- mBC presented a high prevalence of mutations on genes located on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (TSC1 and TSC2) as compared to HR+/HER2- eBC (respectively 6% and 0.7%, p = 0.0004). Other actionable genes were more frequently mutated in HR+ mBC, including ERBB4 (n = 8), NOTCH3 (n = 7), and ALK (n = 7). Analysis of mutational signatures revealed a significant increase in APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in HR+/HER2- metastatic tumors as compared to primary TCGA samples (p < 2e-16). The main limitations of this study include the absence of bone metastases and the size of the cohort, which might not have allowed the identification of rare mutations and their effect on survival.; CONCLUSIONS: This work reports the results of the analysis of the first large-scale study on mutation profiles of mBC. This study revealed genomic alterations and mutational signatures involved in the resistance to therapies, including actionable mutations.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study illustrates a systematic methodology to embed medical costs into the exact flow of clinical events associated with chronic care delivery. We summarized and visualized the results using clinical and cost data, with the goal of empowering patients and care providers with actionable information as they navigate through a multitude of clinical events and medical expenses.; STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the electronic health records (EHRs) and medication cost data of 288 patients from 2009 to 2011, whose initial diagnoses included chronic kidney disease stage 3, hypertension, and diabetes.; METHODS: We developed chronological pathways of care and costs for each patient from EHR and medication cost data. Using a data-driven method called clinical pathway (CP) learning, which leverages statistical machine-learning algorithms, we categorized patients into clinically similar subgroups based on progressing clinical complexity and associated care needs. The CP-based subgroups were compared against cost-based subgroups stratified by quartiles of total medication costs, and visualized via pathways that are color-coded by costs.; RESULTS: Our methods identified 3 CP-based, and 4 cost-based, patient subgroups. Two sets of subgroups from each approach indicated some clinical similarity in terms of average statistics, such as number of diagnoses and medication needs. However, the CP-based subgroups displayed significant variation in costs; conversely, large differences in clinical needs were observed among cost-based subgroups.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CPs extracted from EHRs can be enhanced with appropriate cost information to potentially provide detailed visibility into the variability and inconsistencies in current best practices for chronic care delivery.

AB Eighty-six percent of those engaged in HIV medical care in Massachusetts achieved viral suppression, making Massachusetts's long-term goal of eliminating new infections of HIV a real possibility. In order to achieve this goal, Massachusetts is working to engage all individuals living with HIV/AIDS in HIV medical care, keep them retained in care, and render their viral load non-detectable. Currently, in Massachusetts, the data elements necessary to monitor the HIV care continuum are documented in siloed health information systems that do not communicate with each other. Massachusetts has engaged in a pilot project to enhance their health information technology (IT) capacity to monitor the HIV care continuum and identify gaps in care. Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network (MAVEN) will be enhanced to perform as a consolidated electronic system to document and triage clinic-, laboratory-, and patient-level surveillance, field epidemiology and HIV care continuum data. The consolidation will enhance identification of patients infected with HIV and provide timely, actionable data for engagement and retention in HIV medical care.

AB CONTEXT: - In the burgeoning era of molecular genomics, immunoperoxidase (IPOX) testing grows increasingly relevant as an efficient and effective molecular screening tool. Patients with lung carcinoma may especially benefit from the use of IPOX because most lung carcinomas are inoperable at diagnosis and only diagnosed by small tissue biopsy or fine-needle sampling. When such small specimens are at times inadequate for molecular testing, positive IPOX results still provide actionable information.; OBJECTIVE: - To describe the benefits and pitfalls of IPOX in the detection of biomarkers in lung carcinoma cytology specimens and small biopsies by summarizing the currently available commercial antibodies, preanalytic variables, and analytic considerations.; DATA SOURCES: - PubMed.; CONCLUSIONS: - Commercial antibodies exist for IPOX detection of aberrant protein expression due to EGFR L858R mutation, EGFR E746_A750 deletion, ALK rearrangement, ROS1 rearrangement, and BRAF V600E mutation, as well as PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Automated IPOX protocols for ALK and PD-L1 detection were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration as companion diagnostics for targeted therapies, but consistent interpretive criteria remain to be elucidated, and such protocols do not yet exist for other biomarkers. The inclusion of cytology specimens in clinical trials would expand patients' access to testing and treatment, yet there is a scarcity of clinical trial data regarding the application of IPOX to cytology, which can be attributed to trial designers' lack of familiarity with the advantages and limitations of cytology. The content of this review may be used to inform clinical trial design and advance IPOX validation studies.

AB The incidence of pancreatic cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer death in United States, is increasing worldwide. Even though the cure rate has doubled in 40 years, it is abysmally poor at 6-7%. As surgical resection remains the only curative treatment and less than 20% of the newly diagnosed cancers are resectable, the major burden of disease management lies in early diagnosis, good prognostication, and proper neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy. With advancing technologies and their ease of availability, researchers have better tools to understand pancreatic cancer. In the post-genetic era, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, metabolomic, and more have brought us to a multi-omics era. These newer avenues bring promises of better screening modalities, less invasive diagnostics and monitoring, subtyping of pancreatic cancer, and fine tuning the treatment modalities not only to the right stage of tumor but also to the right tumor biology. As the multitudes of technologies are generating extensive amounts of incongruous data, they are giving clinicians a lot of non-actionable information. In this paper, we wish to encompass the newer technologies, sub-classifications, and future treatment modalities in personalized care of patients with pancreatic cancer. Copyright A© 2016.

AB PURPOSE: The expanding number of targeted therapeutics for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) necessitates real-time tumor genotyping, yet tissue biopsies are difficult to perform serially and often yield inadequate DNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS). We evaluated the feasibility of using cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS as a complement or alternative to tissue NGS.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 112 plasma samples obtained from a consecutive study of 102 prospectively enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC were subjected to ultra-deep sequencing of up to 70 genes and matched with tissue samples, when possible.; RESULTS: We detected 275 alterations in 45 genes, and at least one alteration in the ctDNA for 86 of 102 patients (84%), with EGFR variants being most common. ctDNA NGS detected 50 driver and 12 resistance mutations, and mutations in 22 additional genes for which experimental therapies, including clinical trials, are available. Although ctDNA NGS was completed for 102 consecutive patients, tissue sequencing was only successful for 50 patients (49%). Actionable EGFR mutations were detected in 24 tissue and 19 ctDNA samples, yielding concordance of 79%, with a shorter time interval between tissue and blood collection associated with increased concordance (P = 0.038). ctDNA sequencing identified eight patients harboring a resistance mutation who developed progressive disease while on targeted therapy, and for whom tissue sequencing was not possible.; CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutically targetable driver and resistance mutations can be detected by ctDNA NGS, even when tissue is unavailable, thus allowing more accurate diagnosis, improved patient management, and serial sampling to monitor disease progression and clonal evolution.

AB PURPOSE: At present, a one-size-fits-all approach is typically used for cancer therapy in patients. This is mainly because there is no current imaging-based clinical standard for the early assessment and monitoring of cancer treatment response. Here, the authors have developed, for the first time, a complete computer-aided-prognosis (CAP) system based on multiparametric quantitative ultrasound (QUS) spectroscopy methods in association with texture descriptors and advanced machine learning techniques. This system was used to noninvasively categorize and predict cell death levels in fibrosarcoma mouse tumors treated using ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles as novel endothelial-cell radiosensitizers.; METHODS: Sarcoma xenograft tumor-bearing mice were treated using ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles, alone or in combination with x-ray radiation therapy, as a new antivascular treatment. Therapy effects were assessed at 2-3, 24, and 72 h after treatment using a high-frequency ultrasound. Two-dimensional spectral parametric maps were generated using the power spectra of the raw radiofrequency echo signal. Subsequently, the distances between "pretreatment" and "post-treatment" scans were computed as an indication of treatment efficacy, using a kernel-based metric on textural features extracted from 2D parametric maps. A supervised learning paradigm was used to either categorize cell death levels as low, medium, or high using a classifier, or to "continuously" predict the levels of cell death using a regressor.; RESULTS: The developed CAP system performed at a high level for the classification of cell death levels. The area under curve of the receiver operating characteristic was 0.87 for the classification of cell death levels to both low/medium and medium/high levels. Moreover, the prediction of cell death levels using the proposed CAP system achieved a good correlation (r = 0.68, p < 0.001) with histological cell death levels as the ground truth. A statistical test of significance between individual treatment groups with the corresponding control group demonstrated that the predicted levels indicated the same significant changes in cell death as those indicated by the ground-truth levels.; CONCLUSIONS: The technology developed in this study addresses a gap in the current standard of care by introducing a quality control step that generates potentially actionable metrics needed to enhance treatment decision-making. The study establishes a noninvasive framework for quantifying levels of cancer treatment response developed preclinically in tumors using QUS imaging in conjunction with machine learning techniques. The framework can potentially facilitate the detection of refractory responses in patients to a certain cancer treatment early on in the course of therapy to enable switching to more efficacious treatments.

AB Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of aggressive lymphoma in the Western world and remains a clinical challenge. Two types of DLBCL are distinguishable, namely a germinal center B-cell-like phenotype (GCB) and an activated B-cell-like phenotype (ABC). Particularly ABC-DLBCL is difficult to treat, as this subentity typically displays resistance against frontline chemo-immune therapy. Through the availability of novel experimental technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and cutting-edge mouse models, we recently caught an unprecedentedly detailed glimpse at the genomic and biological features of ABC-DLBCL. Currently, a picture is emerging which suggests that ABC-DLBCL critically depends on sustained activity of the NFkappaB pathway, which, among others, is achieved through numerous distinct genetic aberrations, including CD79A/B-, CARD11-, and MYD88 mutations. Further genomic aberrations include amplifications of BCL2 and inactivating mutations in PRMD1. These molecular insights have spurred the development of novel autochthonous mouse models that faithfully mimic the biology and genetics of human ABC-DLBCL and could serve as preclinical platforms in future experiments. Furthermore, our genomic understanding of the disease now enables us to develop and validate novel targeted therapeutic intervention strategies that aim at decapitating non-physiological NFkappaB activity and repressing anti-apoptotic BCL2 signaling. In this review, we highlight these recent developments and make suggestions for further tool development and the design and stratification of future clinical trials. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB Over the past decade, emerging technologies have provided new insights into the genomic landscape of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). In addition to the commonly recognized genetic drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4), new genes and pathways have been implicated. However, these efforts have not identified any new high-frequency actionable mutations, limiting the success of mutation-targeted therapy in PDA.

AB Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. The risk of stroke can be significantly decreased by oral anticoagulation (OAC). Our objective was to characterize the filling of OAC prescriptions for patients with actionable AF (new or existing AF with an indication for OAC but not prescribed) and determine the prevalence and predictors of guideline-appropriate therapy at 30days. This is a multi-hospital, retrospective cohort study of patients who visited the Emergency Department (ED) and had a discharge diagnosis of AF. Patient records were examined to identify demographics, risk factors, and prescription data. Predictors of filling a prescription at 30days were analyzed. 788 patients with AF were reviewed. 257 patients had actionable AF. Forty one percent (104) had newly diagnosed AF. The mean CHADS2 score was 2±1. At 30days after discharge, 25.7% of patients filled a prescription for OAC therapy. Large numbers of patients attending the ED have actionable AF, but rates of guideline-directed OAC at thirty days are low. Only a prescription written by the ED physician (OR 9.89) and documentation of stroke risk stratification in the patients' chart (OR 4.09) were associated with the primary outcome.

AB The productivity of cell culture-derived vaccines grown in anchorage-dependent animal cells is limited by bioreactor surface area. One way to increase the available surface area is by growing cells as monolayers on small spheres called microcarriers, which are approximately 100-250mum in diameter. In order for microcarrier-based cell culture to be a success, it is important to understand the kinetics of cell growth on the microcarriers. Micro-flow imaging (MFI) is a simple and powerful technique that captures images and analyzes samples as they are drawn through a precision flow cell. In addition to providing size distribution and defect frequency data to compare microcarrier lots, MFI was used to generate hundreds of images to determine cell coverage and confluency on microcarriers. Same-day manual classification of these images provided upstream cell culture teams with actionable data that informed in-process decision making (e.g. time of infection). Additionally, an automated cell coverage algorithm was developed to increase the speed and throughput of the analyses.

AB PURPOSE: New teacher evaluation systems have expanded the role of principals as instructional leaders, but little is known about principals' ability to promote teacher development through the evaluation process. We conducted a case study of principals' perspectives on evaluation and their experiences implementing observation and feedback cycles to better understand whether principals feel as though they are able to promote teacher development as evaluators.; RESEARCH METHODS: We conducted interviews with a stratified random sample of 24 principals in an urban district that recently implemented major reforms to its teacher evaluation system. We analyzed these interviews by drafting thematic summaries, coding interview transcripts, creating data-analytic matrices, and writing analytic memos.; FINDINGS: We found that the evaluation reforms provided a common framework and language that helped facilitate principals' feedback conversations with teachers. However, we also found that tasking principals with primary responsibility for conducting evaluations resulted in a variety of unintended consequences which undercut the quality of evaluation feedback they provided. We analyze five broad solutions to these challenges: strategically targeting evaluations, reducing operational responsibilities, providing principal training, hiring instructional coaches, and developing peer evaluation systems.; IMPLICATIONS: The quality of feedback teachers receive through the evaluation process depends critically on the time and training evaluators have to provide individualized and actionable feedback. Districts that task principals with primary responsibility for conducting observation and feedback cycles must attend to the many implementation challenges associated with this approach in order for next-generation evaluation systems to successfully promote teacher development.

AB Lymphocyte subpopulations producing cytokines and exerting regulatory functions represent key immune elements. Given their reciprocal interdependency lymphocyte subpopulations are usually assayed as diagnostic panels, rather than single biomarkers for specialist clinical use. This retrospective analysis on lymphocyte subpopulations, analyzed over the last few years in an outpatient laboratory in Northeast Italy, contributes to the establishment of reference values for several regulatory lymphocytes currently lacking such reference ranges for the general population. Mean values and ranges in a sample of Caucasian patients (mean age 42±8,5 years), were provided for Th1, Th2, Th17, Th-reg, Tc-reg, Tc-CD57+ and B1 lymphocytes. The results are consistent with what is found in literature for the single subtypes and are: Th1 157.8±60.3/l (7.3%±2.9); Th2 118.2±52.2/l (5.4%±2.5); Th17 221.6±90.2/l (10.5%±4.4); Th-reg 15.1±10.2/l (0.7%±0.4); Tc-reg 5.8±4.7/l (0.3%±0.2); Tc-CD57+ 103.7±114.1/l (4.6%±4.7); B1 33.7±22.8/l (1.5%±0.9); (Values are mean±SD). The results show that despite their variability, mean values are rather consistent in all age or sex groups and can be used as laboratory internal reference for this regulatory panel. Adding regulatory cells to lymphocyte subpopulations panels allows a more complete view of the state of the subject's immune network balance, thus improving the personalization and the "actionability" of diagnostic data in a systems medicine perspective.

AB Importance: The molecular landscape underpinning response to the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is undefined. Consequently, there is an urgent need for practical biomarkers to guide therapy selection and elucidate resistance. Although tissue biopsies are impractical to perform routinely in the majority of patients with mCRPC, the analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has recently emerged as a minimally invasive method to explore tumor characteristics.; Objective: To reveal genomic characteristics from cfDNA associated with clinical outcomes during enzalutamide treatment.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Plasma samples were obtained from August 4, 2013, to July 31, 2015, at a single academic institution (British Columbia Cancer Agency) from 65 patients with mCRPC. We collected temporal plasma samples (at baseline, 12 weeks, end of treatment) for circulating cfDNA and performed array comparative genomic hybridization copy number profiling and deep AR gene sequencing. Samples collected at end of treatment were also subjected to targeted sequencing of 19 prostate cancer-associated genes.; Exposure: Enzalutamide, 160 mg, daily orally.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Prostate-specific antigen response rate (decline ≥50% from baseline confirmed ≥3 weeks later). Radiographic (as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 Criteria) and/or clinical progression (defined as worsening disease-related symptoms necessitating a change in anticancer therapy and/or deterioration in Eastern Cooperative Group performance status ≥2 levels).; Results: The 65 patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 74 (68-79) years. Prostate-specific antigen response rate to enzalutamide treatment was 38% (25 of 65), while median clinical/radiographic progression-free survival was 3.5 (95% CI, 2.1-5.0) months. Cell-free DNA was isolated from 122 of 125 plasma samples, and targeted sequencing was successful in 119 of 122. AR mutations and/or copy number alterations were robustly detected in 48% (31 of 65) and 60% (18 of 30) of baseline and progression samples, respectively. Detection of AR amplification, heavily mutated AR (≥2 mutations), and RB1 loss were associated with worse progression-free survival, with hazard ratios of 2.92 (95% CI, 1.59-5.37), 3.94 (95% CI, 1.46-10.64), and 4.46 (95% CI, 2.28-8.74), respectively. AR mutations exhibited clonal selection during treatment, including an increase in glucocorticoid-sensitive AR L702H and promiscuous AR T878A in patients with prior abiraterone treatment. At the time of progression, cfDNA sequencing revealed mutations or copy number changes in all patients tested, including clinically actionable alterations in DNA damage repair genes and PI3K pathway genes, and a high frequency (4 of 14) of activating CTNNB1 mutations.; Conclusions and Relevance: Clinically informative genomic profiling of cfDNA was feasible in nearly all patients with mCRPC and can provide important insights into enzalutamide response and resistance.

AB BACKGROUND: One of the common problems faced by patients in any government hospital is the fact that they do not get the results of the laboratory investigation ordered on them at the proper time. While the issues of quality control in laboratory have been adequately addressed by most of the hospital laboratories, the practice of issuing results to the patient in most hospitals is manual and this adds the element of human errors involved in retrieval and issue of the results to them. Hence an attempt was made to send the laboratory results as short message service (SMS) to the patients.; METHODS: The project was started for haematology and biochemistry reports as they comprised most of the bulk of investigation ordered on patients. In-house modules were developed using MS Access for the data-entry of the haematology and biochemistry results. The results were then mapped to the patients' name and telephone. Services of an SMS gateway firm were used to then send the results to the patient in the form of SMS.; RESULTS: On an average 150 haematology and 250 biochemistry results are being sent daily to different patients. The cost of sending one SMS is approximately Rs. 0.10. This has resulted in a significant improvement of clientele satisfaction.; CONCLUSION: Sending laboratory reports as SMS to patients is an easy, efficient and economical way to reach out to the clientele and improve their satisfaction. The method can easily be duplicated in other hospitals also.

AB BACKGROUND: RET rearrangements are found in 1-2% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Cabozantinib is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RET that produced a 10% overall response in unselected patients with lung cancers. To assess the activity of cabozantinib in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers, we did a prospective phase 2 trial in this molecular subgroup.; METHODS: We enrolled patients in this open-label, Simon two-stage, single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA if they met the following criteria: metastatic or unresectable lung cancer harbouring a RET rearrangement, Karnofsky performance status higher than 70, and measurable disease. Patients were given 60 mg of cabozantinib orally per day. The primary objective was to determine the overall response (Response Criteria Evaluation in Solid Tumors version 1.1) in assessable patients; those who received at least one dose of cabozantinib, and had been given CT imaging at baseline and at least one protocol-specified follow-up timepoint. We did safety analyses in the modified intention-to-treat population who received at least one dose of cabozantinib. The accrual of patients with RET-rearranged lung cancer to this protocol has been completed but the trial is still ongoing because several patients remain on active treatment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01639508.; FINDINGS: Between July 13, 2012, and April 30, 2016, 26 patients with RET-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas were enrolled and given cabozantinib; 25 patients were assessable for a response. KIF5B-RET was the predominant fusion type identified in 16 (62%) patients. The study met its primary endpoint, with confirmed partial responses seen in seven of 25 response-assessable patients (overall response 28%, 95% CI 12-49). Of the 26 patients given cabozantinib, the most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were lipase elevation in four (15%) patients, increased alanine aminotransferase in two (8%) patients, increased aspartate aminotransferase in two (8%) patients, decreased platelet count in two (8%) patients, and hypophosphataemia in two (8%) patients. No drug-related deaths were recorded but 16 (62%) patients died during the course of follow-up. 19 (73%) patients required dose reductions due to drug-related adverse events.; INTERPRETATION: The reported activity of cabozantinib in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers defines RET rearrangements as actionable drivers in patients with lung cancers. An improved understanding of tumour biology and novel therapeutic approaches will be needed to improve outcomes with RET-directed targeted treatment.; FUNDING: Exelixis, National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA008748.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: The increased number of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in developed countries is of great clinical relevance and involves a large burden of the healthcare system. The management of these patients is focused on relieving symptoms and improving clinical outcomes. Therefore the ideal test would provide the correct diagnosis and actionable information. To this aim, several non-invasive functional imaging modalities are usually used as gatekeeper to invasive coronary angiography (ICA), but their diagnostic yield remains low with limited accuracy when compared to obstructive CAD at the time of ICA or invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). Invasive FFR is considered the gold standard for the evaluation of functionally relevant CAD. Therefore, an urgent need for non-invasive techniques that evaluate both the functional and morphological severity of CAD is growing. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a unique non-invasive technique providing coronary artery anatomic imaging. More recently, the evaluation of FFR with CCTA (FFRCT) has demonstrated high diagnostic performance compared to invasive FFR. Additionally, stress myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) represents a novel tool for the diagnosis of ischemia with high diagnostic accuracy. Compared to nuclear imaging and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, both FFRCT and stress-CTP, allow us to integrate the anatomical evaluation of coronary arteries with the functional relevance of coronary artery lesions having the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic paradigm of suspected CAD. FFRCT and stress-CTP could be assimilated in diagnostic pathways of patients with stable CAD and will likely result in a decrease of invasive diagnostic procedures and costs. The current review evaluates the technical aspects and clinical experience of FFRCT and stress-CTP in the evaluation of functionally relevant CAD discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

AB PURPOSE: Mutations in PALB2 have been associated with a predisposition to breast and pancreatic cancers. This study aims to characterize a novel PALB2 exon 13 duplication in a hereditary breast and ovarian cancer family.; METHODS: The PALB2 exon 13 duplication in this family was evaluated using Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) and confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The duplication breakpoints were determined by long-range PCR and DNA sequencing. The effects of this mutation on mRNA splicing were characterized using RT-PCR, cloning, and DNA sequencing.; RESULTS: The 5' and 3' breakpoints were mapped to intron 12 and downstream of 3'UTR. The tandem duplication is mediated by Alu elements in these regions. This duplication disrupts normal mRNA splicing and presumably leads to a frameshift and premature protein truncation. This duplication segregates with ovarian and breast cancer in multiple members in this family.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PALB2 exon 13 duplication is a pathogenic variant. The presence of the PALB2 duplication in the proband affected with high-grade serous ovarian cancer suggests that PALB2 might be associated with a predisposition to ovarian cancer.

AB Parents' preferences for unsolicited findings (UFs) from diagnostic whole-exome sequencing (WES) for their children remain largely unexplored. Our aim was to gain insight into parental considerations favoring acceptance/decline of UFs pertaining to their child. We conducted 20 qualitative, semistructured interviews with parents (n=34) of children with a developmental delay, aged <1 to 17 years, after consenting to WES, but before feedback of results. Key findings from our study were that all parents favored acceptance of UFs for medically actionable conditions in childhood, but that preferences and considerations diverged for UFs with no medical actionability, or only in adulthood, and regarding carrier-status. Sometimes non-medical utility considerations (considerations of usefulness of knowing UFs, not rooted in (preventive) medical treatment or controls) were given in favor of disclosure of UFs. Sometimes the child's future autonomy formed a reason to withhold UFs at present, despite an unfavorable prognosis concerning the child's cognitive capabilities. Some parents only preferred receiving UFs if these findings were directly related to their reasons for seeking a diagnosis. These findings are essential for developing morally responsible policy and for counseling. Further research should focus on whether considerations of non-medical utility alone can justify disclosure of UFs and whether reasons for seeking a diagnosis place further constraints on what UFs may be returned/withheld. How parents can be aided in contemplating different scenarios regarding their child's future development also deserves further inquiry.

AB BACKGROUND: Routine feasibility and clinical impact of genomics-based tumor profiling in advanced breast cancer (aBC) remains to be determined. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate whether precision medicine could be prospectively implemented for aBC patients in a single center and to examine whether patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) could be obtained in this population.; RESULTS: Thirty-four aBC patients were included. Actionable targets were found in 28 patients (82%). A targeted therapy could be proposed to 22 patients (64%), either through a clinical trial (n=15) and/or using already registered drugs (n=21). Ten patients (29%) eventually received targeted treatment, 2 of them deriving clinical benefit. Of 22 patients subjected to mouse implantation, 10 had successful xenografting (45%), mostly in triple-negative aBC.; METHODS: aBC patients accessible to tumor biopsy were prospectively enrolled at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes in the BC-BIO study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01521676). Genomic profiling was established by whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 365 candidate cancer genes. For a subset of patients, a sample of fresh tumor was orthotopically implanted in humanized cleared fat pads of NSG mice for establishing PDX.; CONCLUSIONS: Precision medicine can be implemented in a single center in the context of clinical practice and may allow genomic-driven treatment in approximately 30% of aBC patients. PDX may be obtained in a significant fraction of cases.

AB Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is required for mitochondrial function, but its role in cancer is controversial. Here we show that transgenic mice expressing the mitochondrial chaperone TNFR-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) in the prostate develop epithelial hyperplasia and cellular atypia. When examined on a Pten+/- background, a common alteration in human prostate cancer, TRAP1 transgenic mice showed accelerated incidence of invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma, characterized by increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, in situ Conversely, homozygous deletion of TRAP1 delays prostatic tumorigenesis in Pten+/- mice without affecting hyperplasia or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Global profiling of Pten+/--TRAP1 transgenic mice by RNA sequencing and reverse phase protein array reveals modulation of oncogenic networks of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility, and DNA damage. Mechanistically, reconstitution of Pten+/- prostatic epithelial cells with TRAP1 increases cell proliferation, reduces apoptosis, and promotes cell invasion without changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Therefore, TRAP1 is a driver of prostate cancer in vivo and an "actionable" therapeutic target. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) are computer programs that provide doctors with person-specific, actionable recommendations, or management options that are intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times to enhance health care. CDSSs might be integrated with patient electronic health records (EHRs) and evidence-based knowledge.; METHODS/DESIGN: The Computerized DEcision Support in ONCOlogy (ONCO-CODES) trial is a pragmatic, parallel group, randomized controlled study with 1:1 allocation ratio. The trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness on clinical practice and quality of care of a multi-specialty collection of patient-specific reminders generated by a CDSS in the IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Curadei Tumori (IRST) hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention can increase clinician adherence to guidelines and, eventually, improve the quality of care offered to cancer patients. The primary outcome is the rate at which the issues reported by the reminders are resolved, aggregating specialty and primary care reminders. We will include all the patients admitted to hospital services. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle.; DISCUSSION: The results of our study will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of CDSSs in cancer hospitals, thereby informing healthcare policy about the potential role of CDSS use. Furthermore, the study will inform whether CDSS may facilitate the integration of primary care in cancer settings, known to be usually limited. The increasing use of and familiarity with advanced technology among new generations of physicians may support integrated approaches to be tested in pragmatic studies determining the optimal interface between primary and oncology care.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02645357.

AB BACKGROUND: Identifying the clinical impact of recurrent mutations can help define their role in cancer. Here, we identify frequent hotspot mutations in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and associate them with clinical outcomes.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hotspot mutation testing was conducted in 500 MBC patients using an 11 gene (N = 126) and/or 46 or 50 gene (N = 391) panel. Patients were stratified by hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status. Clinical outcomes were retrospectively collected.; RESULTS: Hotspot mutations were most frequently detected in TP53 (30%), PIK3CA (27%) and AKT1 (4%). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients had the highest incidence of TP53 (58%) and the lowest incidence of PIK3CA (9%) mutations. TP53 mutation was associated with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) (median 22 vs 42months; P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) from diagnosis of distant metastatic disease (median 26 vs 51months; P < 0.001). Conversely, PIK3CA mutation was associated with a trend towards better clinical outcomes including RFS (median 41 vs 30months; P = 0.074) and OS (52 vs 40months; P = 0.066). In HR-positive patients, TP53 mutation was again associated with shorter RFS (median 30 vs 46months; P = 0.017) and OS (median 30 vs 55months; P = 0.001). When multivariable analysis was performed for RFS and OS, TP53 but not PIK3CA mutation remained a significant predictor of outcomes in the overall cohort and in HR-positive patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinical hotspot sequencing identifies potentially actionable mutations. In this cohort, TP53 mutation was associated with worse clinical outcomes, while PIK3CA mutation did not remain a significant predictor of outcomes after multivariable analysis.

AB It is still controversial whether comprehensive genome screening of target molecules by next generation sequencing (NGS) is needed to increase clinical efficacy of investigational drugs or accelerate drug development, although several studies are being carried out. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to evaluate the feasibility of comprehensive gene screening in this setting. Our findings indicate that actionable alterations were identified in 45% of the analyzed patients, most frequently in those with breast cancer. Common actionable alterations were found in PIK3CA mutation, BRCA2 mutation, ERBB2 amplification, and CCND1 amplification. In total, 22% of the analyzed patients could be entered into phase I clinical trials, and 8% of them were treated with "matched" drugs. Among patients who received matched therapies, response and disease control rates were 33 and 78%, respectively. On the other hand, in the patients who received "non-matched" therapy, the objective response rate was 6%. We believe this data indicates that NGS-based molecular pre-screening is a potent platform for use before patient entry into phase I trials.

AB PURPOSE: There is a growing interest in using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing in patients with cancer.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 168 patients with diverse cancers were analyzed. Patients had digital next-generation sequencing (54 cancer-related gene panel including amplifications in ERBB2, EGFR, and MET) performed on their plasma. Type of genomic alterations, potential actionability, concordance with tissue testing, and patient outcome were examined.; RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of patients (98/168) had ≥1 ctDNA alteration(s). Of the 98 patients with alterations, 71.4% had ≥ 1 alteration potentially actionable by an FDA-approved drug. The median time interval between the tissue biopsy and the blood draw was 2.7 months for patients with ≥ 1 alteration in common compared with 14.4 months (P = 0.006) for the patients in whom no common alterations were identified in the tissue and plasma. Overall concordance rates for tissue and ctDNA were 70.3% for TP53 and EGFR, 88.1% for PIK3CA, and 93.1% for ERBB2 alterations. There was a significant correlation between the cases with ≥ 1 alteration with ctDNA ≥ 5% and shorter survival (median = 4.03 months vs. not reached at median follow-up of 6.1 months; P < 0.001). Finally, 5 of the 12 evaluable patients (42%) matched to a treatment targeting an alteration(s) detected in their ctDNA test achieved stable disease ≥ 6 months/partial remission compared with 2 of 28 patients (7.1%) for the unmatched patients, P = 0.02.; CONCLUSIONS: Our initial study demonstrates that ctDNA tests provide information complementary to that in tissue biopsies and may be useful in determining prognosis and treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in many regions. Unfortunately in some areas, malaria has persisted despite the scale up of ITNs. Recent reports indicate that human behaviour and mosquito behaviour are potential threats to the efficacy of ITNs. However, these concerns are likely highly heterogeneous even at very small scales. This study aimed at developing, testing and validating a rapid assessment tool to collect actionable information at local levels for a quick evaluation of potential barriers to malaria prevention.; METHODS: The study was conducted at the Webuye Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Bungoma East Sub-County, Kenya. Based on the findings from the case-control study, 12 primary surveillance components that encompass the major impediments to successful prevention were identified and used to develop a rapid assessment tool. Twenty community health volunteers were trained to identify patients with laboratory-confirmed malaria in six peripheral health facilities located within six sub locations and subsequently followed them up to their homes to conduct a rapid assessment. Sampling and analysis of the results of the survey are based on Lot Quality Assurance.; RESULTS: The tool was able to detect local heterogeneity in bed net coverage, bed net use and larval site abundance in the six health facility catchment areas. Nearly all the catchment areas met the action threshold for incomplete household coverage (i.e. not all household members not using a net the previous night) except the peri-urban area. Although the threshold for nets not in good condition was set very high (≥50%), only two catchment areas failed to meet the action threshold. On the indicator for "Net not used every day last week", half of the areas failed, while for net ownership, only two areas met the action threshold.; CONCLUSION: The rapid assessment tool was able to detect marked heterogeneity in key indicators for malaria prevention between patients attending health facilities, and can distinguish between priority areas for intervention. There is need to validate it for use in other contexts.

AB In this exciting era of "next-gen cytogenetics," integrating genomic sequencing into the prenatal diagnostic setting is possible within an actionable time frame and can provide precise delineation of balanced chromosomal rearrangements at the nucleotide level. Given the increased risk of congenital abnormalities in newborns with de novo balanced chromosomal rearrangements, comprehensive interpretation of breakpoints could substantially improve prediction of phenotypic outcomes and support perinatal medical care. Herein, we present and evaluate sequencing results of balanced chromosomal rearrangements in ten prenatal subjects with respect to the location of regulatory chromatin domains (topologically associated domains [TADs]). The genomic material from all subjects was interpreted to be "normal" by microarray analyses, and their rearrangements would not have been detected by cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening. The findings of our systematic approach correlate with phenotypes of both pregnancies with untoward outcomes (5/10) and with healthy newborns (3/10). Two pregnancies, one with a chromosomal aberration predicted to be of unknown clinical significance and another one predicted to be likely benign, were terminated prior to phenotype-genotype correlation (2/10). We demonstrate that the clinical interpretation of structural rearrangements should not be limited to interruption, deletion, or duplication of specific genes and should also incorporate regulatory domains of the human genome with critical ramifications for the control of gene expression. As detailed in this study, our molecular approach to both detecting and interpreting the breakpoints of structural rearrangements yields unparalleled information in comparison to other commonly used first-tier diagnostic methods, such as non-invasive cfDNA screening and microarray analysis, to provide improved genetic counseling for phenotypic outcome in the prenatal setting.

AB OBJECTIVE: Medical errors in the emergency department (ED) occur frequently. Yet, common adverse event detection methods, such as voluntary reporting, miss 90% of adverse events. Our objective was to demonstrate the use of patient-reported data in the ED to assess patient safety, including medical errors.; METHODS: Analysis of patient-reported survey data collected over a 1-year period in a large, academic emergency department. All patients who provided a valid e-mail or cell phone number received a brief electronic survey within 24 hours of their ED encounter by e-mail or text message with Web link. Patients were asked about ED safety-related processes.; RESULTS: From Aug 2012 to July 2013, we sent 52,693 surveys and received 7103 responses (e-mail response rate 25.8%), including 2836 free-text comments (44% of respondents). Approximately 242 (8.5%) of 2836 comments were classified as potential safety issues, including 12 adverse events, 40 near-misses, 23 errors with minimal risk of harm, and 167 general safety issues (eg, gaps in care transitions). Of the 40 near misses, 35 (75.0%) of 40 were preventable. Of the 52 adverse events or near misses, 5 (9.6%) were also identified via an existing patient occurrence reporting system.; CONCLUSIONS: A patient-reported approach to assess ED-patient safety yields important, complementary, and potentially actionable safety information.

AB Natural disasters cause enormous damage to countries all over the world. To deal with these common problems, different activities are required for disaster management at each phase of the crisis. There are three groups of activities as follows: (1) make sense of the situation and determine how best to deal with it, (2) deploy the necessary resources, and (3) harmonize as many parties as possible, using the most effective communication channels. Current technological improvements and developments now enable people to act as real-time information sources. As a result, inundation with crowdsourced data poses a real challenge for a disaster manager. The problem is how to extract the valuable information from a gigantic data pool in the shortest possible time so that the information is still useful and actionable. This research proposed an actionable-data-extraction process to deal with the challenge. Twitter was selected as a test case because messages posted on Twitter are publicly available. Hashtag, an easy and very efficient technique, was also used to differentiate information. A quantitative approach to extract useful information from the tweets was supported and verified by interviews with disaster managers from many leading organizations in Thailand to understand their missions. The information classifications extracted from the collected tweets were first performed manually, and then the tweets were used to train a machine learning algorithm to classify future tweets. One particularly useful, significant, and primary section was the request for help category. The support vector machine algorithm was used to validate the results from the extraction process of 13,696 sample tweets, with over 74 percent accuracy. The results confirmed that the machine learning technique could significantly and practically assist with disaster management by dealing with crowdsourced data.

AB Interest in genomic testing for the selection of cancer therapy is growing. However, the cost of genomic testing has not been well studied. We sought to determine the price of identifying mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in theoretically actionable genes across multiple tumor types. We reviewed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to determine the frequency of alterations in nine tumor types. We used price information from a commonly used commercial genomic testing platform (FoundationOne) to determine the price of detecting mutations and CNAs in different types of tumors. Although there are large variations in the prevalence by tumor type, when the detection of both mutations and CNAs was considered overall, most patients had at least one alteration in a potentially actionable gene (84% overall, range 51%- 98% among tumor types assessed). The corresponding average price of identifying at least one alteration per patient ranges from $5,897 to $11,572. Although the frequency of mutations and CNAs in actionable genes differs by tumor type, most patients have an actionable genomic alteration detectable by a commercially available panel. Determining CNAs as well as mutations improves actionability and reduces the price of detecting an alteration.

AB Compelling evidence suggests that early life exposures can affect lifetime cancer risk. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Cancer Prevention Across the Lifespan Workgroup hosted a series of virtual meetings with select experts to discuss the state of the evidence linking factors during the prenatal period and early childhood to subsequent risk of both pediatric and adult cancers. In this article, we present the results from a qualitative analysis of the meeting transcripts and summarize themes that emerged from our discussions with meeting participants. Themes included the state of the evidence linking early life factors to cancer risk, research gaps and challenges, the level of evidence needed to support taking public health action, and the challenges of communicating complex, and sometimes conflicting, scientific findings to the public. Opportunities for collaboration among public health agencies and other stakeholders were identified during these discussions. Potential next steps for the CDC and its partners included advancing and building upon epidemiology and surveillance work, developing and using evidence from multiple sources to inform decision-making, disseminating and communicating research findings in a clear and effective way, and expanding collaborations with grantees and other partners. As the science on early life factors and cancer risk continues to evolve, there are opportunities for collaboration to translate science into actionable public health practice.

AB Every single-nucleotide change compatible with life is present in the human population today. Understanding these rare human variants defines an extraordinary challenge for genetics and medicine. The new clinical practice of sequencing many genes for hereditary cancer risk has illustrated the utility of clinical next-generation sequencing in adults, identifying more medically actionable variants than single-gene testing. However, it has also revealed a linear relationship between the length of DNA evaluated and the number of rare 'variants of uncertain significance' reported. We propose that careful approaches to phenotype-genotype inference, distinguishing between diagnostic and screening intent, in conjunction with expanded use of family-scale genetics studies as a source of information on family-specific variants, will reduce variants of uncertain significance reported to patients.

AB The emerging availability of genomic and electronic health data in large populations is a powerful tool for research that has drawn interest in bringing precision medicine to diabetes. In this article, we discuss the potential application of genomics to the prediction, prevention, and treatment of diabetes, and we use examples from other areas of medicine to illustrate some of the challenges involved in conducting genomics research in human populations and implementing findings in practice. At this time, a major barrier to the application of genomics in diabetes care is the lack of actionable genomic findings. Whether genomic information should be used in clinical practice requires a framework for evaluating the validity and clinical utility of this approach, an improved integration of genomic data into electronic health records, and the clinical decision support and educational resources for clinicians to use these data. Efforts to identify optimal approaches in all of these domains are in progress and may help to bring diabetes into the era of genomic medicine. © 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB Recently, targeted drugs have been developed for the treatment of colorectal cancer(CRC). Among targets, it is well known that KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)monoclonal antibodies. However, response rates using anti-EGFR monotherapy for CRC were less than 20-30% in previous clinical studies. Thus, because the RAS/MAP2K/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are associated with CRC resistance to chemotherapy, we analyzed gene mutations in Stage IV CRC patients using a genomic test(CancerPlex). Medical records were reviewed for 112 patients who received treatment for CRC between 2007 and 2015 in Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital or Niigata Cancer Center Hospital. There were 66 male and 46 female patients, and their median age was 62.5(range, 30-86) years. Cluster analyses were performed in 110 non-hypermutated Japanese CRC patients using Euclidean distance and Ward's clustering method, and 6 typical groups were identified. Among these, patients with all wild-type actionable genes benefited from anti-EGFR therapies. The expense of targeted drugs warrants consideration of cost-effectiveness during treatment decision-making for advanced CRC patients. To this end, based on the genetic information on CRC, it is possible to develop precision medicine using CancerPlex.

AB Biliary tract cancers (intrahepatic, perihilar and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder and cystic duct cancers) are uncommon but highly lethal malignancies. Clinical presentation is often late, precluding curative surgical resection in most cases. For advanced disease, therapeutic options are limited to systemic chemotherapy, with suboptimal outcomes. An understanding of the molecular characteristics of biliary tract cancers may allow the clinical development of therapies targeting actionable alterations with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes. We present a comprehensive review of biliary tract cancer genomics and their clinical implications. Alterations in genes in the EGFR-MAPK-PI3K pathway are seen most often. KRAS alterations are highly prevalent; BRAF alterations are mutually exclusive from RAS alterations and much less frequent. PIK3CA alterations are seen mostly in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancers whereas HER2 amplification is most common in gallbladder cancers. Various tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and p16 are also altered often in biliary tract cancers; however, agents to "activate" silenced genes are currently lacking. FGF and IDH pathway alterations are potential targets for therapeutic agents. FGF alterations are typically fusions with other genes, resulting in altered proteins, and are seen most often in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. IDH pathway alterations affect cellular enzymatic processes and are most common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials of agents targeting these pathways hold the promise of improving clinical outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and crizotinib are nowadays the optimal treatment for metastatic lung cancer with activation of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement. In addition, several targeted agents are in development for lung cancer with other oncodrivers. In France, since 2011, six oncodrivers are routinely tested in patients with stage IV. The aim of this study was to assess whether systematic detection of oncodrivers and matched targeted therapy improve overall survival in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.; METHODS: This study included all consecutive patients treated in our department for advanced lung adenocarcinoma from January 2012 to December 2013. We studied the impact in survival according to the presence of the driver and the targeted therapy.; RESULTS: Among the 261 patients included, oncodrivers alterations were found in 43.5% of patients: EML4-ALK fusion genes (2.1%), EGFR (10.3%), KRAS (27.7%), BRAF (2.5%), HER2 (0.8%), and PI3KCA (0.8%) mutations. Twenty-nine percent of patients (n=32) with oncodrivers received matched targeted therapy. Patient treated by targeted agent appropriate to an oncogenic driver had a median survival of 21.1 months (95% CI: 14.7-27.5). The patients (n=79) who did not receive targeted therapy had a median survival of 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.3-8.9). The patients (n=150) without identified driver had a median survival of 9.7 months (95% CI: 6.7-11.7); P<0.001.; CONCLUSION: An actionable oncodriver was routinely detected in nearly half of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. This systematic detection may influence treatment outcomes, notably with matched targeted therapy. Copyright © 2016 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: This study was performed to further our understanding of the biological and genetic basis of follicular lymphoma and to identify potential novel therapy targets.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed previously generated whole exome sequencing data of 23 follicular lymphoma cases and one transformed follicular lymphoma case and expanded findings to a combined total of 125 follicular lymphoma/3 transformed follicular lymphoma. We modeled the three-dimensional location of RRAGC-associated hotspot mutations. We performed functional studies on novel RRAGC mutants in stable retrovirally transduced HEK293T cells, stable lentivirally transduced lymphoma cell lines, and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RESULTS: We report recurrent mutations, including multiple amino acid hotspots, in the small G-protein RRAGC, which is part of a protein complex that signals intracellular amino acid concentrations to MTOR, in 9.4% of follicular lymphoma cases. Mutations in RRAGC distinctly clustered on one protein surface area surrounding the GTP/GDP-binding sites. Mutated RRAGC proteins demonstrated increased binding to RPTOR (raptor) and substantially decreased interactions with the product of the tumor suppressor gene FLCN (folliculin). In stable retrovirally transfected 293T cells, cultured in the presence or absence of leucine, multiple RRAGC mutations demonstrated elevated MTOR activation as evidenced by increased RPS6KB/S6-kinase phosphorylation. Similar activation phenotypes were uncovered in yeast engineered to express mutations in the RRAGC homolog Gtr2 and in multiple lymphoma cell lines expressing HA-tagged RRAGC-mutant proteins.; CONCLUSIONS: Our discovery of activating mutations in RRAGC in approximately 10% of follicular lymphoma provides the mechanistic rationale to study mutational MTOR activation and MTOR inhibition as a potential novel actionable therapeutic target in follicular lymphoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Pathology laboratories are required to immediately report results which indicate a patient is at critical risk, but there is little consensus about what values are deemed critical. The aim of this review was to systematically review the literature on alert thresholds for common chemistry and hematology tests in adults and to provide an explicit and ranked source of this evidence.; METHODS: The literature search covered the period of 1995-2014. Evidence sources were critically appraised and ranked using the 1999 Stockholm hierarchy for analytical performance specifications in laboratory medicine modified for establishing decision limits.; RESULTS: The 30 most frequently reported laboratory tests with alert thresholds are presented with evidence rankings. Similar thresholds were reported in North America, Europe and Asia. Seventy percent of papers reported thresholds set by individual institutions, while 18% contained thresholds from surveys of laboratories or clinicians. Forty-six percent of the papers referred to 1 or both of the 2 American laboratory surveys from the early 1990s. "Starter sets" of alert thresholds were recommended by 6 professional bodies, 3 of which were collaborations between pathologists and clinicians. None of the 9 outcome studies identified dealt with confounding factors.; CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations by professional bodies based on outdated surveys of the former state of the art or consensus are currently the best sources of evidence for laboratories to build their alert list. Well-designed outcome studies and greater collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory are needed to identify the most appropriate alert thresholds that signify actionable, critical or significant risk to patient well-being. © 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB OBJECTIVE: A key aspect of the precision medicine effort is the development of informatics tools that can analyze and interpret "big data" sets in an automated and adaptive fashion while providing accurate and actionable clinical information.The aims of this study were to develop machine learning algorithms for the identification of disease and the prognostication of mortality risk and to determine whether such models perform better than classical statistical analyses.; METHODS: Focusing on peripheral artery disease (PAD), patient data were derived from a prospective, observational study of 1755 patients who presented for elective coronary angiography. We employed multiple supervised machine learning algorithmsand used diverse clinical, demographic, imaging, and genomic information in a hypothesis-free manner to build models that could identify patients with PAD and predict future mortality. Comparison was made to standard stepwise linear regression models.; RESULTS: Our machine-learned models outperformed stepwise logistic regression models both for the identification of patients with PAD (area under the curve, 0.87 vs 0.76, respectively; P= .03) and for the prediction of future mortality (area under the curve, 0.76 vs 0.65, respectively; P= .10). Both machine-learned models were markedly better calibrated than the stepwise logistic regression models, thus providing more accurate disease and mortality risk estimates.; CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning approaches can produce more accurate disease classification and prediction models. These tools may prove clinically useful for the automated identification of patients with highly morbid diseases for which aggressive risk factor management can improve outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the timing, trajectory, and implications of hypercalcemia in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) through a multicenter retrospective study.; STUDY DESIGN: Data on plasma calcium levels from 232 subjects with WBS aged 0-67.1 years were compared with that in controls and also with available normative data. Association testing was used to identify relevant comorbidities.; RESULTS: On average, individuals with WBS had higher plasma calcium levels than controls, but 86.7% of values were normal. Nonpediatric laboratories overreport hypercalcemia in small children. When pediatric reference intervals were applied, the occurrence of hypercalcemia dropped by 51% in infants and by 38% in toddlers. Across all ages, 6.1% of the subjects had actionable hypercalcemia. In children, actionable hypercalcemia was seen in those aged 5-25 months. In older individuals, actionable hypercalcemia was often secondary to another disease process. Evidence of dehydration, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis were common in both groups. Future hypercalcemia could not be reliably predicted by screening calcium levels. A subgroup analysis of 91 subjects found no associations between hypercalcemia and cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal complaints, or renal anomalies. Analyses of electrogradiography data showed an inverse correlation of calcium concentration with corrected QT interval, but no acute life-threatening events were reported.; CONCLUSIONS: Actionable hypercalcemia in patients with WBS occurs infrequently. Although irritability and lethargy were commonly reported, no mortality or acute life-threatening events were associated with hypercalcemia and the only statistically associated morbidities were dehydration, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although several non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants have been developed to prevent cardiogenic thrombosis, the status of hemorrhagic complications in the clinical setting among Asian populations, including Japan, remains unclear. We conducted this retrospective cohort study to clarify the current status of hemorrhagic events during antithrombotic therapy with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants, with particular focus on gastrointestinal bleeding.; METHODS: Medical charts of 475 patients prescribed dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban between April 2011 and September 2014 were reviewed to examine whether any hemorrhagic events occurred, compared with 135 patients who received warfarin between April 2009 and March 2011.; RESULTS: Incidences of total and actionable hemorrhage in patient taking non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants were 13.8% per year and 4.6% per year, respectively, showing no significant differences from those in warfarin users (9.3% per year and 5.0% per year, respectively). In addition, actionable gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at similar rates in non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants users (2.1% per year) and warfarin users (1.5% per year). Most hemorrhages were from the lower gastrointestinal tract, and considerable events involved perianal bleeding. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy, and concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy were significant factors related to actionable gastrointestinal bleeding.; CONCLUSIONS: Risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients taking non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants was similar to that in patients taking warfarin. The dominant bleeding site was the lower gastrointestinal tract. .

AB Chemotherapy is the primary established systemic treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in both the early and advanced-stages of the disease. The lack of targeted therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with TNBC have fostered a major effort to discover actionable molecular targets to treat patients with these tumours. Massively parallel sequencing and other 'omics' technologies have revealed an unexpected level of heterogeneity of TNBCs and have led to the identification of potentially actionable molecular features in some TNBCs, such as germline BRCA1/2 mutations or 'BRCAness', the presence of the androgen receptor, and several rare genomic alterations. Whether these alterations are molecular 'drivers', however, has not been clearly established. A subgroup of TNBCs shows a high degree of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes that also correlates with a lower risk of disease relapse and a higher likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy. Proof-of-principle studies with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in advanced-stage TNBC have yielded promising results, indicating the potential benefit of immunotherapy for patients with TNBC. In this Review, we discuss the most relevant molecular findings in TNBC from the past decade and the most promising therapeutic opportunities derived from these data.

AB OBJECTIVE: The WHO application of the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) to deaths during the perinatal period (ICD Perinatal Mortality, ICD-PM) captures the essential characteristics of the mother-baby dyad that contribute to perinatal deaths. We compare the capture of maternal conditions in the existing ICD-PM with the maternal codes from the WHO application of ICD-10 to deaths during pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (ICD Maternal Mortality, ICD-MM) to explore potential benefits in the quality of data received.; DESIGN: Retrospective application of ICD-PM.; SETTING: South Africa and the UK.; POPULATION: Perinatal death databases.; METHODS: The maternal conditions were classified using the ICD-PM groupings for maternal condition in perinatal death, and then mapped to the ICD-MM groupings of maternal conditions.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main maternal conditions in perinatal deaths.; RESULTS: We reviewed 9661 perinatal deaths. The largest group (4766 cases, 49.3%) in both classifications captures deaths where there was no contributing maternal condition. Each of the other ICD-PM groups map to between three and six ICD-MM groups. If the cases in each ICD-PM group are re-coded using ICD-MM, each group becomes multiple, more specific groups. For example, the 712 cases in group M4 in ICD-PM become 14 different and more specific main disease categories when the ICD-MM is applied instead.; CONCLUSIONS: As we move towards ICD-11, the use of the more specific, applicable, and relevant codes outlined in ICD-MM for both maternal deaths and the maternal condition at the time of a perinatal death would be preferable, and would provide important additional information about perinatal deaths.; TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Improving the capture of maternal conditions in perinatal deaths provides important actionable information. © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists The World Health Organization retains copyright and all other rights in the manuscript of this article as submitted for publication.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk factors and timing of perioperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) and its association with survival for patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) in routine clinical practice.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: The population-based Ontario Cancer Registry was linked to electronic records of treatment to identify all patients who underwent RC between 1994 and 2008; VTE events were identified from hospital diagnostic codes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with perioperative VTE. A Cox proportional hazards regression model explored the associations between VTE and survival.; RESULTS: Of the 3879 patients included in the study, 3.6% (141 patients) were diagnosed with VTE at ≤1month of their surgical admission date. This increased to 4.7% (181) at ≤2months and 5.4% (211) at ≤3months. In all, 55% of VTE events presented after hospital discharge. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with VTE included higher surgeon volume (P = 0.004) and increased length of hospital stay (LOS; P < 0.001). Lymph node yield and adjuvant chemotherapy were not associated with VTE. VTE was associated with an inferior cancer-specific survival [hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.62] and overall survival (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08-1.49).; CONCLUSIONS: Over half of VTE events in RC patients occur after hospital discharge, with a substantial incidence up to 3months after surgery. Limited actionable risk factors for VTE were identified other than LOS. In this population-based cohort, VTE was associated with inferior long-term survival. © 2016 The Authors BJU International © 2016 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common parasomnia disorder affecting between 1 and 7% of community-dwelling adults, most frequently older adults. RBD is characterized by nocturnal complex motor behavior and polysomnographic REM sleep without atonia. RBD is strongly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration. The approach to RBD management is currently twofold: symptomatic treatment to prevent injury and prognostic counseling and longitudinal follow-up surveillance for phenoconversion toward overt neurodegenerative disorders. The focus of this review is symptomatic treatment for injury prevention. Injury occurs in up to 55% of patients prior to treatment, even when most behaviors seem to be infrequent or minor, so patients with RBD should be treated promptly following diagnosis to prevent injury risk. A sound evidence basis for symptomatic treatment of RBD remains lacking, and randomized controlled treatment trials are needed. Traditional therapeutic mainstays with relatively robust retrospective case series level evidence include melatonin and clonazepam, which appear to be equally effective, although melatonin is more tolerable. Melatonin also has one small randomized controlled crossover trial supporting its use for RBD treatment. Melatonin dosed 3-12mg at bedtime should be considered as the first-line therapy, followed by clonazepam 0.25-2.0mg at bedtime if initial melatonin is judged ineffective or intolerable. However, neither agent is likely to completely stop dream enactment behaviors, so choosing a moderate target dosage of melatonin 6mg or clonazepam 0.5mg, or the highest tolerable dosage that reduces attack frequency and avoids adverse effects from overtreatment, is currently the most reasonable strategy. Alternative second- and third-line therapies with anecdotal efficacy include temazepam, lorazepam, zolpidem, zopiclone, pramipexole, donepezil, ramelteon, agomelatine, cannabinoids, and sodium oxybate. A novel non-pharmacological approach is a bed alarm system, although this may be most useful in patients who also report sleep walking or a history of leaving their bed during dream enactment episodes. The benefit of hypnosis, especially in those with psychiatric RBD, also requires further study. RBD is an attractive target for future neuroprotective treatment trials to prevent evolution of overt parkinsonism or memory decline, but currently, there are no known effective treatments and future trials will be necessary to determine if RBD is an actionable time point in the evolution of overt synucleinopathy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Parent use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) while around their young children may be associated with fewer or more negative parent-child interactions, but parent perspectives regarding this issue have not been explored. We aimed to understand parent views regarding their mobile device use to identify actionable targets of potential intervention.; METHOD: We conducted 35 in-depth semi-structured group and individual interviews with English-speaking caregivers of children 0 to 8 years old, purposively sampled from diverse ethnic backgrounds, educational levels, and employment statuses. Following thematic saturation, results were validated through expert triangulation and member checking.; RESULTS: Participants included 22 mothers, 9 fathers, and 4 grandmothers; 31% were single parents, 43% nonwhite race/ethnicity, and 40% completed high school or less. Participants consistently expressed a high degree of internal tension regarding their own mobile technology use, which centered around 3 themes relevant to intervention planning: (1) Cognitive tensions (multitasking between work and children, leading to information/role overload), (2) emotional tensions (stress-inducing and reducing effects), and (3) tensions around the parent-child dyad (disrupting family routines vs serving as a tool to keep the peace).; CONCLUSION: Caregivers of young children describe many internal conflicts regarding their use of mobile technology, which may be windows for intervention. Helping caregivers understand such emotional and cognitive responses may help them balance family time with technology-based demands.

AB BACKGROUND: The frequency with which targeted tumor sequencing results will lead to implemented change in care is unclear. Prospective assessment of the feasibility and limitations of using genomic sequencing is critically important.; METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted on 100 patients with diverse-histology, rare, or poor-prognosis cancers to evaluate the clinical actionability of a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, comprehensive genomic profiling assay (FoundationOne), using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. The primary objectives were to assess utility, feasibility, and limitations of genomic sequencing for genomically guided therapy or other clinical purpose in the setting of a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board.; RESULTS: Of the tumors from the 92 patients with sufficient tissue, 88 (96%) had at least one genomic alteration (average 3.6, range 0-10). Commonly altered pathways included p53 (46%), RAS/RAF/MAPK (rat sarcoma; rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; mitogen-activated protein kinase) (45%), receptor tyrosine kinases/ligand (44%), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; protein kinase B; mammalian target of rapamycin) (35%), transcription factors/regulators (31%), and cell cycle regulators (30%). Many low frequency but potentially actionable alterations were identified in diverse histologies. Use of comprehensive profiling led to implementable clinical action in 35% of tumors with genomic alterations, including genomically guided therapy, diagnostic modification, and trigger for germline genetic testing.; CONCLUSION: Use of targeted next-generation sequencing in the setting of an institutional molecular tumor board led to implementable clinical action in more than one third of patients with rare and poor-prognosis cancers. Major barriers to implementation of genomically guided therapy were clinical status of the patient and drug access. Early and serial sequencing in the clinical course and expanded access to genomically guided early-phase clinical trials and targeted agents may increase actionability.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Identification of key factors that facilitate use of genomic tumor testing results and implementation of genomically guided therapy may lead to enhanced benefit for patients with rare or difficult to treat cancers. Clinical use of a targeted next-generation sequencing assay in the setting of an institutional molecular tumor board led to implementable clinical action in over one third of patients with rare and poor prognosis cancers. The major barriers to implementation of genomically guided therapy were clinical status of the patient and drug access both on trial and off label. Approaches to increase actionability include early and serial sequencing in the clinical course and expanded access to genomically guided early phase clinical trials and targeted agents. ©AlphaMed Press.

AB Purpose: Intraocular medulloepithelioma (IM), the second most common primary neuroepithelial tumor of the eye, can lead to blindness in the affected eye and in rare cases, is deadly. Intraocular medulloepithelioma lacks targetable biomarkers for potential pharmacologic therapy. The purpose of this study was to identify actionable, tumor-specific proteins for potential diagnostic or therapeutic strategies. We hypothesize that the tumor-specific epigenetic enzyme EZH2 is selectively expressed in IM.; Methods: We conducted a retrospective case series study of five IM from five eyes of four children and one adult. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of IM tumors were used to localize IM tumor cells in each case. Using an EZH2-specific antibody for immunohistochemistry, we semiquantitatively calculated the proportion of IM tumor cells positive for EZH2, and also assayed for EZH2 staining intensity.; Results: We found that EZH2 was expressed in all IM cases but this protein was absent in nontumor ciliary body or retinal tissues. However, not all IM tumor cells expressed EZH2. Similar to retinoblastoma, moderately to poorly differentiated (primitive appearing) IM tumor cells strongly expressed EZH2; expression was weaker or absent in areas of well-formed neuroepithelial units.; Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify an actionable tumor-specific maker, EZH2, in IM. Our findings point to the possibility of exploring the potential of EZH2 inhibitors, already in clinical trials for other cancers, for IM.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a very large effect (VLE; defined as a relative risk of ≤0.2 or ≥5) in a randomised trial could be an empirical marker that subsequent trials are unnecessary.; DESIGN: Meta-epidemiological assessment of existing published data on randomised trials.; DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010, issue 7) with data on subsequent large trials updated to 2015, issue 12.; ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All binary outcome forest plots were selected, which contained an index randomised trial with a VLE that was nominally statistically significant (P<0.05), included a subsequent large randomised trial (≥200 events and ≥200 non-events) for validation of the effect, assessed a primary outcome of the review, and was not a subgroup or sensitivity analysis.; RESULTS: Of 3082 reviews yielding 85002 forest plots, only 44 (0.05%) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Index trials were generally small, with a median sample of 99 (median 14 events). Few index trials were rated at low risk of bias (9 of 44; 20%). The relative risk was closer to the null in the subsequent large trials in 43 of 44 cases. Subsequent large trial data failed to find a statistically significant (P<0.05) effect in the same direction in 19 cases (43%, 95% confidence interval 29% to 58%). Even when the subsequent large trials did find a significant effect in the same direction, the additional primary outcomes in most of these trials would have to be considered before deciding in favour of using the intervention. Subsequent large trial data found a statistically significant effect in the same direction in 19 of 21 cases when the index trial also had a value of P<0.001.; CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of VLEs followed by a large trial is vanishingly small, and where they occur they do not appear to be a reliable marker for a benefit that is reproducible and directly actionable. An empirical rule using a VLE in a randomised controlled trial as a marker that further trials are unnecessary would be neither practical nor useful. Caution should be taken when interpreting small studies with very large treatment effects. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB There is a vital need for improved therapeutic strategies that are effective in both primary and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Current treatment options for TNBC patients are restricted to chemotherapy; however tyrosine kinases are promising druggable targets due to their high expression in multiple TNBC subtypes. Since coexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can promote signaling crosstalk and cell survival in the presence of kinase inhibitors, it is likely that multiple RTKs will need to be inhibited to enhance therapeutic benefit and prevent resistance. The MET and EGFR receptors are actionable targets due to their high expression in TNBC; however crosstalk between MET and EGFR has been implicated in therapeutic resistance to single agent use of MET or EGFR inhibitors in several cancer types. Therefore it is likely that dual inhibition of MET and EGFR is required to prevent crosstalk signaling and acquired resistance. In this study, we evaluated the heterogeneity of MET and EGFR expression and activation in primary and metastatic TNBC tumorgrafts and determined the efficacy of MET (MGCD265 or crizotinib) and/or EGFR (erlotinib) inhibition against TNBC progression. Here we demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition with either MGCD265 and erlotinib treatment or crizotinib and erlotinib treatment were highly effective at abrogating tumor growth and significantly decreased the variability in treatment response compared to monotherapy. These results advance our understanding of the RTK signaling architecture in TNBC and demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients.

AB In this communication we introduce an efficient implementation of adaptive biasing that greatly improves the speed of free energy computation in molecular dynamics simulations. We investigated the use of accelerated simulations to inform on compound design using a recently reported and clinically relevant inhibitor of the chromatin regulator BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4). Benchmarking on our local compute cluster, our implementation achieves up to 2.5 times more force calls per day than plumed2. Results of five 1 mus-long simulations are presented, which reveal a conformational switch in the BRD4 inhibitor between a binding competent and incompetent state. Stabilization of the switch led to a -3 kcal/mol improvement of absolute binding free energy. These studies suggest an unexplored ligand design principle and offer new actionable hypotheses for medicinal chemistry efforts against this druggable epigenetic target class.

AB PURPOSE: Although the link between mutant TP53 and human cancer is unequivocal, a significant knowledge gap exists in clinically actionable molecular targets in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a highly penetrant cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline mutations in TP53. This study surveyed the epigenome to identify functionally and clinically relevant novel genes implicated in LFS.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genome-wide methylation analyses of peripheral blood leukocyte DNA in germline TP53 mutation carriers (n = 72) and individuals with TP53 wild type in whom histologically comparable malignancies developed (n = 111). Targeted bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed on a validation cohort of 30 TP53 mutation carriers and 46 patients with TP53 wild type, and candidate sites were evaluated in primary tumors from patients with LFS across multiple histologic tumor types.; RESULTS: In 183 patients, distinct DNA methylation signatures were associated with deleterious TP53 mutations in peripheral blood leukocytes. TP53-associated DNA methylation marks occurred in genomic regions that harbored p53 binding sites and in genes encoding p53 pathway proteins. Moreover, loss-of-function TP53 mutations were significantly associated with differential methylation at the locus encoding microRNA miR-34A, a key component of the p53 regulatory network (adjusted P < .001), and validated in an independent patient cohort (n = 76, P < .001). Targeted bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrated that miR-34A was inactivated by hypermethylation across many histologic types of primary tumors from patients with LFS. Moreover, miR-34A tumor hypermethylation was associated with decreased overall survival in a cohort of 29 patients with choroid plexus carcinomas, a characteristic LFS tumor (P < .05).; CONCLUSION: Epigenetic dysregulation of miR-34A may comprise an important path in TP53-associated cancer predisposition and represents a therapeutically actionable target with potential clinical relevance.

AB The development of targeted therapies for both germline and somatic DNA mutations has increased the need for molecular profiling assays to determine the mutational status of specific genes. Moreover, the potential of off-label prescription of targeted therapies favors classifying tumors based on DNA alterations rather than traditional tissue pathology. Here we describe the analytical validation of a custom probe-based NGS tumor panel, TumorNext, which can detect single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions in 142 genes that are frequently mutated in somatic and/or germline cancers. TumorNext also detects gene fusions and structural variants, such as tandem duplications and inversions, in 15 frequently disrupted oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The assay uses a matched control and custom bioinformatics pipeline to differentiate between somatic and germline mutations, allowing precise variant classification. We tested 170 previously characterized samples, of which > 95% were formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue from 8 different cancer types, and highlight examples where lack of germline status may have led to the inappropriate prescription of therapy. We also describe the validation of the Affymetrix OncoScan platform, an array technology for high resolution copy number variant detection for use in parallel with the NGS panel that can detect single copy amplifications and hemizygous deletions. We analyzed 80 previously characterized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and provide examples of hemizygous deletion detection in samples with known pathogenic germline mutations. Thus, the TumorNext combined approach of NGS and OncoScan potentially allows for the identification of the "second hit" in hereditary cancer patients.

AB Clinically applicable platforms revealing actionable genomic alterations may improve the treatment efficacy of myeloma patients. In this pilot study, we used a high depth targeted sequencing panel containing 83 anti-cancer drug target genes to sequence genomic DNAs extracted from bone marrow aspirates of 23 patients with myeloma and 12 patients with amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Mutation analysis revealed NRAS as the most commonly mutated gene (30%, 7/23) in myeloma patients followed by KRAS (26%, 6/23) and BRAF (22%, 5/23). However, no significant mutations were found in the 12 patients with AL amyloidosis. Notably, 6 of the 23 myeloma patients showed multi-site and/or multi-gene mutations in NRAS, KRAS, or BRAF, indicating compound aberrations in the Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Gene panel sequencing also revealed cytogenetic abnormalities associated with prognosis in myeloma patients. In conclusion, our pilot study suggests that targeted gene sequencing may have an important prognostic value for myeloma patients for the identification of actionable genomic alterations and cytogenetic aberrations.

AB Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study. KAT2A inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells. Our results propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia that can be pursued in downstream studies.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) has become part of molecular pathology diagnostics for determining RAS mutation status in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients as predictive tool for decision on EGFR-targeted therapy. Here, we investigated mutation profiles of case-matched tissue specimens throughout the disease course of CRC, to further specify RAS-status dynamics and to identify de novo mutations associated with distant metastases.; METHODS: Case-matched formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) resection specimens (n=70; primary tumours, synchronous and/or metachronous liver and/or lung metastases) of 14 CRC cases were subjected to microdissection of normal colonic epithelial, primary and metastatic tumour cells, their DNA extraction and an adapted library protocol for limited DNA using the 48 gene TruSeq Amplicon Cancer PanelTM, MiSeq sequencing and data analyses (Illumina).; RESULTS: By tNGS primary tumours were RAS wildtype in 5/14 and mutated in 9/14 (8/9 KRAS exon 2; 1/9 NRAS Exon 3) of cases. RAS mutation status was maintained in case-matched metastases throughout the disease course, albeit with altered allele frequencies. Case-matched analyses further identified a maximum of three sequence variants (mainly in APC, KRAS, NRAS, TP53) shared by all tumour specimens throughout the disease course per individual case. In addition, further case-matched de novo mutations were detected in synchronous and/or metachronous liver and/or lung metastases (e.g. in APC, ATM, FBXW7, FGFR3, GNAQ, KIT, PIK3CA, PTEN, SMAD4, SMO, STK11, TP53, VHL). Moreover, several de novo mutations were more frequent in synchronous (e.g. ATM, KIT, PIK3CA, SMAD4) or metachronous (e.g. FBXW7, SMO, STK11) lung metastases. Finally, some de novo mutations occurred only in metachronous lung metastases (CDKN2A, FGFR2, GNAS, JAK3, SRC).; CONCLUSION: Together, this study employs an adapted FFPE-based tNGS approach to confirm conservation of RAS mutation status in primary and metastatic tissue specimens of CRC patients. Moreover, it identifies genes preferentially mutated de novo in late disease stages of metachronous CRC lung metastases, several of which might be actionable by targeted therapies.

AB INTRODUCTION: The potential of oncogene-driven targeted therapy is perhaps most fully realized in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), given the number of genomic targets and approved matched therapies. However, invasive tissue biopsy at the time of each disease progression may not be possible and is associated with high morbidity and cost. Use of newly available "liquid biopsies" can circumvent these issues.; RESULTS: 83% of subjects had at least one genomic alteration identified in plasma. Most commonly mutated genes were TP53, KRAS and EGFR. Subjects with no detectable ctDNA were more likely to have small volume disease, lepidic growth pattern, mucinous tumors or isolated leptomeningeal disease.; METHODS: Subjects were individuals with NSCLC undergoing analysis of cell-free circulating tumor DNA using a validated, commercially-available next-generation sequencing assay at a single institution. Demographic, clinicopathologic information and results from tissue and plasma-based genomic testing were reviewed for each subject.; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinic-based series of NSCLC patients assessing outcomes of targeted therapies using a commercially available ctDNA assay. Over 80% of patients had detectable ctDNA, concordance between paired tissue and blood for truncal oncogenic drivers was high and patients with biomarkers identified in plasma had PFS in the expected range. These data suggest that biopsy-free ctDNA analysis is a viable first choice when the diagnostic tissue biopsy is insufficient for genotyping or at the time of progression when a repeated invasive tissue biopsy is not possible/preferred.

AB During the last decade the therapeutic landscape of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) has profoundly changed with the identification of actionable genetic alterations that defined molecularly selected subgroups of patients with specific clinic-pathological characteristics and increased sensitivity to specific targeted agents. The presence of ROS1 rearrangements defines a small subgroup of lung adenocarcinomas (1-2%) with peculiar clinic-pathological characteristics and increased sensitivity to Crizotinib. It has been reported that ROS1-tranlslocated NSCLCs may also respond well to Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Moreover, patients with oncogene-addicted NSCLC may present peculiar pattern of metastatization and, in some instances, are associated with unusual site of metastases. Herein, we present a case of a young woman with bilateral ovarian metastases from a ROS1-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung with a lengthy progression-free survival on Pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy.

AB The gastrointestinal microbiome has become a topic of great interest in medicine in recent years. Genomic sequencing can now be done at a fraction of the cost of a few years ago, and this has allowed for the development and compilation of an extensive amount of data related to the species diversity of the human gastrointestinal microbiome.1 Studies have demonstrated that the intestinal microbiome is sensitive to the composition of the diet.2 It is also recognized that the composition of the microbiome can be altered rapidly in response to dietary changes, stress, chemical exposure, and exercise.3 Both the expanded understanding of the composition of the human microbiome and the ability to measure it through genomic analysis of the stool have resulted in clinicians frequently wanting to know what actionable conclusions can be taken away from an analysis of the gastrointestinal microbiome.

AB The late appearance of the 'M' on the international health agenda - in its own right and not just as a carrier of the intrauterine passenger - is thought-provoking. The 'M' was absent for decades in textbooks of 'tropical medicine' until the rhetoric question was formulated: 'Where is the "M" in MCH?' The selective antenatal 'high-risk approach' gained momentum but had to give way to the fact that all pregnant women are at risk due to unforeseeable complications. In order to provide trained staff to master such complications in impoverished rural areas (with no doctors), some countries have embarked on training of non-physician clinicians/associate clinicians for major surgery with excellent results in 'task-shifting' practice. The alleged but non-existent 'human right' to survive birth demonstrates that there have been no concrete accountability and no 'legal teeth' to make a failing accountability legally actionable to guarantee such a right.

AB The pathology of biliary carcinomas is diverse with different gross and histological features in tumors arising in the different segments of the biliary system. Various epidemiological risk factors, varied genetic makeup, and tissue microenvironment are contributory factors. As biliary tumors have been shown to be a part of the Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum, it is plausible to speculate that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency plays a role in biliary tumors. Literature data suggest that DNA MMR deficiency indeed occurs in these tumors, albeit infrequently with the reported frequencies (weighted for sample size) of high level microsatellite instability (MSI) being 5% each for gallbladder carcinoma and carcinoma of extra-hepatic bile ducts, and 10% each for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma. Importantly, the presence of MMR deficiency in these tumors has been shown to have different implications with regard to its association with Lynch syndrome, tumor histological features, and other clinical characteristics, when compared with non-biliary tumors or among the biliary tumors from the different segments of the biliary system. Ongoing and future efforts that utilize large scale sequencing techniques and aim at detecting actionable molecular targets should emphasize a multidisciplinary approach that integrates genomic discoveries with not only functional studies but also studies of tumor pathology and the tumor's clinical and biological behavior.

AB Biliary tract cancers represent an uncommon, heterogenous malignant group of tumors that include gallbladder cancers (GBC) and cholangiocarcinomas that are frequently detected in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. The randomized phase III ABC-02 trial established the combination regimen of cisplatin plus gemcitabine as standard of care therapy. Nevertheless, despite prior and subsequent attempts utilizing a variety of treatment strategies clinical outcomes for these cancers remains disappointing, necessitating the innate call for improvements in treatment approaches. In this article, we provide an overview of prior first line studies of single, doublet and triplet systemic chemotherapy regimens as well as attempts to incorporate agents that target the EGFR and VEGF pathways in combination with a cytotoxic backbone and the current role of chemotherapy in the second line setting. Additionally, molecular profiling has the capability to identify genetic alterations to help guide rational treatment approaches; we highlight the molecular diverse profile within biliary cancer and the prior, current and emergent role of targeted therapy in biliary cancers as well as the ongoing investigational assessment of immunotherapy. Overall, combination therapy is superior to single agent therapy in the first line setting. For second line therapy, enrollment on to clinical trials is paramount as no standard of care currently exists and no specific regimen has shown a significant better outcome. Limitations of chemotherapy have been exposed and future trials must have a logical design with incorporation of biomarkers that can aid prognosis or predict benefit to therapy. Advances in genomic sequencing can allow identification of potential actionable targets that can be exploited therapeutically which is already underway with the targeting of FGFR2 fusions and IDH1/2 mutations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). With these approaches there is potential to gain improvements in outcomes for patients affected by these adverse group of cancers.

AB Tumorigenesis is a multistep process involving genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive somatic evolution from normal human cells to malignant derivatives. Collectively, genetic and epigenetic alterations might be combined into biomarkers for the assessment of risk, the detection of early stage tumors, and accurate tumor characterization before and after treatment. Recent efforts have provided systematic approaches to cancer genomics through the application of massive sequencing of specific tumor types. Here, we review biomarkers of genome instability and epigenetics. Cancer evolvability and adaptation emerge through genetic and epigenetic lesions of a variety of sizes and qualities-from point mutations and small insertions/deletions to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, alterations in whole chromosome copy number, preferential allelic expression of cancer risk alleles, and mechanisms that increase tumor mutation rates. We also review specific epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate or hinder tumor adaptation, including DNA methylation, histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, transcription factor activity, and small non-coding RNAs. Given the complexity of the carcinogenic process, the challenge ahead will be to interpret disparate signals across hundreds of genes and summarize these signals into a single actionable diagnosis that translates into specific treatments. Another challenge is to refine preventive efforts through the identification of epigenetic processes that mediate increased cancer rates in individuals exposed to sources of toxic environmental stress and pollution, specially through development and early childhood.

AB INTRODUCTION: In 2006, the World Health Organization launched the Global Age-Friendly Cities Project to support active aging. Canada has a large number of age-friendly initiatives; however, little is known about the effectiveness and outcomes of age-friendly community (AFC) initiatives. In addition, stakeholders report that they lack the capacity and tools to develop and conduct evaluations of their AFC initiatives. In order to address these gaps, the Public Health Agency of Canada developed indicators to support the evaluation of AFC initiatives relevant to a wide range of Canadian communities. These indicators meet the varied needs of communities, but are not designed to evaluate collective impact or enable crosscommunity comparisons.; METHODS: An evidence-based, iterative consultation approach was used to develop indicators for AFCs. This involved a literature review and an environmental scan. Two rounds of key expert and stakeholder consultations were conducted to rate potential indicators according to their importance, actionability and feasibility. A final list of indicators and potential measures were developed based on results from these consultations, as well as key policy considerations.; RESULTS: Thirty-nine indicators emerged across eight AFC domains plus four indicators related to long-term health and social outcomes. All meet the intended purpose of evaluating AFC initiatives at the community level. A user-friendly guide is available to support and share this work.; CONCLUSION: The AFC indicators can help communities evaluate age-friendly initiatives, which is the final step in completing a cycle of the Pan-Canadian AFC milestones. Communities are encouraged to use the evaluation results to improve their AFC initiatives, thereby benefiting a broad range of Canadians. 
A2 INTRODUCTION: En 2006, lOrganisation mondiale de la Sante (OMS) a lance
   le projet mondial  Villes-amies des aines  afin de favoriser un
   vieillissement actif. Si un grand nombre dinitiatives  amies des aines 
   ont ete mises en oeuvre au Canada, on dispose de peu dinformation sur
   lefficacite et les resultats des initiatives des collectivites-amies des
   aines (CAA). En outre, les intervenants affirment quils nont pas la
   capacite et les outils necessaires pour elaborer et realiser des
   evaluations relatives a leurs initiatives de CAA. Afin de pallier ces
   lacunes, lAgence de la sante publique du Canada a mis au point des
   indicateurs pour levaluation des initiatives de CAA dans de nombreuses
   collectivites canadiennes. Ces indicateurs, destines a repondre aux
   differents besoins des collectivites, ne sont pas concus pour faire
   levaluation de repercussions collectives ou pour rendre possible une
   comparaison entre collectivites.METHODOLOGIE: Une demarche de
   consultation iterative fondee sur des donnees probantes a ete employee
   pour lelaboration dindicateurs relatifs aux CAA. Elle a necessite une
   revue de la litterature et une analyse du contexte. Deux rondes de
   consultation aupres dexperts et dintervenants cles ont ete menees, ce
   qui a permis de classer les indicateurs potentiels en fonction de leur
   importance, de leur capacite a etre mis en pratique et de leur
   faisabilite. Une liste definitive dindicateurs et de mesures
   potentielles a ensuite ete mise au point, en fonction des resultats de
   ces consultations et de considerations cles relatives aux
   politiques.RESULTATS: Trente-neuf indicateurs repartis en huit domaines
   relevant des CAA et quatre indicateurs relevant des resultats lies a la
   sante et aux conditions sociales a long terme ont ete selectionnes. Tous
   sont conformes a lobjectif enonce, a savoir levaluation des initiatives
   de CAA a lechelon local. Un guide convivial est disponible pour soutenir
   et diffuser ce travail.CONCLUSION: Les indicateurs de CAA sont
   susceptibles daider les collectivites a proceder a levaluation de leurs
   initiatives amies des aines, ce qui constitue la derniere etape du cycle
   des jalons pancanadiens des CAA. Les collectivites sont en effet
   encouragees a ameliorer leurs initiatives amies des aines a partir de
   levaluation de leurs resultats, afin den faire profiter un large
   eventail de Canadiens.

AB Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are relatively uncommon orphan tumors that have an aggressive disease course and a poor clinical outcome. Surgery is the only curative treatment, but most patients present with advanced disease and therefore have a limited survival. Gemcitabine and cisplatin based chemotherapy has been the only widely accepted standard systemic therapy regimen in these patients but these tumors can be chemoresistant, further complicating their management. In recent times, there has been considerable research in the genetics of BTC and with the advent of new, advanced technologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS) we are achieving a greater understanding of its disease biology. With the help of NGS, we have now been able to identify actionable mutations such as in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), FGFR2, BRAF and HER2/neu genes for targeted therapeutics and correlate the genetic variations with distinct clinical prognoses. This recent genetic information has the potential to make precision medicine a part of routine clinical practice for the management of BTC patients.

AB The reimbursement structure of the US health care system is shifting from a volume-based system to a value-based system. Adopting a comprehensive data analytics platform has become important to health care facilities, in part to navigate this shift. Hospitals generate plenty of data, but actionable analytics are necessary to help personnel interpret and apply data to improve practice. Perioperative services is an important revenue-generating department for hospitals, and each perioperative service line requires a tailored approach to be successful in managing outcomes and controlling costs. Perioperative leaders need to prepare to use data analytics to reduce variation in supplies, labor, andoverhead. Mercy, based in Chesterfield, Missouri, adopted a perioperative dashboard that helped perioperative leaders collaborate with surgeons and perioperative staff members to organize andanalyze health care data, which ultimately resulted in significant cost savings.

AB In the current clinical setting, many disease management options are available for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. For metastatic prostate cancer, first-line therapies almost always involve agents designed to inhibit androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs) that arise following first-line androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) may continue to respond to additional lines of AR-targeting therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide), chemotherapies (docetaxel and cabazitaxel), bone-targeting Radium-223 therapy, and immunotherapy sipuleucel-T. The rapidly expanding therapies for CRPC is expected to transform this lethal disease into one that can be managed for prolonged period of time. In the past 3 years, a number of promising biomarkers that may help to guide treatment decisions have been proposed and evaluated, including androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), a truncated AR lacking the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and mediate constitutively-active AR signaling. Putative treatment selection markers such as AR-V7 may further improve survival benefit of existing therapies and help to accelerate development of new agents for metastatic prostate cancer. In the metastatic setting, it is important to consider compatibility between the putative biomarker with non-invasive sampling. In this review, biomarkers relevant to the setting of metastatic prostate cancer are discussed with respect to a number of key attributes critical for clinical development of non-invasive, actionable markers. It is envisioned that biomarkers for metastatic prostate cancer will continue to be discovered, developed, and refined to meet the unmet needs in both standard-of-care and clinical trial settings.

AB This study's purpose was twofold: first, to examine the relative importance of job demands and resources as predictors of burnout and engagement, and second, the relative importance of engagement and burnout related to health, depressive symptoms, work ability, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions in two samples of health care workers. Nurse leaders ( n = 162) and licensed emergency medical technicians (EMTs; n = 102) completed surveys. In both samples, job demands predicted burnout more strongly than job resources, and job resources predicted engagement more strongly than job demands. Engagement held more weight than burnout for predicting commitment, and burnout held more weight for predicting health outcomes, depressive symptoms, and work ability. Results have implications for the design, evaluation, and effectiveness of workplace interventions to reduce burnout and improve engagement among health care workers. Actionable recommendations for increasing engagement and decreasing burnout in health care organizations are provided.

AB Pituitary adenomas are the commonest intracranial tumor, but metastases are rare (0.2% yearly incidence) and portend poor prognosis. CAPecitabine and TEMozolomide improved outcomes for neuroendocrine tumors. However, no chemotherapy is approved for refractory pituitary carcinomas. Next-generation sequencing revealed an actionable mTOR pathway STK11 mutation in a woman with adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary carcinoma refractory to six resections, radiation and CAPecitabine and TEMozolomide. Given efficacy in preclinical pancreatic cancer models with STK11 mutations, she received radiation and everolimus leading to clinical improvement and stability on MRI and PET for >6 months. She ultimately expired from widely metastatic disease. Next-generation sequencing can identify actionable mutations in rare or treatment refractory tumors. Earlier targeted therapy may improve outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to analyze triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) using an expanded next generation sequencing (NGS) assay, assess the clinical relevance using a recently described database, and correlate tumor morphology with detected genetic alterations.; METHODS: DNA was isolated from twenty primary TNBCs and genes of interest were enriched and sequenced with hybrid capture, followed by variant detection and functional and clinical annotation. The JAX-CTP assay detects actionable variants in the form of single nucleotide variations, small insertions and deletions (≤50bp), and copy number variants in 358 genes in specimens containing a neoplastic cell content of ≥50%. The JAX-CKB is a comprehensive database that curates tumor phenotype, genetic variant and protein effect, therapeutic relevance, and available treatment options.; RESULTS: 18/20 (90%) of TNBCs contained at least one somatic mutation detected by the JAX-CTP. MYC amplification was the most common alteration, present in 75% of tumors. TP53, AURKA, and KDR mutations were each present in 30% (6/20) of cases. Related recruiting clinical trials, extracted from JAX-CKB, included 166 for breast cancer, of which 17 were specific to only the TNBC subtype. All 17 trials were testing at least one therapy that targets a mutation identified in this sample set. The majority (89%) of tumors with basal-like histologic features had MYC amplification.; CONCLUSIONS: The expanded gene panel identified a variety of clinically actionable gene alterations in TNBCs. The identification of such variants increases the possibility for new therapeutic interventions and clinical trial eligibility for TNBC patients. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: For the histopathological diagnosis of lymphoma, lymph node excision biopsies are regarded as standard of care. In contrast, for the diagnosis of carcinoma and deep-seated tumors, core needle biopsies (CNBs) are accepted as a sufficient sampling method. We evaluated a diagnostic algorithm for peripheral lymphadenopathy starting with ultrasound-guided CNB followed by excisional biopsy in ambiguous cases.; METHODS: We performed ultrasound-guided CNB of peripheral lymph nodes and subcutaneous tumors in patients with lymphadenopathy in routine care and analyzed its accuracy, complication rate, and the impact of needle sizes on results.; RESULTS: From 138 patients, 132 samples were technically adequate. In 121 patients, CNB provided a clinically actionable diagnosis (76 lymphoma, 30 carcinoma, 15 non-malignant diagnoses). A total of 54 patients had a secondary biopsy. Inconclusive diagnoses were rare with two false-positive and two false-negative non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and higher for Hodgkin's lymphoma with five false-negative cases. The rate of complications was low. Needle size did not significantly influence results.; CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided CNBs are a safe, quick, and valid tool for the workup of lymphadenopathy. Yet, a benign diagnosis from CNB must be completed by a secondary biopsy if clinical presentation suggests malignant disease. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The goal of this work was to provide a community-academic partnership with actionable information for physical activity (PA) for a rural health-disparate region. Identified PA outlets were audited and combined with survey data for 813 residents in the region. Less than a third of sampled residents (28%) met PA recommendations, with low perceptions of safety for PA. PA resource outlets in rural areas had higher numbers of incivilities. On the basis of our findings, 4 actionable strategies are recommended: shared-use agreements, reducing incivilities, addressing issues related to safety from traffic, and increasing the number of PA resources in rural areas.

AB BACKGROUND: Survival for many individuals with paralysis is increasing, making this population a larger subset of the aging population (Molton, & Jensen, 2010). Yet little is known about the demographics and health of this population (Freedman, 2014).; OBJECTIVE: This study is one of the first evaluations of the differences in etiology, sociodemographic and health characteristics (i.e., health status, chronic, and secondary and medical conditions) of adults aging with versus into disability.; METHODS: A cross sectional epidemiological study was performed using secondary data from a nationally representative sample of adults with paralysis. The National Paralysis Survey is a random digit-dial survey of over 70,000 households. Weighted descriptive and regression analyses were conducted.; RESULTS: Eighty percent of those aging with paralysis had disabilities for 40+years. They showed significantly better self-reported health status, and a trend for more secondary and medical conditions. Those aging into paralysis had more chronic diseases.; CONCLUSIONS: Differences are evident between those aging with vs. into paralysis. These findings suggest that differentiating subgroups of older adults with disabilities by onset of disability makes disability and health information more actionable for programs and policies. Additional studies to explore the intersection of aging and disability onset across adulthood could increase our understanding of the dynamics of aging in persons with early and later onset disabilities.

AB Although family history is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) a genetic diagnosis cannot be obtained in over 50% of familial cases when screened for known CRC cancer susceptibility genes. The genetics of undefined-familial CRC is complex and recent studies have implied additional clinically actionable mutations for CRCin susceptibility genes for other cancers. To clarify the contribution of non-CRC susceptibility genes to undefined-familial CRC we conducted a mutational screen of 114 cancer susceptibility genes in 847 patients with early-onset undefined-familial CRC and 1609 controls by analysing high-coverage exome sequencing data. We implemented American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines for assigning pathogenicity to variants. Globally across all 114 cancer susceptibility genes no statistically significant enrichment of likely pathogenic variants was shown (6.7% cases 57/847, 5.3% controls 85/1609; P=0.15). Moreover there was no significant enrichment of mutations in genes such as TP53 or BRCA2 which have been proposed for clinical testing in CRC. In conclusion, while we identified genes that may be considered interesting candidates as determinants of CRC risk warranting further research, there is currently scant evidence to support a role for genes other than those responsible for established CRC syndromes in the clinical management of familial CRC.

AB Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring sensitive epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations invariably develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Identification of actionable genetic alterations conferring drug-resistance can be helpful for guiding the subsequent treatment decision. One of the major resistant mechanisms is secondary EGFR-T790M mutation. Other mechanisms, such as HER2 and MET amplifications, and PIK3CA mutations, were also reported. However, the mechanisms in the remaining patients are still unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling in a cohort of 83 NSCLC patients with TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations at diagnosis and acquired resistance to three different first-generation EGFR TKIs using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of 416 cancer-related genes. In total, we identified 322 genetic alterations with a median of 3 mutations per patient. 61% of patients still exhibit TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations, and 36% of patients acquired EGFR-T790M. Besides other known resistance mechanisms, we identified TET2 mutations in 12% of patients. Interestingly, we also observed SOX2 amplification in EGFR-T790M negative patients, which are restricted to Icotinib treatment resistance, a drug widely used in Chinese NSCLC patients. Our study uncovered mutational profiles of NSCLC patients with first-generation EGFR TKIs resistance with potential therapeutic implications.

AB PURPOSE: Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is an aggressive salivary malignancy, which is resistant to chemotherapy and has high mortality rates. We investigated the molecular landscape of SDC, focusing on genetic alterations and gene expression profiles.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical analyses in 16 SDC tumors and examined selected alterations via targeted sequencing of 410 genes in a second cohort of 15 SDCs.; RESULTS: SDCs harbored a higher mutational burden than many other salivary carcinomas (1.7 mutations/Mb). The most frequent genetic alterations were mutations in TP53 (55%), HRAS (23%), PIK3CA (23%), and amplification of ERBB2 (35%). Most (74%) tumors had alterations in either MAPK (BRAF/HRAS/NF1) genes or ERBB2 Potentially targetable alterations based on supportive clinical evidence were present in 61% of tumors. Androgen receptor (AR) was overexpressed in 75%; several potential resistance mechanisms to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were identified, including the AR-V7 splice variant (present in 50%, often at low ratios compared with full-length AR) and FOXA1 mutations (10%). Consensus clustering and pathway analyses in transcriptome data revealed striking similarities between SDC and molecular apocrine breast cancer.; CONCLUSIONS: This study illuminates the landscape of genetic alterations and gene expression programs in SDC, identifying numerous molecular targets and potential determinants of response to AR antagonism. This has relevance for emerging clinical studies of ADT and other targeted therapies in SDC. The similarities between SDC and apocrine breast cancer indicate that clinical data in breast cancer may generate useful hypotheses for SDC.

AB The rise of technologies that simultaneously measure thousands of data points represents the heart of systems biology. These technologies have had a huge impact on the discovery of next-generation diagnostics, biomarkers, and drugs in the precision medicine era. Systems biology aims to achieve systemic exploration of complex interactions in biological systems. Driven by high-throughput omics technologies and the computational surge, it enables multi-scale and insightful overviews of cells, organisms, and populations. Precision medicine capitalizes on these conceptual and technological advancements and stands on two main pillars: data generation and data modeling. High-throughput omics technologies allow the retrieval of comprehensive and holistic biological information, whereas computational capabilities enable high-dimensional data modeling and, therefore, accessible and user-friendly visualization. Furthermore, bioinformatics has enabled comprehensive multi-omics and clinical data integration for insightful interpretation. Despite their promise, the translation of these technologies into clinically actionable tools has been slow. In this review, we present state-of-the-art multi-omics data analysis strategies in a clinical context. The challenges of omics-based biomarker translation are discussed. Perspectives regarding the use of multi-omics approaches for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are presented by introducing a new paradigm shift in addressing IEM investigations in the post-genomic era.

AB Mutations and epigenetic alterations are key events in transforming normal cells to cancer cells. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the B-cell, is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis especially for those patients who are resistant to the frontline drugs. There is a great need to describe the molecular basis and mechanism of drug resistance in MCL to develop new strategies for treatment. We reviewed frequent somatic mutations and mutations involving the B-cell pathways in MCL and discussed clinical trials that attempted to disrupt these gene pathways and/or epigenetic events. Recurrent gene mutations were discussed in the light of prognostic and therapeutic opportunity and also the challenges of targeting these lesions. Mutations in the ATM, CCND1, TP53, MLL2, TRAF2 and NOTCH1 were most frequently encountered in mantle cell lymphoma. Translational models should be built that would assess mutations longitudinally to identify important compensatory, pro-survival and anti-apoptic pathways and actionable genetic targets.

AB Lung cancer diagnostics have progressed greatly in the previous decade. Development of molecular testing to identify an increasing number of potentially clinically actionable genetic variants, using smaller samples obtained via minimally invasive techniques, is a huge challenge. Tumour heterogeneity and cancer evolution in response to therapy means that repeat biopsies or circulating biomarkers are likely to be increasingly useful to adapt treatment as resistance develops. We highlight some of the current challenges faced in clinical practice for molecular testing of EGFR, ALK, and new biomarkers such as PDL1. Implementation of next generation sequencing platforms for molecular diagnostics in non-small-cell lung cancer is increasingly common, allowing testing of multiple genetic variants from a single sample. The use of next generation sequencing to recruit for molecularly stratified clinical trials is discussed in the context of the UK Stratified Medicine Programme and The UK National Lung Matrix Trial.

AB BACKGROUND: Over the past decade in Nepal, a large number of studies have been carried in a variety of health areas; however whether evidence derived from these studies has been used to inform health policy has not been explored. This study aims to assess the utilization of recommendations from health research in health policy and plans, and to identify the factors that influence utilization of research findings by policy makers' in Nepal.; METHODS: Qualitative study incorporating literature review and semi-structured interviews was used. Research reports and health related policies were collected from governmental and non-governmental bodies. Documents were reviewed to identify the utilization of research-based recommendations in health policy and plan formulation. In-depth interviews were conducted with key policy makers and researchers to identify factors that hinder the utilization of research recommendations.; RESULTS: A total of 83 health related research reports were identified, of which 48 had recommendations. Four policies and three plans, from total 21 identified plans and policies, were found to have incorporated recommendations from research. Of the 48 studies that had recommendations, 35 were found to be used in the policy making process. Lack of appropriate communication mechanisms, and concerns related to the quality of research conducted, were the main factors hindering the translation of evidence into policy.; CONCLUSIONS: Communication gaps exist between researchers and policy makers, which seem to have impeded the utilization of research-based information and recommendations in decision-making process. Establishing a unit responsible for synthesizing evidences and producing actionable messages for policy makers can improve utilization of research findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Incisional hernia (IH) is a persistent cause of morbidity and diminished quality of life and a substantial source of healthcare resource utilization. The literature suggests prophylactic mesh augmentation reduces IH risk in bariatric surgery, but no predictive models are available.; OBJECTIVES: Identify factors associated with IH after bariatric surgery to develop a clinically actionable preoperative risk stratification tool to optimize outcomes and mitigate healthcare costs after bariatric surgery.; SETTING: University hospital, United States.; METHODS: All patients undergoing open or laparoscopic bariatric surgery from January 2005 to June 2013 at one institution were identified. Co-morbidities and operative characteristics were assessed. The primary outcome was surgically treated IH after index procedures. Patients with prior hernia,<1-year follow-up, or body mass index<40 kg/m2 were excluded. Cox hazard regression modeling with bootstrapped validation, risk factor stratification, and assessment of model performance were conducted.; RESULTS: A total of 2161 bariatric patients were included, 2.4% of whom developed IH (follow-up 28.3±25.4 mo). Predictors for IH included open surgical approach (hazard ratio [HR] = 10.3), malnutrition (HR = 3.10), prior abdominal surgery (HR = 2.89), and body mass index>60 kg/m2 (HR = 2.60). Based on these risk factors, patients were stratified into low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories for IH development. Of the high-risk patients, 15.2% developed IH compared with .6% of low-risk patients (C-statistic = .85). Treatment of IH and associated complications exceeded $3.5 million in healthcare costs.; CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery conferred an IH risk of 2.4%. IH was associated with additional readmissions and complications and substantially greater costs and resource utilization. This risk stratification tool identifies candidates for prophylactic mesh augmentation, which may optimize outcomes while mitigating costs. Copyright A© 2016 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

AB Explorations of complex microbiomes using genomics greatly enhance our understanding about their diversity, biogeography, and function. The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare in a stepwise approach a total of eight commercially available DNA extraction kits and 16 procedures based on these for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, and hospital sewage). We assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls and different types of beads for bead beating, facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate than that in standard protocols. Based on this insight, we designed an improved DNA isolation procedure optimized for microbiome genomics that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens. A standard operating procedure is available from https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3475406. IMPORTANCE Sequencing-based analyses of microbiomes may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the microbial worlds associated with humans, animals, and the environment. Such insight could further the development of innovative ecosystem management approaches for the protection of our natural resources and the design of more effective and sustainable solutions to prevent and control infectious diseases. Genome sequence information is an organism (pathogen)-independent language that can be used across sectors, space, and time. Harmonized standards, protocols, and workflows for sample processing and analysis can facilitate the generation of such actionable information. In this study, we assessed several procedures for the isolation of DNA for next-generation sequencing. Our study highlights several important aspects to consider in the design and conduct of sequence-based analysis of microbiomes. We provide a standard operating procedure for the isolation of DNA from a range of biological specimens particularly relevant in clinical diagnostics and epidemiology.

AB Decades of basic and translational studies have identified the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells use molecular pathways to hijack the normal homeostasis of the pancreas, promoting pancreatic cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, as well as drug resistance. These molecular pathways were explored to develop targeted therapies to prevent or cure this fatal disease. Regrettably, the studies found that majority of the molecular events that dictate carcinogenic growth in the pancreas are non-actionable (potential non-responder groups of targeted therapy). In this review we discuss exciting discoveries on CCN-siblings that reveal how CCN-family members contribute to the different aspects of the development of pancreatic cancer with special emphasis on therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Radiological examinations require prior preparation that patients should be informed about. Radiologists and radiologic technologists have limited time and resources to do so. Therefore, the internet is a valuable and accessible resource for patient education, but the information may not be reliable, especially that in Arabic language. This study aimed to develop online patient education resources about imaging procedures in Arabic. It also evaluated the understandability and actionability of the source materials.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the University of Sharjah between October 2014 and July 2015. A website containing texts and audiovisuals for 21 medical imaging procedures was created. Bilingual (Arabic and English) radiology experts evaluated the materials with automatic score calculation using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. Two procedures were pilot tested by one evaluator, followed by completion of 28 evaluations by 15 selected experts.; RESULTS: Nineteen of 21 procedures were randomly evaluated. For printable materials, the mean understandability score was 92.37 (SD=8.355) and actionability score was 92.11 (SD=13.157). For audiovisual materials, the mean understandability score was 97.63 (SD=13.157) and the percentage for all actionability scores was 100%. The minimum acceptable percentage is 70%.; CONCLUSION: The high percentages scored for the online materials indicate that the evaluators were satisfied with the materials included and that the information would be easy for patients to understand and follow. The higher scores for the audiovisual materials indicate that they were considered more effective for improving patient knowledge patient knowledge.

AB OBJECTIVES: To develop a methodological approach for selecting, validating, and prioritizing attributes for health care decision making.; METHODS: Participants (n = 48) were recruited from community support groups if they had a child aged 26 years or younger diagnosed with a coexisting mental health condition and cognitive impairment. Six in-depth interviews eliciting care management experiences were transcribed and coded into themes following the principles of grounded theory and the constant comparative method. Six focus groups involving 42 participants assessed the relevance, priority, and meaning and inter-relationship among the themes. The positive predictive value and sensitivity assessed agreement on thematic meaning. A final list was selected from the top priorities with good agreement as candidate attributes. Attribute levels reflecting the range of experiences in care management decisions emerged from the verbatim passages within each coded theme.; RESULTS: Participants were the child's mother (73%), white (77%), married (69%), and on average 48 years old. The children were on average 14 years old; 44% had an intellectual disability, 25% had autism, and more than half had anxiety or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. All 14 attributes identified from the in-depth interviews were deemed relevant. The positive predictive value exceeded 90%, and the sensitivity ranged from 64% to 89%. The final set of attributes formed the framework for care management decisions consisting of six attributes (medication, behavior, services, social, treatment effects, and school) each with three levels.; CONCLUSIONS: A systematic approach grounded in qualitative methods produced a framework of relevant, important, and actionable attributes representing competing alternatives in clinical decisions.

AB While current S7B/E14 guidelines have succeeded in protecting patients from QT-prolonging drugs, the absence of a predictive paradigm identifying pro-arrhythmic risks has limited the development of valuable drug programs. We investigated if a human ex-vivo action potential (AP)-based model could provide a more predictive approach for assessing pro-arrhythmic risk in man. Human ventricular trabeculae from ethically consented organ donors were used to evaluate the effects of dofetilide, d,l-sotalol, quinidine, paracetamol and verapamil on AP duration (APD) and recognized pro-arrhythmia predictors (short-term variability of APD at 90% repolarization (STV(APD90)), triangulation (ADP90-APD30) and incidence of early afterdepolarizations at 1 and 2Hz to quantitatively identify the pro-arrhythmic risk. Each drug was blinded and tested separately with 3 concentrations in triplicate trabeculae from 5 hearts, with one vehicle time control per heart. Electrophysiological stability of the model was not affected by sequential applications of vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide). Paracetamol and verapamil did not significantly alter anyone of the AP parameters and were classified as devoid of pro-arrhythmic risk. Dofetilide, d,l-sotalol and quinidine exhibited an increase in the manifestation of pro-arrhythmia markers. The model provided quantitative and actionable activity flags and the relatively low total variability in tissue response allowed for the identification of pro-arrhythmic signals. Power analysis indicated that a total of 6 trabeculae derived from 2 hearts are sufficient to identify drug-induced pro-arrhythmia. Thus, the human ex-vivo AP-based model provides an integrative translational assay assisting in shaping clinical development plans that could be used in conjunction with the new CiPA-proposed approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely applied in clinical research, while its application in routine clinical molecular testing requires careful validation. The aim of our study was to assess the clinical usefulness of the NextDaySeq Lung panel on Ion Torrent PGM in mutation detection of actionable genes in lung cancer.; METHODS: The NextDaySeq assay was evaluated by blinded comparisons to Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) assays with 188 consecutive samples from Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to detect mutations in EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF. Discordant variants were further validated by Sanger sequencing and independent qPCR and NGS assays.; RESULTS: Our results showed 93.3% concordance of reportable variants mutually covered in both NGS and qPCR assays, with a clinical sensitivity of 89.9%, specificity of 97.5%. Through the comparison, the NGS assays demonstrated its advantages in offering more clinical relevant information, such as detecting non-hotspot mutations and providing mutation allele frequencies (MAF) and accurate mutation sequences. The analytical sensitivity of NGS to detect mutations with low MAF needs further improvement.; CONCLUSIONS: The NextDaySeq Lung panel exhibited good clinical performance, strongly supporting the implementation of the NGS assay in routine clinical use to facilitate therapeutic decision-making for lung cancer patients.

AB PURPOSE: Despite advances in the care of patients with severe burn injury, infection-related morbidity and mortality remain high and can potentially be reduced with antimicrobial dosing optimized for the infecting pathogen. However, anti-infective dose selection is difficult because of the highly abnormal physiologic features of burn patients, which can greatly affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of these agents. We review published PK data from burn patients and offer evidence-based dosing recommendations for antimicrobial agents in burn-injured patients.; METHODS: Because most infections occur at least 48 hours after initial burn injury and anti-infective therapy often lasts ≥10 days, we reviewed published data informing PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) dosing of anti-infectives administered during the second, hypermetabolic stage of burn injury, in those with >20% total body surface area burns, and in those with normal or augmented renal clearance (estimated creatinine clearance ≥130 mL/min). Analyses were performed using 10,000-patient Monte Carlo simulations, which uses PK variability observed in burn patients and MIC data to determine the probability of reaching predefined PK-PD targets. The probability of target attainment, defined as the likelihood that an anti-infective dosing regimen would achieve a specific PK-PD target at the single highest susceptible MIC, and the cumulative fraction of response, defined as the population probability of target attainment given a specific dose and a distribution of MICs, were calculated for each recommended anti-infective dosing regimen.; FINDINGS: Evidence-based doses were derived for burn-injured patients for 15 antibiotics and 2 antifungal agents. Published data were unavailable or insufficient for several agents important to the care of burn patients, including newer antifungal and antipseudomonal agents. Furthermore, available data suggest that antimicrobial PK properties in burned patients is highly variable. We recommend that, where possible, therapeutic drug monitoring be performed to optimize PK-PD parameter achievement in individual patients.; IMPLICATIONS: Given the high variability in PK disposition observed in burn patients, doses recommended in the package insert may not achieve PK-PD parameters associated with optimal infectious outcomes. Our study is limited by the necessity for fixed assumptions in depicting this highly variable patient population. New rapid-turnaround analytical technology is needed to expand the menu of antimicrobial agents for which therapeutic drug monitoring is available to guide dose modification within a clinically actionable time frame.

AB Major driver mutations of pulmonary adenocarcinomas have been identified and highlighted as actionable targets for precision cancer medicine. As phenotype is largely determined by genotype, genetic changes associated with morphologic features have recently received more attention from both pathologists and clinicians. The morphologic features of adenocarcinomas with mutations in EGFR or KRAS, or translocated ALK, have rarely been described. Pulmonary adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations, the most common driver mutation encountered in Asian patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, show lepidic or papillary organotypic growth patterns. KRAS-mutated adenocarcinomas demonstrate nonorganotypic growth patterns, especially mucin-containing cells. P53 mutations are associated with aggressiveness rather than growth patterns. HER2 mutations are observed in mucinous adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma with micropapillary features. The histologic features of BRAF-mutated adenocarcinomas have not yet been established, but papillary, lepidic, solid, and acinar patterns have been observed. Adenocarcinomas with rearrangement of ALK, ROS1, and RET genes share similar histologic features, such as solid signet-ring cells and cribriform formation. However, adenocarcinomas with NRG1 rearrangements frequently show mucinous morphology.

AB Thanks to highly specific analyte detection and potentially complete compensation for matrix variables based on the principle of stable isotope derivative internal standardisation, mass spectrometry methods allow the development of diagnostic tests of outstanding analytical quality. However, these features per se do not guarantee reliability of tests. A wide range of factors can introduce analytical errors and inaccuracy due to the extreme complexity of the methods involved. Furthermore, it can be expected that the application patterns of MS methods in diagnostic laboratories will change substantially during the coming years - with presumably less specialised laboratories implementing mass spectrometry. Introduction of highly automated test solutions by manufacturers will require some trade-off between operation convenience, sample throughput and analytical performance. Structured and careful quality and risk management is therefore crucial to translate the analytical power of mass spectrometry into actionable and reliable results for individual patients' care and to maintain the degree of reliability that is expected from MS methods in clinical pathology. This reflection review discusses whether particular quality assurance tools have to be applied for MS-based diagnostic tests and whether these tools are different from those applied for optical- and affinity-based standard tests. Both pre-implementation strategies and surveillance of assays with assessment of metadata in routine testing are addressed. The release of the CLSI guideline C62-A in 2014 was a substantial achievement in this context because it addresses a wide spectrum of relevant issues in quality assurance of mass spectrometry-based clinical tests. However, the translation of this best practice document into individual laboratory settings is likely to be heterogeneous.  Copyright © 2016 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

AB Esophageal cancer remains a highly lethal malignancy in which relatively modest therapeutic advances have been made over the past several decades. Cytotoxic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment for both advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with incremental benefit conferred by antibodies targeting HER2 and VEGFR in selected patients. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance in this disease almost invariably occurs and remains a major challenge. Moreover, although large-scale exome and whole-genome sequencing efforts have identified a variety of somatic mutations and copy number variations, particularly amplifications, in esophageal cancer, the ability to translate these findings successfully into actionable therapeutic approaches has been elusive. More recently, immunotherapeutic strategies, most notably immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated benefit to a subset of patients with both esophageal adenocarcinoma and SCC and represent an area of active clinical investigation. In this article, we discuss some of the insights derived from past trials of esophageal cancer, highlight ongoing research efforts in this arena, and emphasize the need to refine our approach to treating patients based on distinct anatomic, histologic, and molecular features.

AB Mitchell-Riley syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the RFX6 gene, is defined as a combination of neonatal diabetes mellitus and serious congenital gastrointestinal defects. We describe Mitchell-Riley syndrome in two sisters with two novel compound heterozygous variants in the RFX6 gene: c.1154G>A, p.(Arg385Gln), and c.1316_1319delTCTA, p.(Ile439Thrfs*13). Both sisters present milder forms of the syndrome, likely due to possible residual activity of the p.Arg385Gln variant, which is localized in a dimerization domain of the RFX6 transcription factor. We propose that the prognosis is dependent on patient RFX6 genotype and possible residual activity of RFX6 transcription factor. Both sisters had atypical later onset of diabetes, at 2 years and 10 months and 2 years and 7 months, respectively. This supports the need of extending the definition of diabetes in Mitchell-Riley syndrome from neonatal to childhood onset and regular glyceamia check in patients with gastrointestinal tract malformations typical for Mitchell-Riley syndrome. The clinical course in both sisters improved significantly after surgical removal of parts of the small intestine with heterotopic gastric mucosa. We suggest that gastric mucosa heterotopy is an important actionable part of Mitchell-Riley syndrome and could have been responsible for the malabsorption, failure to thrive and severe anemia present in previously reported patients with Mitchell-Riley syndrome.

AB AIMS: The incidence of RAS/RAF/PI3KA and TP53 gene mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC) is well established. Less information, however, is available on other components of the CRC genomic landscape, which are potential CRC prognostic/predictive markers.; METHODS: Following a previous validation study, ion-semiconductor next-generation sequencing (NGS) was employed to process 653 routine CRC samples by a multiplex PCR targeting 91 hotspot regions in 22 CRC significant genes.; RESULTS: A total of 796 somatic mutations in 499 (76.4%) tumours were detected. Besides RAS/RAF/PI3KA and TP53, other 12 genes showed at least one mutation including FBXW7 (6%), PTEN (2.8%), SMAD4 (2.1%), EGFR (1.2%), CTNNB1 (1.1%), AKT1 (0.9%), STK11 (0.8%), ERBB2 (0.6%), ERBB4 (0.6%), ALK (0.2%), MAP2K1 (0.2%) and NOTCH1 (0.2%).; CONCLUSIONS: In a routine diagnostic setting, NGS had the potential to generate robust and comprehensive genetic information also including less frequently mutated genes potentially relevant for prognostic assessments or for actionable treatments.

AB BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to examine the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (ACSNSQIP-P) Participant Use File (PUF) to compare risk-adjusted outcomes of neonates versus other pediatric surgical patients.; METHODS: In the ACS-NSQIP-P 2012-2013 PUF, patients were classified as preterm neonate, term neonate, or nonneonate at the time of surgery. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and composite morbidity. Patient characteristics significantly associated with the primary outcomes were used to build a multivariate logistic regression model.; RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality rate for preterm neonates, term neonate, and nonneonates was 4.9%, 2.0%, 0.1%, respectively (p<0.0001). The overall 30-day morbidity rate for preterm neonates, term neonates, and nonneonates was 27.0%, 17.4%, 6.4%, respectively (p<0.0001). After adjustment for preoperative and operative risk factors, both preterm (adjusted odds ratio, 95% CI: 2.0, 1.4-3.0) and term neonates (aOR, 95% CI: 1.9, 1.2-3.1) had a significantly increased odds of 30-day mortality compared to nonneonates.; CONCLUSION: Surgical neonates are a cohort who are particularity susceptible to postoperative morbidity and mortality after adjusting for preoperative and operative risk factors. Collaborative efforts focusing on surgical neonates are needed to understand the unique characteristics of this cohort and identify the areas where the morbidity and mortality can be improved.

AB BACKGROUND: Injury and violence-related morbidity and mortality present a major public health problem in North Carolina. However, the extent to which local health departments (LHDs) engage in injury and violence prevention (IVP) has not been well described.; OBJECTIVES: One objective of the current study is to provide a baseline assessment of IVP in the state's LHDs, describing capacity, priorities, challenges, and the degree to which programs are data-driven and evidence-based. The study will also describe a replicable, cost-effective method for systematic assessment of regional IVP.; DESIGN: This is an observational, cross-sectional study that was conducted through a survey of North Carolina's 85 LHDs.; RESULTS: Representatives from 77 LHDs (91%) responded. Nearly one-third (n = 23; 30%) reported that no staff members were familiar with evidence-based interventions in IVP, and over one-third (n = 29; 38%) reported that their LHD did not train staff in IVP. Almost one-half (n = 37; 48%) had no dedicated funding for IVP. On average, respondents said that about half of their programs were evidence-based; however, there was marked variation (mean, 52%; standard deviation = 41). Many collaborated with diverse partners including law enforcement, hospitals, and community-based organizations. There was discordance between injury and violence burden and programming. Overall, 53% of issues listed as top local problems were not targeted in their LHDs' programs.; CONCLUSIONS: Despite funding constraints, North Carolina's LHDs engaged in a broad range of IVP activities. However, programming did not uniformly address state injury and violence priorities, nor local injury and violence burden. Staff members need training in evidence-based strategies that target priority areas. Multisector partnerships were common and increased LHDs' capacity. These findings are actionable at the state and local level. ©2016 by the North Carolina Institute of Medicine and The Duke Endowment. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The traditional treatment for lacrimal gland carcinoma is orbital exenteration followed by radiation therapy. However, orbital exenteration does not prevent distant relapse and death, and some patients experience local-regional recurrence after exenteration. More recently, eye-sparing surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy have gained popularity in the treatment of lacrimal gland carcinoma. Preliminary studies show that these approaches are associated with reasonable local control rates and ocular toxicity profiles. In this review, we discuss recent studies of treatment of lacrimal gland carcinoma, including studies of potential molecular treatment targets.; RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies suggest promising results for neoadjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy followed by orbital exenteration and adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy, but only in patients with an 'intact lacrimal artery'. Recent studies of globe-sparing surgery followed by adjuvant proton radiation therapy or concurrent chemoradiation suggest good local control, reasonable rates of eye preservation, and low risk of serious ocular toxic effects. Larger tumor size and predominant basaloid histology seem to be associated with higher risk of local-regional recurrence and distant metastasis. One study showed oncogenic mutations in more than half of cases of lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, with KRAS mutations in 10 of 24 patients, suggesting potential benefit of treatments targeting the EGFR-RAS-RAF cascade.; SUMMARY: In selected patients with lacrimal gland carcinoma, eye-sparing surgery with eye-sparing radiation therapy offers preservation of visual function with good local control and minimal radiation-induced ocular toxic effects. In patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, a search for actionable cancer-associated mutations may be prudent.

AB The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family. Oncogenic activation of mTOR signaling significantly contributes to the progression of different types of cancers including osteosarcoma (OS; the most common primary malignant tumor of bone). In the present study, we review the association of the mTOR signaling pathway with OS, and the possible effective treatment strategies by targeting this pathway. In the metastatic behavior of OS, one of the most common actionable aberrations was found in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Upon phosphorylation, activated mTOR contributes to OS cellular transformation and poor cancer prognosis via downstream effectors such as S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E, which are overexpressed in OS. Targeting the mTOR complex is a significant approach in cancer therapeutic research, and of course, rapamycin is the primary inhibitor of mTOR. Various other chemotherapeutic molecules have also shown potential activity against mTOR. As mTOR is a new promising oncological target and blockade of the mTOR pathway with selective inhibitors has significant potential in OS therapeutic research, the development of the optimal dose, regimen and a rationale for the use of mTOR inhibitors in combination with other anticancer agents may provide a successful treatment strategy for OS.

AB Combination therapies are essential to address the genetic complexity, plasticity, and heterogeneity of tumors and to overcome resistance mechanisms that confound single-agent approaches, and are a paradigm that became well established in the era of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies. Today, we are well equipped to address many of the scientific, clinical, and collaboration challenges that have existed historically; however, the pace of testing rational combinations is modest. Our analysis shows that the volume of clinical trials testing multiple investigational pipeline agents ("novel-novel" combinations) is dismally low, as out of approximately 1,500 phase I to III investigational combination trials initiated in 2014-2015, only 80 were for novel-novel combinations, and only 9 of those involved more than one company. The Collaborative Novel-Novel Combination Therapies (CoNNCT) initiative aims to alleviate this bottleneck by developing a new, faster paradigm for early investigation of scientifically informed, novel-novel drug combinations. The initiative kicked off on March 7, 2016, when representatives from top academic centers, biopharma, nonprofits, the FDA, and other groups gathered to define an actionable path forward.

AB PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic solid tumors who had progressed on at least one line of standard of care therapy were referred to the Indiana University Health Precision Genomics Program. Tumor samples were submitted for DNA & RNA next-generation sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry for actionable targets. A multi-disciplinary tumor board reviewed all results. For each patient, the ratio of progression-free survival (PFS) of the genomically guided line of therapy divided by the PFS of their prior line was calculated. Patients whose PFS ratio was ≥ 1.3 were deemed to have a meaningful improvement in PFS.; RESULTS: From April 2014-October 2015, 168 patients were evaluated and 101 patients achieved adequate clinical follow-up for analysis. 19 of 44 (43.2%) patients treated with genomically guided therapy attained a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 vs. 3 of 57 (5.3%) treated with non-genomically guided therapy (p < 0.0001). Similarly, overall PFS ratios (irrespective of cutoff) were higher for patients with genomically guided therapy vs non-genomically guided therapy (p = 0.05). Further, patients treated with genomically guided therapy had a superior median PFS compared to those treated with non-genomically guided therapy (86 days vs. 49 days, p = 0.005, H.R. = 0.55, 95% C.I.:0.37-0.84).; CONCLUSION: Patients with refractory metastatic cancer who receive genomically guided therapy have improved PFS ratios and longer median PFS compared to patients who do not receive genomically guided therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: As we have previously reported, small cell carcinoma of the ovary (SCCO) is a rare, aggressive form of ovarian cancer associated with poor outcomes. In an effort to identify new treatment options, we utilized comprehensive genomic profiling to assess the potential for novel therapies in SCCO.; METHODS: Patients with SCCO, SCCO-HT (hypercalcemic type), neuroendocrine tumors of the ovary (NET-O), and small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCLC) profiled by Caris Life Sciences between 2007-2015 were identified. Tumors were assessed with up to 21 IHC stains, in situ hybridization of cMET, EGFR, HER2 and PIK3CA, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as Sanger sequencing of selected genes.; RESULTS: Forty-six patients with SCCO (10 SCCO, 18 SCCO-HT, 18 NET-O) were identified as well as 58 patients with SCLC for comparison. Patients with SCCO and SCCO-HT were younger (median 42 years [range 12-75] and 26 years [range 8-40], respectively) than patients with NET-O 62 [range 13-76] or SCLC 66 [range 36-86]. SCCO patients were more likely to be metastatic (70 %) than SCCO-HT (50 %) or NET-O (33 %) patients, but at a similar rate to SCLC patients (65 %). PD1 expression varied across tumor type with SCCO (100 %), SCCO-HT (60 %), NET-O (33 %) vs SCLC (42 %). PDL1 expression also varied with SCCO (50 %), SCCO-HT (20 %), NET-O (33 %) and SCLC (0 %). No amplifications were identified in cMET, EGFR, or HER2 and only 1 was found in PIK3CA (NET-O). Actionable mutations were rare with 1 patient with SCCO having a BRCA2 mutation and 1 patient with NET-O having a PIK3CA mutation. No other actionable mutations were identified.; CONCLUSIONS: No recurrent actionable mutations or rearrangements were identified using this platform in SCCO. IHC patterns may help guide the use of chemotherapy in these rare tumors.

AB Pancreatic cancer is an extremely aggressive disease; although progress has been made in the last few years, the prognosis of these patients remains dismal. FOLFIRINOX is now considered a standard treatment in first-line setting, since it demonstrated an improved overall and progression-free survival vs gemcitabine alone. However, the enthusiasm over the benefit of this three-drug regimen is tempered by the associated increased toxicity profile, and many efforts have been made to improve the feasibility of this schedule. After a more recent phase III trial showing an improved outcome over gemcitabine, the combination of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel emerged as another standard first-line treatment. However, this treatment is also associated with more side effects. In addition, despite initial promising data on the predictive role of SPARC levels, recent studies showed that these levels are not associated with nab-paclitaxel efficacy. The choice to use this treatment over FOLFIRINOX is therefore a topic of debate, also because no validated biomarkers to guide FOLFIRINOX treatment are available. In the era of actionable mutations and target agents it would be desirable to identify molecular factors or biomarkers to predict response to therapy in order to maximize the efficacy of treatment and avoid useless toxic effects for non-responding patients. However, until today the milestone of treatment for pancreatic cancer remains chemotherapy combinations, without predictive or monitoring tools existing to optimize therapy. This review analyzes the state-of-the-art treatments, promises and limitations of targeted therapies, ongoing trials and future perspectives, including potential role of microRNAs as predictive biomarkers.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate germline variants in hereditary cancer susceptibility genes among unselected cancer patients undergoing tumor-germline sequencing.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Germline sequence data from 439 individuals undergoing tumor-germline dyad sequencing through the LCCC1108/UNCseq (NCT01457196) study were analyzed for genetic variants in 36 hereditary cancer susceptibility genes. These variants were analyzed as an exploratory research study to determine whether pathogenic variants exist within the germline of patients undergoing tumor-germline sequencing. Patients were unselected with respect to indicators of hereditary cancer predisposition.; RESULTS: Variants indicative of hereditary cancer predisposition were identified in 19 (4.3%) patients. For about half (10/19), these findings represent new diagnostic information with potentially important implications for the patient and their family. The others were previously identified through clinical genetic evaluation secondary to suspicion of a hereditary cancer predisposition. Genes with pathogenic variants included ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, and CHEK2 In contrast, a substantial proportion of patients (178, 40.5%) had Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), 24 of which had VUS in genes pertinent to the presenting cancer. Another 143 had VUS in other hereditary cancer genes, and 11 had VUS in both pertinent and nonpertinent genes.; CONCLUSIONS: Germline analysis in tumor-germline sequencing dyads will occasionally reveal significant germline findings that were clinically occult, which could be beneficial for patients and their families. However, given the low yield for unexpected germline variation and the large proportion of patients with VUS results, analysis and return of germline results should adhere to guidelines for secondary findings rather than diagnostic hereditary cancer testing.

AB Anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab has prolonged progression-free survival in several cancer types, however acquired resistance is common. Adaption has been observed pre-clinically, but no human study has shown timing and genes involved, enabling formulation of new clinical paradigms. In a window-of-opportunity study in 35 ductal breast cancer patients for 2weeks prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we monitored bevacizumab response by Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance [DCE-MRI], transcriptomic and pathology. Initial treatment response showed significant overall decrease in DCE-MRI median K(trans), angiogenic factors such ESM1 and FLT1, and proliferation. However, it also revealed great heterogeneity, spanning from downregulation of blood vessel density and central necrosis to continued growth with new vasculature. Crucially, significantly upregulated pathways leading to resistance included glycolysis and pH adaptation, PI3K-Akt and immune checkpoint signaling, for which inhibitors exist, making a strong case to investigate such combinations. These findings support that anti-angiogenesis trials should incorporate initial enrichment of patients with high K(trans), and a range of targeted therapeutic options to meet potential early resistance pathways. Multi-arm adaptive trials are ongoing using molecular markers for targeted agents, but our results suggest this needs to be further modified by much earlier adaptation when using drugs affecting the tumor microenvironment.

AB PURPOSE: The authors' institution provides 24/7 attending radiologist final interpretations for all emergency, urgent, and inpatient studies. As a supplement to the existing emergency radiology faculty, the institution relies on two groups of radiologists to provide final imaging interpretations after hours: radiology fellows (RFs) and newly hired subspecialty radiologists (NRs). For both groups, subspecialty services provide overreads the following day to improve the skills of the staff members and ensure clinical excellence. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical significance and rate of discrepancies between RFs and NRs.; METHODS: A retrospective review of all overreads from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2015, was performed. Discrepancy rates for RFs and NRs were calculated. Error significance for cases requiring addenda was categorized as follows: acute, likely malignant, indeterminate, unlikely to be of clinical significance, insignificant typographic error, or significant typographic error.; RESULTS: In total, 10,796 studies were rechecked, of which 1.9% (n= 205) required addenda, 3.6% (n= 384) were deemed addendum-optional, and 94.5% (n= 10,207) required no comments. There was no significant difference in cases requiring addenda (RFs,1.7% [119 of 6,847]; NRs, 2.2% [86 of 3,949]; P= .11). Of the 205 cases requiring addenda, 21.0% (n= 43) were deemed to be acute, 4.9% (n=10) likely malignant, 28.3% (n= 58) indeterminate, 32.7% (n= 67) unlikely to be of clinical significance, and 13.1% (n= 27) secondary to typographic errors (66.7% [n= 18] deemed to be significant).; CONCLUSIONS: After-hours coverage with RFs and NRs allows high-quality final, actionable interpretations with low discrepancy rates and no significant difference between both groups for addendum-needed cases. The program strikes a balance between the need for timely interpretations and the need to continually monitor and improve the quality of interpretations through subspecialist feedback.

AB CONTEXT: -Molecular diagnostics play a role in the management of many cancers, including breast cancer.; OBJECTIVE: -To provide an update on molecular testing in current clinical practice, targeted at practicing pathologists who are not breast cancer specialists.; DATA SOURCES: -This study is a narrative literature review.; CONCLUSIONS: -In addition to routine hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptor testing, new and recurrent tumors are tested for HER2 amplification by in situ hybridization or overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Intrinsic subtyping of tumors represents a fundamental advance in our understanding of breast cancer biology, but currently it has an indirect role in patient management. Clinical next-generation sequencing (tumor profiling) is increasingly used to identify potentially actionable mutations in tumor tissue. Multianalyte assays with algorithmic analysis, including MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, and Prosigna, play a larger role in breast cancer than in many other malignancies. Given that a proportion of breast cancers are familial, testing of nontumor tissue for cancer predisposition mutations also plays a role in breast cancer care.

AB Hamartomatous polyps (HPs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are rare compared to other types of GI polyps, yet they are the most common type of polyp in children. The symptoms are usually rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, obstipation, anaemia, and/or small bowel obstruction. The polyps are typically removed concurrently with endoscopy when located in the colon, rectum, or stomach, whereas polyps in the small bowel are removed during push-enteroscopy, device-assisted enteroscopy, or by surgery. HPs can be classified as juvenile polyps or Peutz-Jeghers polyps based on their histopathological appearance. Patients with one or a few juvenile polyps are usually not offered clinical follow-up as the polyp(s) are considered not to harbour any malignant potential. Nevertheless, it is important to note that juvenile polyps and HPs are also found in patients with hereditary hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (HPS). Patients with HPS have an increased risk of cancer, recurrences of polyps, and extraintestinal complications. The syndromes are important to diagnose, as patients should be offered surveillance from childhood or early adolescence. The syndromes include juvenile polyposis syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome. Currently, the HPS diagnoses are based on clinical criteria and are often assisted with genetic testing as candidate genes have been described for each syndrome. This thesis is based on six scientific papers. The overall aim of the studies was to expand the knowledge on clinical course and molecular genetics in patients with HPs and HPS, and to investigate research participants' attitude towards the results of extensive genetic testing.  Paper I: In the first paper we investigated the occurrence, anatomic distribution, and other demographics of juvenile polyps in the colon and rectum in Denmark in 1995-2014. Based on the Danish Pathology Data Bank we found that 1772 patients had 2108 JPs examined in the period, and we calculated the incidence of juvenile polyps to be between 1:45,000 and 1:65,000. The majority of patients with juvenile polyps were adults and 1% fulfilled to diagnostic criteria of JPS. The majority of patients had a single juvenile polyp. Paper II: In this paper we conducted a review of the HPS based on the current literature. Paper III: We investigated the hypothesis that patients with one or few HPs may have a HPS based on genetic screening. We de-signed a panel of 26 genes associated with HPS and used targeted next generation sequencing in 77 patients with mainly one juvenile polyp. We detected several germ line variants, among them three in ENG, two in BMPR1A, one in PTEN, and one in SMAD4. Although some of the detected variants have been reported previously none could be classified as definitely pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to our variant classification scheme and thus we concluded that genetic screening of patients with one or few JPs are not indicated. Paper IV: In Paper IV we investigated one of the ethical aspects of next generation sequencing: the issue whether research participants in NGS studies should be offered the possibility of not re-ceiving information on incidental genetic findings (the "opting out possibility"). We conducted semi-structures interviews in 127 research participants, and found that the majority (61%) wanted information on all incidentals findings, while 36% wanted information on actionable incidental findings. Only 3% did not want information on incidental findings at all. Paper V: In this paper we wanted to gather information on all Danish patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in order to investigate the phenotype and genotype. Through Danish registers we detected 43 patients of which 14 had deceased. We calculated the prevalence of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome to be approximately one in 195,000 individuals. The median age at diagnosis was 29 years with obstruction of the small bowel as the most frequent presenting symptom. We noted 18 cancer occurrences in the population in both the GI tract and at extraintestinal sites, demonstrating that these patients are predisposed to cancer at various anatomical sites. The study also underlined the wide phenotypic expression of the syndrome.  Paper VI: In the last paper we identified patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome, who carry a SMAD4 mutation, and described their genotype and phenotype. We especially investigated whether these patients have symptoms of both juvenile polyposis syndrome and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. We identified 14 Danish patients. Most of these had symptoms of both conditions and one had aortic root dilatation. Thus, this group of patients requires a multidisciplinary follow-up program.

AB BACKGROUND: In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter to state Medicaid directors explaining the need for oversight of psychiatric prescriptions for children with mental health disorders. The National Committee for Quality Alliance proposed 3 quality measures for rating managed care organizations (MCOs) that involve use of second-generation or atypical antipsychotics in children. In order to ensure appropriate use and to effectively manage the use of second-generation antipsychotics in children, MCOs need to better understand the factors that influence medication treatment decisions for children.; OBJECTIVES: To (a) determine how patient-level and physician-level factors influence decisions to prescribe second-generation antipsychotics to children (aged under 18 years) diagnosed with psychosis and (b) evaluate how the influence of these factors may differ between primary care providers and psychiatrists.; METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional survey of 193 primary care providers and psychiatrists. A web-based patient simulation survey using a fractional factorial design was administered via a commercial vendor. Respondents were presented with simulated patient profiles described by various levels of factors considered to be essential to decision making. Respondents were asked to make treatment recommendations for each profile evaluated. In addition to treatment recommendations, demographics and beliefs about products were measured. Modified Poisson regression accounting for multilevel data was used to identify the factors that significantly affect treatment recommendations.; RESULTS: Psychiatrists were more likely to recommend second-generation antipsychotics than primary care practitioners (unadjusted RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.23-1.51). Social factors such as foster status or parental concern were not found to be significant predictors of prescribing second-generation antipsychotics. The percentage of a provider's patients using second-generation antipsychotics (RR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.0002-1.003), patient age (aged 4 years: RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.68-0.84; aged 10 years: RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99; reference group: aged 15 years), and patient disease severity (severe: RR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.18; moderate: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05-1.17; reference group: mild) significantly predicted prescription behavior among primary care providers and psychiatrists. Primary care providers were about twice as likely to recommend antipsychotics if they believed the use of antipsychotics was a labeled indication (RR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.56-2.98) or a medically accepted use (RR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.33-2.67), when compared with physicians who believed there was no evidence available. This effect was not significant among psychiatrists. Primary care providers, but not psychiatrists, were also significantly influenced by patient white blood cell (WBC) count. Patients with healthy WBC counts were 1.11 times as likely (95% CI = 1.05-1.17) to receive antipsychotics from primary care providers compared with those with low WBC count. Patient body mass index (BMI) was not found to significantly influence prescribing behavior. Nearly 50% of patients did not receive recommendations for psychosocial care. Primary care providers recommended antipsychotic polypharmacy in 23% of the patient profiles, while psychiatrists did so in 42% of the profiles.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insight into physician-prescribing practices for antipsychotics. The lack of significance of foster status and parental concern, after controlling for other factors, shows that physicians base their decisions on clinical factors more than social factors. Results for patient BMI and frequency of recommendations of polypharmacy are concerning. The general lack of awareness of evidence supporting use of antipsychotics is also highly concerning. The effects of patient BMI, beliefs about evidence supporting use, and prescribing practices with regard to psychosocial care and antipsychotic polypharmacy provide actionable results for managed care programs looking to improve their quality metrics. The results of this study further demonstrate the need for the immediate implementation of the various proposed quality metrics in this area and for new practice guidelines to raise the current standard of care.; DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this research.

AB Active and passive mobile sensing has garnered much attention in recent years. In this paper, we focus on chronic pain measurement and management as a case application to exemplify the state of the art. We present a consolidated discussion on the leveraging of various sensing modalities along with modular server-side and on-device architectures required for this task. Modalities included are: activity monitoring from accelerometry and location sensing, audio analysis of speech, image processing for facial expressions as well as modern methods for effective patient self-reporting. We review examples that deliver actionable information to clinicians and patients while addressing privacy, usability, and computational constraints. We also discuss open challenges in the higher level inferencing of patient state and effective feedback with potential directions to address them. The methods and challenges presented here are also generalizable and relevant to a broad range of other applications in mobile sensing.

AB In the context of clinical oncology, a fundamental goal of radiomics is the extraction of large amounts of quantitative features whose subsequent analysis can be used for decision support towards personalized and actionable cancer care. Head and neck cancers present a unique set of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges by nature of its complex anatomy and heterogeneity. Radiomics holds the potential to address these barriers, but only if as a collective field we direct future effort towards investigating specific oncologic function and oncologic outcomes, with external validation and collaborative multi-institutional efforts to begin standardizing and refining radiomic signatures. Here we present an overview of radiomic texture analysis methods as well as the software infrastructure, review the developments of radiomics in head and neck cancer applications, discuss unmet challenges, and propose key recommendations for moving the field forward.

AB Prostate cancer exhibits intra-tumoral heterogeneity that we hypothesize to be the leading confounding factor contributing to the underperformance of the current pre-treatment clinical-pathological and genomic assessment. These limitations impose an urgent need to develop better computational tools to identify men with low risk of prostate cancer versus others that may be at risk for developing metastatic cancer. The patient stratification will directly translate to patient treatments, wherein decisions regarding active surveillance or intensified therapy are made. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) provides the platform to investigate tumor heterogeneity by mapping the individual tumor habitats. We hypothesize that quantitative assessment (radiomics) of these habitats results in distinct combinations of descriptors that reveal regions with different physiologies and phenotypes. Radiogenomics, a discipline connecting tumor morphology described by radiomic and its genome described by the genomic data, has the potential to derive "radio phenotypes" that both correlate to and complement existing validated genomic risk stratification biomarkers. In this article we first describe the radiomic pipeline, tailored for analysis of prostate mpMRI, and in the process we introduce our particular implementations of radiomics modules. We also summarize the efforts in the radiomics field related to prostate cancer diagnosis and assessment of aggressiveness. Finally, we describe our results from radiogenomic analysis, based on mpMRI-Ultrasound (MRI-US) biopsies and discuss the potential of future applications of this technique. The mpMRI radiomics data indicate that the platform would significantly improve the biopsy targeting of prostate habitats through better recognition of indolent versus aggressive disease, thereby facilitating a more personalized approach to prostate cancer management. The expectation to non-invasively identify habitats with high probability of housing aggressive cancers would result in directed biopsies that are more informative and actionable. Conversely, providing evidence for lack of disease would reduce the incidence of non-informative biopsies. In radiotherapy of prostate cancer, dose escalation has been shown to reduce biochemical failure. Dose escalation only to determinate prostate habitats has the potential to improve tumor control with less toxicity than when the entire prostate is dose escalated.

AB INTRODUCTION: Tumour molecular profiling has been at the crossroads of large-scale integrative genomic studies and major clinical trials over the past 5years and has provided roadmaps for better disease stratification and therapeutic management.; AREAS COVERED: We review the landscape of precision oncology trials in Asia, Europe and the United States, and emerging insights gained from recently reported studies such as the SHIVA and CUSTOM trials. Changes in the molecular portraits of human cancers and the immune contexture of the tumor microenvironment during treatment may predict the course of tumor progression, including the development of treatment resistance. 'Liquid biopsy' approaches that harness circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA and exosomes may provide a non-invasive means of monitoring the parent tumor in real-time. Several molecular signatures are being evaluated as biomarkers for emerging immunologic approaches, such as the mismatch-repair deficiency status and nonsynonymous mutation burden in anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, we review the current actionability and future clinical impact of multigene panel and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based profiling.; EXPERT OPINION: In the future, molecular profiling may help to fulfill unmet needs for predictive biomarkers in novel immunotherapeutic approaches, while ongoing precision trials are laying the foundations for clinical uptake of NGS testing.

AB INTRODUCTION: Topical, systemic, oral disease modifying, and biologic agents are part of the armamentarium to manage psoriatic disease. The choice of therapy depends upon disease severity, relevant co-morbidities and patient preference. There is great variability in patient response with these agents, and there is still no clear method of selecting the preferred therapeutic agent for efficacy or lack of adverse events.; AREAS COVERED: This article will review the pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic targets that are currently known with respect to psoriasis vulgaris, and the most frequent co-morbidity of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis.; EXPERT OPINION: Presently, no clinically actionable biomarker exists for any therapeutic agent used to treat psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. The lack of validated outcome measures and conflicting results of open-label studies conducted may be attributed to a multitude of issues that confound discovery. Consequently, studies have been underpowered to identify genes or genetic variants worth translating to clinical practice. In order to achieve a pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic signature, improvements in study design of future investigations are required, including carefully designed prospective studies. It is imperative to combine known clinical, serological, and molecular markers with consistent outcomes and an adequate health economic evaluation before they can be adopted widely in clinical practice.

AB PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of actionable findings on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans performed for the primary diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved single center, retrospective study of consecutive series of patients evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRA for PE. The final radiology report of each MRA was reviewed. All technically adequate negative exams were included in the analysis. The findings were divided into three types: those requiring further action (actionable-Type 1) those not requiring follow-up (non-actionable-Type 2) and normal exams. We compared our results with the literature regarding the use of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in this scenario using Fisher's exact test.; RESULTS: 580 MRA scans for PE were performed. There were 561/580 (97%) technically adequate exams. Of these, 514/580 (89%) were negative and 47/580 (8%) were positive for PE. In the PE negative group of 514 exams, Type 1 findings were identified in 85/514 (17%), 188/514 (36%) cases were Type 2 and 241/514 (47.0%) were Type 3. There was no significant difference between the incidence of Type 1 and the combination of Type 2 and Type 3 findings on MRA and the reported incidence of actionable findings derived from CTA negative exams for PE (p<0.5).; CONCLUSION: MRA as a first-line test for PE can identify actionable findings in those patients without PE, with an incidence similar to that reported in the literature for CTA.

AB Urothelial bladder cancers (UBCs) have heterogeneous clinical characteristics that are mirrored in their diverse genomic profiles. Genomic profiling of UBCs has the potential to benefit routine clinical practice by providing prognostic utility above and beyond conventional clinicopathological factors, and allowing for prediction and surveillance of treatment responses. Urinary DNAs representative of the tumour genome provide a promising resource as a liquid biopsy for non-invasive genomic profiling of UBCs. We compared the genomic profiles of urinary cellular DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the urine with matched diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour DNAs for 23 well-characterised UBC patients. Our data show urinary DNAs to be highly representative of patient tumours, allowing for detection of recurrent clinically actionable genomic aberrations. Furthermore, a greater aberrant load (indicative of tumour genome) was observed in cfDNA over cellular DNA (P<0.001), resulting in a higher analytical sensitivity for detection of clinically actionable genomic aberrations (P<0.04) when using cfDNA. Thus, cfDNA extracted from the urine of UBC patients has a higher tumour genome burden and allows greater detection of key genomic biomarkers (90%) than cellular DNA from urine (61%) and provides a promising resource for robust whole-genome tumour profiling of UBC with potential to influence clinical decisions without invasive patient interventions.

AB Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in women, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks clinically actionable therapeutic targets. Death in mitosis is a tumor suppressive mechanism that occurs in cancer cells experiencing a defective M phase. The orphan estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRbeta) is a key reprogramming factor in murine embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. In primates, ERRbeta is alternatively spliced to produce several receptor isoforms. In cellular models of glioblastoma, short form (ERRbetasf) and beta2 (ERRbeta2) splice variants differentially regulate cell cycle progression in response to the synthetic agonist DY131, with ERRbeta2 driving arrest in G2/M.The goals of the present study are to determine the cellular function(s) of ligand-activated ERRbeta splice variants in breast cancer and evaluate the potential of DY131 to serve as an antimitotic agent, particularly in TNBC. DY131 inhibits growth in a diverse panel of breast cancer cell lines, causing cell death that involves the p38 stress kinase pathway and a bimodal cell cycle arrest. ERRbeta2 facilitates the block in G2/M, and DY131 delays progression from prophase to anaphase. Finally, ERRbeta2 localizes to centrosomes and DY131 causes mitotic spindle defects. Targeting ERRbeta2 may therefore be a promising therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.

AB A systematic review relevant to the following research questions was conducted (1) the extent to which different theoretical frameworks have been applied to food risk/benefit communication and (2) the impact such food risk/benefit communication interventions have had on related risk/benefit attitudes and behaviors. Fifty four papers were identified. The analysis revealed that (primarily European or US) research interest has been relatively recent. Certain food issues were of greater interest to researchers than others, perhaps reflecting the occurrence of a crisis, or policy concern. Three broad themes relevant to the development of best practice in risk (benefit) communication were identified: the characteristics of the target population; the contents of the information; and the characteristics of the information sources. Within these themes, independent and dependent variables differed considerably. Overall, acute risk (benefit) communication will require advances in communication process whereas chronic communication needs to identify audience requirements. Both citizen's risk/benefit perceptions and (if relevant) related behaviors need to be taken into account, and recommendations for behavioral change need to be concrete and actionable. The application of theoretical frameworks to the study of risk (benefit) communication was infrequent, and developing predictive models of effective risk (benefit) communication may be contingent on improved theoretical perspectives.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Miscanthus is a genus of perennial C4 grasses native to East Asia. It includes the emerging ligno-cellulosic biomass crop M. *giganteus, a hybrid between M. sinensis and M. sacchariflorus Biomass yield and cold tolerance are of particular interest in Miscanthus, given that this crop is more temperate adapted than its C4 relatives maize, sorghum and sugarcane.; METHODS: A plant exploration was conducted in eastern Russia, at the northern extreme of the native range for Miscanthus, with collections including 174 clonal germplasm accessions (160 M. sacchariflorus and 14 M. sinensis) from 47 sites. Accessions were genotyped by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and plastid microsatellites.; KEY RESULTS: Miscanthus sinensis was found in maritime climates near Vladivostok (43·6°N) and on southern Sakhalin Island (46·6°N). Miscanthus sacchariflorus was found inland at latitudes as high as 49·3°N, where M. sinensis was absent. Most M. sacchariflorus accessions were diploid, but approx. 2 % were tetraploids. Molecular markers revealed little population structure (Jost's D < 0·007 among diploid groups) but high genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity = 0·14) within the collection of Russian M. sacchariflorus Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis for traits measured at the collection sites revealed three M. sacchariflorus single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with the number of stems per unit area, one with height and one with basal stem diameter; three were near or within previously described sorghum quantitative trait loci for related traits.; CONCLUSIONS: This new Miscanthus germplasm collection from eastern Russia will be useful for breeding Miscanthus and sugarcane cultivars with improved adaptation to cold. Moreover, a strategy is proposed to facilitate the rapid utilization of new germplasm collections: by implementing low-cost SNP genotyping to conduct GWA studies of phenotypic data obtained at collection sites, plant breeders can be provided with actionable information on which accessions have desirable traits and alleles. © The Author 2016.

AB Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a relatively rare malignancy that arises from the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic, perihilar and distal biliary tree. Intrahepatic CCA (ICC) represents the second most common primary liver cancer, after hepatocellular cancer. Two-thirds of the patients with ICC present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Despite standard treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin, prognosis remains dismal with a median survival of less than one year. Several biological plausibilities can account for its poor clinical outcomes. First, despite the advent of next generation and whole exome sequencing, no oncogenic addiction loops have been validated as clinically actionable targets. Second, the anatomical, pathological and molecular heterogeneity, and rarity of CCA confer an ongoing challenge of instituting adequately powered clinical trials. Last, most of the studies were not biomarker-driven, which may undermine the potential benefit of targeted therapy in distinct subpopulations carrying the unique molecular signature. Recent whole genome sequencing efforts have identified known mutations in genes such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (BRAF) and tumor protein p53 (TP53), novel mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), BRCA1-Associated Protein 1 (BAP1) and AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), and novel fusions such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1).

AB Large-scale genomic analyses of cutaneous melanoma have revealed insights into the aetiology and heterogeneity of this disease, as well as opportunities to further personalise treatment for patients with targeted and immune therapies. Herein, we review the proposed genomic classification of cutaneous melanoma from large-scale next-generation sequencing studies, including the largest integrative analysis of melanoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network. We examine studies that have identified molecular features of melanomas linked to immune checkpoint inhibitor response. In addition, we draw attention to low-frequency actionable mutations and highlight frequent non-coding mutations in melanoma where little is known about their biological function that may provide novel avenues for the development of treatment strategies for melanoma patients.

AB Functional genomics approaches such as gain- and loss-of-function screening can efficiently reveal genes that control cancer cell growth, survival, signal transduction, and drug resistance, but distilling the results of large-scale screens into actionable therapeutic strategies is challenging given our incomplete understanding of the functions of many genes. Research over several decades, including the results of large-scale cancer sequencing projects, has made it clear that many oncogenic properties are controlled by a common set of core oncogenic signaling pathways. By directly screening this core set of pathways, rather than much larger numbers of individual genes, it may be possible to more directly and efficiently connect functional genomic screening results with therapeutic targets. Here, we describe the recent development of methods to directly screen oncogenic pathways in high-throughput. We summarize the results of studies that have used pathway-centric screening to map the pathways of resistance to targeted therapies in diverse cancer types, then conclude by expanding on potential future applications of this approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Inappropriate prescribing increases patient illness and death owing to adverse drug events. The inclusion of genetic information into primary care medication practices is one solution. Our aim was to assess the ability to obtain and genotype saliva samples and to determine the levels of use of a decision support tool that creates medication options adjusted for patient characteristics, drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics.; METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in 6 primary care settings (5 family practices and 1 pharmacy), enrolling 191 adults with at least 1 of 10 common diseases. Saliva samples were obtained in the physician's office or pharmacy and sent to our laboratory, where DNA was extracted and genotyped and reports were generated. The reports were sent directly to the family physician/pharmacist and linked to an evidence-based prescribing decision support system. The primary outcome was ability to obtain and genotype samples. The secondary outcomes were yield and purity of DNA samples, ability to link results to decision support software and use of the decision support software.; RESULTS: Genotyping resulted in linking of 189 patients (99%) with pharmacogenetic reports to the decision support program. A total of 96.8% of samples had at least 1 actionable genotype for medications included in the decision support system. The medication support system was used by the physicians and pharmacists 236 times over 3 months.; INTERPRETATION: Physicians and pharmacists can collect saliva samples of sufficient quantity and quality for DNA extraction, purification and genotyping. A clinical decision support system with integrated data from pharmacogenetic tests may enable personalized prescribing within primary care. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02383290.

AB Recently, many states in India have invoked various provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 to control communicable diseases. In this context, the Act was reviewed with reference to its relevance in the current context of surveillance and other relevant Acts and legislations at the national and international levels. It is felt that the Act has major limitations in the current scenario as it is outdated, merely regulatory and not rights-based, and lacks a focus on the people. There is a need for an integrated, comprehensive, actionable and relevant legal provision for the control of outbreaks in India.

AB PURPOSE: In this review, we highlight the current concepts and discuss some of the current challenges and future prospects in cancer therapy. We frequently use the example of lung cancer.; METHODS: We conducted a nonsystematic PubMed search, selecting the most comprehensive and relevant research articles, clinical trials, translational papers, and review articles on precision oncology and immuno-oncology. Papers were prioritized and selected based on their originality and potential clinical applicability.; FINDINGS: Two major revolutions have changed cancer treatment paradigms in the past few years: targeting actionable alterations in oncogene-driven cancers and immuno-oncology. Important challenges are still ongoing in both fields of cancer therapy. On the one hand, druggable genomic alterations are diverse and represent only small subsets of patients in certain tumor types, which limits testing their clinical impact in biomarker-driven clinical trials. Next-generation sequencing technologies are increasingly being implemented for molecular prescreening in clinical research, but issues regarding clinical interpretation of large genomic data make their wide clinical use difficult. Further, dealing with tumor heterogeneity and acquired resistance is probably the main limitation for the success of precision oncology. On the other hand, long-term survival benefits with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed death cell protein-1/programmed death cell ligand-1[PD-1/L1] and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 monoclonal antibodies) are restricted to a minority of patients, and no predictive markers are yet robustly validated that could help us recognize these subsets and optimize treatment delivery and selection. To achieve long-term survival benefits, drug combinations targeting several molecular alterations or cancer hallmarks might be needed. This will probably be one of the most challenging but promising precision cancer treatment strategies in the future.; IMPLICATIONS: Targeting single molecular abnormalities or cancer pathways has achieved good clinical responses that have modestly affected survival in some cancers. However, this approach to cancer treatment is still reductionist, and many challenges need to be met to improve treatment outcomes with our patients. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

AB In spite of the development of new treatments for late stage prostate cancer, significant challenges persist to match individuals with effective targeted therapies. Genomic classification using high-throughput sequencing technologies has the potential to achieve this goal and make precision medicine a reality in the management of men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. This chapter reviews some of the most recent studies that have resulted in significant progress in determining the landscape of somatic genomic alterations in this cohort and, more importantly, have provided clinically actionable information that could guide treatment decisions. This chapter reviews the current understanding of common alterations such as alterations of the androgen receptor and PTEN pathway, as well as ETS gene fusions and the growing importance of PARP inhibition. It also reviews recent studies that characterize the evolution to neuroendocrine tumors, which is becoming an increasingly important clinical problem. Finally, this chapter reviews recent innovative studies that characterize the compelling evolutionary history of lethal prostate cancer evidenced by polyclonal seeding and interclonal cooperation between metastasis and the importance of tumor clone dynamics measured serially in response to treatment. The genomic landscape of late stage prostate cancer is becoming better defined, and the prospect for assigning clinically actionable data to inform rationale treatment for individuals with this disease is becoming a reality.

AB Clinical management of breast cancer is increasingly personalized and based on molecular profiling. Often, primary tumors are used as proxies for systemic disease at the time of recurrence. However, recent studies have revealed substantial discordances between primary tumors and metastases, both with respect to traditional clinical treatment targets and on the genomic and transcriptomic level. With the increasing use of molecularly targeted therapy, discordance of actionable molecular targets between primary tumors and recurrences can result in nonoptimal treatment or unnecessary side effects. The purpose of this review is to illuminate the extent of cancer genome evolution through disease progression and the degree of molecular concordance between primary breast cancers and matched metastases. We present an overview of the most prominent studies investigating the expression of endocrine receptors, transcriptomics, and genome aberrations in primary tumors and metastases. In conclusion, biopsy of metastatic lesions at recurrence of breast cancer is encouraged to provide optimal treatment of the disease. Furthermore, molecular profiling of metastatic tissue provides invaluable mechanistic insight into the biology underlying metastatic progression and has the potential to identify novel, potentially druggable, drivers of progression.  © 2016 The Authors.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship and the directionality between mobility and cognitive performance.; METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis of a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 327 community-dwelling adults (mean age=68.9±9.9 y; range, 40 to 100 y) categorized as having no mobility dysfunction, upper-extremity (UE) impairment, lower-extremity (LE) impairment, or mobility limitation (both UE and LE impairments), and compared by global cognition with multiple hierarchical linear regression adjusted for sociodemographic, health, and mood factors. A bootstrapping mediation analysis investigated the directionality of the mobility-cognition association.; RESULTS: LE (Est.=-2.95±0.77, P=0.001) but not UE impairment (Est.=-1.43±1.05, P=0.175) was associated with a poorer global cognitive performance/impairment. The presence of mobility limitation had the strongest effect on cognition (Est.=-3.78±1.09, P<0.001) adjusting for sociodemographic factors, body composition, comorbidities, and mood. Mediation analysis indicated that the relationship between cognition and mobility likely operates in both directions.; DISCUSSION: The association between cognitive function and mobility follows a dose-response pattern in which the likelihood of poor global cognition increases with the progression of mobility dysfunction, with evidence that LE impairments may be better indicators of an impaired cognitive status than UE impairments. Using brief, valid tools to screen older patients for early signs of mobility dysfunction, especially when the LE is affected, is feasible, and may provide the first detectable stage of future cognitive impairment and provide actionable steps for interventions to improve performance, reduce burden, and prevent the development of physical disability and loss of independence.

AB Recent genome-wide studies of malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS) have revolutionized our understanding of the biology of these tumors. This newly gained knowledge provides a wealth of opportunity for biomarker-driven clinical research. To date, however, only few of the available molecular markers truly influence clinical decision-making and treatment. The most widely validated markers in neuro-oncology presently are: (i) MGMT promoter methylation as a prognostic and predictive marker in glioblastoma; (ii) codeletion of 1p and 19q differentiating oligodendrogliomas from astrocytomas; (iii) IDH1/2 mutations; and (iv) select pathway-associated mutations. This article focuses on currently impactful biomarkers in adult and pediatric brain cancers and it provides a perspective on the direction of research in this field. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of surgical treatment for infective endocarditis complicated by cerebrovascular events is controversial, largely due to the perceived risk of perioperative intracranial bleeding. Current guidelines suggest waiting 2 weeks between the diagnosis of stroke and surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and neurological outcomes of early surgery following a stroke.; METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective analysis of 12 consecutive patients requiring surgery for infective endocarditis between 2011 and 2014 at Rush University Medical Center, with either ischemic (n=6) and/or hemorrhagic (n=6) cerebrovascular complications. All underwent computed tomographic angiography prior to early valve reconstructive surgery to identify potentially actionable neurological findings. Early valve surgery was performed for ongoing sepsis or persistent emboli. Neurologic risk and outcome were assessed pre- and postoperatively using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the Glasgow Outcome Scale, respectively.; RESULTS: All 12 patients underwent surgical treatment within 10 days of the diagnosis of stroke. Mortality in the immediate postoperative period was 8%. Eleven of the 12 patients exhibited good neurological recovery in the immediate postoperative period, with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score≥3. There was no correlation between duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and neurological outcomes.; CONCLUSION: Early cardiac surgery in patients with infective endocarditis and stroke maybe lifesaving with a low neurological risk. Comprehensive neurovascular imaging may help in identifying patient-related risk factors. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB The genomic events responsible for the pathogenesis of relapsed adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are not yet clear. We performed integrative analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, custom capture, whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq), and locus-specific genomic assays across nine time points from a patient with primary de novo B-ALL. Comprehensive genome and transcriptome characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4years later. Analysis of this patient's relapse genome revealed an unexpected, actionable therapeutic target that led to a specific therapy associated with a rapid clinical response. For some patients with relapsed or refractory cancers, this approach may indicate a novel therapeutic intervention that could alter outcome.

AB We propose that deregulated T-helper-cell (Th) signaling underlies evolving Th17 cytokine expression seen during progression of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Accordingly, we developed a lymphoma progression model comprising cell lines established at indolent (MAC-1) and aggressive (MAC-2A) CTCL stages. We discovered activating JAK3 (V722I) mutations present at indolent disease, reinforced in aggressive disease by novel compound heterozygous SOCS1 (G78R/D105N) JAK-binding domain inactivating mutations. Though isogenic, indolent and aggressive-stage cell lines had diverged phenotypically, the latter expressing multiple Th17 related cytokines, the former a narrower profile. Importantly, indolent stage cells remained poised for Th17 cytokine expression, readily inducible by treatment with IL-2 - a cytokine which mitigates Th17 differentiation in mice. In indolent stage cells JAK3 expression was boosted by IL-2 treatment. Th17 conversion of MAC-1 cells by IL-2 was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of JAK3 or STAT5, implicating IL2RG - JAK3 - STAT5 signaling in plasticity responses. Like IL-2 treatment, SOCS1 knockdown drove indolent stage cells to mimic key aggressive stage properties, notably IL17F upregulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that SOCS1 mutations abolished JAK3 binding, revealing a key role for SOCS1 in regulating JAK3/STAT5 signaling. Collectively, our results show how JAK/STAT pathway mutations contribute to disease progression in CTCL cells by potentiating inflammatory cytokine signaling, widening the potential therapeutic target range for this intractable entity. MAC-1/2A cells also provide a candidate human Th17 laboratory model for identifying potentally actionable CTCL markers or targets and testing their druggability in vitro.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeted postmortem genetic testing of the 4 major channelopathy-susceptibility genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, and RYR2) have yielded putative pathogenic mutations in ≤30% of autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death in the young (SUDY) cases with highest yields derived from the subset of exertion-related SUDY. Here, we evaluate the role of whole-exome sequencing in exertion-related SUDY cases.; METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1998 to 2010, 32 cases of exertion-related SUDY were referred by Medical Examiners for a cardiac channel molecular autopsy. A mutational analysis of the major long-QT syndrome-susceptibility genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-susceptibility gene (RYR2) identified a putative pathogenic mutation in 11 cases. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the remaining 21 targeted gene-negative SUDY cases. After whole-exome sequencing, a gene-specific surveillance of all genes (N=100) implicated in sudden death was performed to identify putative pathogenic mutation(s). Three of these 21 decedents had a clinically actionable, pathogenic mutation (CALM2-F90L, CALM2-N98S, and PKP2-N634fs). Of the 18 remaining cases, 7 hosted at least 1 variant of unknown significance with a minor allele frequency <1:20000. The overall yield of pathogenic mutations was higher among decedents aged 1 to 10 years (10/11, 91%) than those aged 11 to 19 years (4/21, 19%, P=0.0001).; CONCLUSIONS: Molecular screening in this clinical scenario is appropriate with a pathogenic mutation detection rate of 44% using direct DNA sequencing followed by whole-exome sequencing. Only 5 of the 100 interrogated sudden death genes hosted actionable pathogenic mutations for more than one third of these exertion-related, autopsy-negative SUDY cases. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: There is growing consensus that individual genetic research results that are scientifically robust, analytically valid, and clinically actionable should be offered to research participants. However, the general practice in European research projects is that results are usually not provided to research participants for many reasons. This article reports on the views of European experts and scholars who are members of the European COST Action CHIP ME IS1303 (Citizen's Health through public-private Initiatives: Public health, Market and Ethical perspectives) regarding challenges to the feedback of individual genetic results to research participants in Europe and potential strategies to address these challenges.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consultation of the COST Action members was conducted through an email survey and a workshop. The results from the consultation were analyzed following a conventional content analysis approach.; RESULTS: Legal frameworks, professional guidelines, and financial, organizational, and human resources to support the feedback of results are largely missing in Europe. Necessary steps to facilitate the feedback process include clarifying legal requirements to the feedback of results, developing harmonized European best practices, promoting interdisciplinary and cross-institutional collaboration, designing educational programs and cost-efficient IT-based platforms, involving research ethics committees, and documenting the health benefits and risks of the feedback process.; CONCLUSIONS: Coordinated efforts at pan-European level are needed to enable equitable, scientifically sound, and socially robust feedback of results to research participants.

AB Lung cancer contributes substantially to the global burden of disease and healthcare costs. New screening modalities using low-dose computerized tomography are promising tools for early detection leading to curative surgery. However, the screening and follow-up diagnostic procedures of these techniques may be costly. Focusing on prevention is an important factor to reduce the burden of screening, treatment, and lung cancer deaths. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has identified several lung carcinogens, which we believe can be considered actionable when developing prevention strategies. To curb the societal burden of lung cancer, healthcare resources need to be focused on early detection and screening and on mitigating exposure(s) of a person to known lung carcinogens, such as active tobacco smoking, household air pollution (HAP), and outdoor air pollution. Evidence has also suggested that these known lung carcinogens may be associated with genetic predispositions, supporting the hypothesis that lung cancers attributed to differing exposures may have developed from unique underlying genetic mechanisms attributed to the exposure of interest. For instance, smokingattributed lung cancer involves novel genetic markers of risk compared with HAP-attributed lung cancer. Therefore, genetic risk markers may be used in risk stratification to identify subpopulations that are at a higher risk for developing lung cancer attributed to a given exposure. Such targeted prevention strategies suggest that precision prevention strategies may be possible in the future; however, much work is needed to determine whether these strategies will be viable.

AB In the era of high-throughput molecular screening and personalized medicine, difficulty in determining whether cancer mutations are truly 'actionable' remains a gray zone in NSCLC. The most important prerequisite to perform such investigations is the tumor tissue retrieval via biopsy at diagnosis and after occurrence of resistance. Blood-based liquid biopsy as circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes can offer a fast and non-invasive method to elucidate the genetic heterogeneity of patients, the screening and patient stratification and give a dynamic surveillance for tumor progression and monitor treatments response. Here we prospectively discuss the three main approaches in the blood-biopsy field of lung cancer patients and its clinical applications in patient management. We also outline some of the analytical challenges that remain for liquid biopsy techniques in demonstrating that it could represent a true and actionable picture in lung cancer management for the implementation into clinical routine.

AB Hospital-associated infection (HAI) in immunocompromised patients can result in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are especially worrisome because of the limited choice of remaining antibiotics available when a patient becomes colonized or infected with an MDRO. It is therefore important that immunocompromised patients be cared for in an environment that limits the risk for acquiring infections. However, with healthcare being increasingly delivered in settings other than the traditional inpatient hospital wards, a bigger effort will need to be set forth to prevent or rapidly diagnose HAI. The last few years have seen a significant increase in the number of singleplex and multiplex molecular assays for the detection of many of the organisms responsible for HAI, but more is needed as infections caused by organisms like Legionella pneumophila and Aspergillus species are still diagnosed with methods that have relatively low yield and are slow to provide actionable results. Finally, the use of novel techniques for outbreak investigations will provide new information on transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings and allow stronger, evidence-based recommendations to be developed for prevention of HAIs in the immunocompromised host.

AB BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease and effective therapies for advanced stage disease are limited.; METHODS: In this study, distant metastases of 22 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer samples were sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM and the 50 gene AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 from 10ng of extracted DNA using 318 chips. Data analysis was performed with the Ion Torrent Variant Caller Plugin (hg19) and Golden Helix's SVS software for annotation and prediction of the significance of the variants.; RESULTS: All patients were female with a median age of 61years (range 37-85years). Metastatic sites included liver (n=6, 27%), skin (n=5, 23%), brain (n=4, 18%), lymph node (n=3, 14%), lung (n=2, 9%), retroperitoneum (n=1, 4.5%), and colon (n=1, 4.5%). Overall, 28 variants in 11 genes were observed. Five (23%) samples showed no alterations and 17 (77%) showed at least one potentially biologically significant variant (BSV) defined as having FDA-approved drugs or clinical trials evaluating their significance. BSVs included mutations in the following genes: TP53 (n=8), APC (n=4), PIK3CA (n=5), MET (n=2), ERBB2 (n=2), AKT1 (n=1), CDKN2A (n=1), KRAS (n=1), and FGFR3 (n=1).; CONCLUSIONS: Potentially actionable mutations were identified in the majority of breast cancer metastases. Evaluating metastatic breast tumors using a NGS approach provides a better understanding of the mechanisms behind tumor progression and evolution and also identifies additional potentially beneficial therapeutic targets for patient management or eligibility for clinical trials.

AB We present an article viewer application that allows a scientific reader to easily discover and share knowledge by linking genomics-related concepts to knowledge of disparate biomedical databases. High-throughput data streams generated by technical advancements have contributed to scientific knowledge discovery at an unprecedented rate. Biomedical Informaticists have created a diverse set of databases to store and retrieve the discovered knowledge. The diversity and abundance of such resources present biomedical researchers a challenge with knowledge discovery. These challenges highlight a need for a better informatics solution. We use a text mining algorithm, Genomine, to identify gene symbols from the text of a journal article. The identified symbols are supplemented with information from the GenoDB knowledgebase. Self-updating GenoDB contains information from NCBI Gene, Clinvar, Medgen, dbSNP, KEGG, PharmGKB, Uniprot, and Hugo Gene databases. The journal viewer is a web application accessible via a web browser. The features described herein are accessible on www.genotation.org The Genomine algorithm identifies gene symbols with an accuracy shown by .65 F-Score. GenoDB currently contains information regarding 59,905 gene symbols, 5633 drug-gene relationships, 5981 gene-disease relationships, and 713 pathways. This application provides scientific readers with actionable knowledge related to concepts of a manuscript. The reader will be able to save and share supplements to be visualized in a graphical manner. This provides convenient access to details of complex biological phenomena, enabling biomedical researchers to generate novel hypothesis to further our knowledge in human health. This manuscript presents a novel application that integrates genomic, proteomic, and pharmacogenomic information to supplement content of a biomedical manuscript and enable readers to automatically discover actionable knowledge.  © 2016 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Monitoring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) may improve safety of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.; OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the performance of an interactive voice-inquiry dial-response system (IVRDS) in detecting CKD-pertinent adverse safety events outside of the clinical environment and compare the incidence of events using the IVDRS to that detected by paper diary.; METHODS: This was a 6-month study of Stage III-V CKD patients in the Safe Kidney Care (SKC) study. Participants crossed over from a paper diary to the IVDRS for recording patient-reported safety events defined as symptoms or events attributable to medications or care. The IVDRS was adapted from the SKC paper diary to record event frequency and remediation. Participants were auto-called weekly and permitted to self-initiate calls. Monthly reports were reviewed by two physician adjudicators for their clinical significance.; RESULTS: 52 participants were followed over a total of 1384 weeks. 28 out of 52 participants (54%) reported events using the IVDRS versus 8 out of 52 (15%) with the paper diary; hypoglycemia was the most common event for both methods. All IVDRS menu options were selected at least once except for confusion and rash. Events were reported on 121 calls, with 8 calls reporting event remediation by ambulance or emergency room (ER) visit. The event rate with the IVDRS and paper diary, with and without hypoglycemia, was 26.7 versus 4.7 and 18.3 versus 0.8 per 100 person weeks, respectively (P=.002 and P<.001). The frequent users (ie, >10 events) largely differed by method, and event rates excluding the most frequent user of each were 16.9 versus 2.5 per 100 person weeks, respectively (P<.001). Adjudicators found approximately half the 80 reports clinically significant, with about a quarter judged as actionable. Hypoglycemia was often associated with additional reports of fatigue and falling. Participants expressed favorable satisfaction with the IVDRS.; CONCLUSIONS: Use of the IVDRS among CKD patients reveals a high frequency of clinically significant safety events and has the potential to be used as an important supplement to clinical care for improving patient safety.

AB Survival for lung cancer patients remains dismal and is largely attributed to treatment resistance. To identify novel target genes the modulation of which could modify platinum resistance, we performed a high-throughput RNAi screen and identified Yes-associated protein (YAP1), a transcription coactivator and a known oncogene, as a potential actionable candidate. YAP1 ablation significantly improved sensitivities not only to cisplatin but also to ionizing radiation, both of which are DNA-damaging interventions, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Overall YAP1 was expressed in 75% of NSCLC specimens, whereas nuclear YAP1 which is the active form was present in 45% of 124 resected NSCLC. Interestingly, EGFR-mutated or KRAS-mutated NSCLC were associated with higher nuclear YAP1 staining in comparison to EGFR/KRAS wild-type. Relevantly, YAP1 downregulation improved sensitivity to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor. A pharmacological inhibitor of YAP1 signaling, verteporfin also synergized with cisplatin, radiation and erlotinib in NSCLC cells by potentiating cisplatin and radiation-related double-stranded breaks and decreasing expression of YAP1 and EGFR. Taken together, our study is the first to indicate the potential role of YAP1 as a common modulator of resistance mechanisms and a potential novel, actionable target that can improve responses to platinum, radiation and EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Written comments by medical student supervisors provide written foundation for grade narratives and deans' letters and play an important role in student's professional development. Written comments are widely used but little has been published about the quality of written comments. We hypothesized that medical students share an understanding of qualities inherent to a high-quality and a low-quality narrative comment and we aimed to determine the features that define high- and low-quality comments.; METHODS: Using the well-established anthropological pile-sort method, medical students sorted written comments into 'helpful' and 'unhelpful' piles, then were interviewed to determine how they evaluated comments. We used multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis to analyze data, revealing how written comments were sorted across student participants. We calculated the degree of shared knowledge to determine the level of internal validity in the data. We transcribed and coded data elicited during the structured interview to contextualize the student's answers. Length of comment was compared using one-way analysis of variance; valence and frequency comments were thought of as helpful were analyzed by chi-square.; RESULTS: Analysis of written comments revealed four distinct clusters. Cluster A comments reinforced good behaviors or gave constructive criticism for how changes could be made. Cluster B comments exhorted students to continue non-specific behaviors already exhibited. Cluster C comments used grading rubric terms without giving student-specific examples. Cluster D comments used sentence fragments lacking verbs and punctuation. Student data exhibited a strong fit to the consensus model, demonstrating that medical students share a robust model of attributes of helpful and unhelpful comments. There was no correlation between valence of comment and perceived helpfulness.; CONCLUSIONS: Students find comments demonstrating knowledge of the student and providing specific examples of appropriate behavior to be reinforced or inappropriate behavior to be eliminated helpful, and comments that are non-actionable and non-specific to be least helpful. Our research and analysis allow us to make recommendations helpful for faculty development around written feedback.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence is needed to develop effective educational programs for promoting evidence based practice (EBP) and knowledge translation (KT) in physical therapy. This study reports long-term outcomes from a feasibility assessment of an educational program designed to promote the integration of research evidence into physical therapist practice.; METHODS: Eighteen physical therapists participated in the 6-month Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (PEAK) program. The participant-driven active learning program consisted of four consecutive, interdependent components: 1) acquiring managerial leadership support and electronic resources in three clinical practices, 2) a 2-day learner-centered EBP training workshop, 3) 5 months of guided small group work synthesizing research evidence into a locally relevant list of, actionable, evidence-based clinical behaviors for therapists treating persons with musculoskeletal lumbar conditions--the Best Practices List, and 4) review and revision of the Best Practices List, culminating in participant agreement to implement the behaviors in practice. Therapists' EBP learning was assessed with standardized measures of EBP-related attitudes, self-efficacy, knowledge and skills, and self-reported behavior at baseline, immediately-post, and 6 months following conclusion of the program (long-term follow-up). Therapist adherence to the Best Practice List before and after the PEAK program was assessed through chart review.; RESULTS: Sixteen therapists completed the long-term follow-up assessment. EBP self-efficacy and self-reported behaviors increased from baseline to long-term follow-up (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). EBP-related knowledge and skills showed a trend for improvement from baseline to long-term follow-up (p=0.05) and a significant increase from immediate-post to long-term follow-up (p=0.02). Positive attitudes at baseline were sustained throughout (p=0.208). Eighty-nine charts were analyzed for therapist adherence to the Best Practices List. Six clinical behaviors had sufficient pre- and post-PEAK charts to justify analysis. Of those, one behavior showed a statistically significant increase in adherence, one had high pre- and post-PEAK adherence, and four were change resistant, starting with low adherence and showing no meaningful improvement.; CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the feasibility of the PEAK program to produce long-term improvements in physical therapists' EBP-related self-efficacy and self-reported behavior. EBP knowledge and skills showed improvement from post-intervention to long-term follow-up and a trend toward long-term improvements. However, chart review of therapists' adherence to the participant generated Best Practices List in day-to-day patient care indicates a need for additional support to facilitate behavior change. Future versions of the PEAK program and comparable multi-faceted EBP and KT educational programs should provide ongoing monitoring, feedback, and problem-solving to successfully promote behavior change for knowledge translation.

AB Personalized medicine uses genomic information for selecting therapy in patients with metastatic cancer. An issue is the optimal tissue source (primary tumor or metastasis) for testing. We compared the DNA copy number and mutational profiles of primary breast cancers and paired metastases from 23 patients using whole-genome array-comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing of 365 "cancer-associated" genes. Primary tumors and metastases harbored copy number alterations (CNAs) and mutations common in breast cancer and showed concordant profiles. The global concordance regarding CNAs was shown by clustering and correlation matrix, which showed that each metastasis correlated more strongly with its paired tumor than with other samples. Genes with recurrent amplifications in breast cancer showed 100% (ERBB2, FGFR1), 96% (CCND1), and 88% (MYC) concordance for the amplified/non-amplified status. Among all samples, 499 mutations were identified, including 39 recurrent (AKT1, ERBB2, PIK3CA, TP53) and 460 non-recurrent variants. The tumors/metastases concordance of variants was 75%, higher for recurrent (92%) than for non-recurrent (73%) variants. Further mutational discordance came from very different variant allele frequencies for some variants. We showed that the chosen targeted therapy in two clinical trials of personalized medicine would be concordant in all but one patient (96%) when based on the molecular profiling of tumor and paired metastasis. Our results suggest that the genotyping of primary tumor may be acceptable to guide systemic treatment if the metastatic sample is not obtainable. However, given the rare but potentially relevant divergences for some actionable driver genes, the profiling of metastatic sample is recommended.

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly heterogenic disease, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. Common chemotherapies are not very effective for GC, which often presents as an advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Treatment options are limited, and the prognosis for advanced GCs is poor. The landscape of genomic alterations in GCs has recently been characterized by several international cancer genome programs, including studies that focused exclusively on GCs in Asians. These studies identified major recurrent driver mutations and provided new insights into the mutational heterogeneity and genetic profiles of GCs. An analysis of gene expression data by the Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) further uncovered four distinct molecular subtypes with well-defined clinical features and their intersections with actionable genetic alterations to which targeted therapeutic agents are either already available or under clinical development. In this article, we review the ACRG GC project. We also discuss the implications of the genetic and molecular findings from various GC genomic studies with respect to developing more precise diagnoses and treatment approaches for GCs.

AB Sequencing tests assaying panels of genes or whole exomes are widely available for cancer risk evaluation. However, methods for classification of variants resulting from this testing are not well studied. We evaluated the ability of a variant-classification methodology based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to define the rate of mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 180 medically relevant genes, including all ACMG-designated reportable cancer and non-cancer-associated genes, in individuals who met guidelines for hereditary cancer risk evaluation. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 404 individuals in 253 families and classified 1,640 variants. Potentially clinically actionable (likely pathogenic [LP] or pathogenic [P]) versus nonactionable (VUS, likely benign, or benign) calls were 95% concordant with locus-specific databases and Clinvar. LP or P mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2 mutations (11%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P mutations in only two additional families (0.8%). However, individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9%) had incidental LP or P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9% of individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 95% of individuals had at least one VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG variant-classification guidelines. Additionally, evaluation of extended panels of cancer-associated genes in breast/ovarian cancer families leads to only an incremental clinical benefit but substantially increases the complexity of the results.

AB BACKGROUND/AIM: Individual molecular information might improve management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To identify actionable genes, at the transcriptional level, we investigated candidate genes that we had previously identified using array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 10 public gene-expression datasets, gathering a total of 524 pancreatic samples (105 normal and 419 malignant tissues). Based on our previous aCGH analysis, we searched for genes differentially expressed between normal and malignant samples and genes associated with survival.; RESULTS: Among genes amplified/gained by aCGH, 48% were overexpressed in malignant tissues. The majority of these genes were related to apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation and differentiation. Among genes located in areas of loss, 41% were underexpressed in malignant tissues; most of them were involved in ion transport, homeostasis maintenance and fatty acid metabolism. Survival analysis identified genes significantly related to shorter (n=17) or longer (n=29) survival.; CONCLUSION: Some of these genes can be further investigated as potential prognostic markers.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumors has been heralded as a promising tool to identify 'actionable' abnormalities susceptible to therapies targeting these mutated genes. Inhibiting the oncoprotein expressed from a single dominant mutated gene (oncogene) forms the basis for the success of most of the targeted gene therapies approved in the last several years. The well over 20 FDA-approved kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment are examples [Janne et al.: Nat Rev Drug Discov 2009;8: 709-723]. These and other similar agents in development might prove effective therapies for tumors originating from tissues other than those for which these drugs are currently approved. Finding such mutations in tumors of patients through NGS is being aggressively pursued by patients and their oncologists. For identified mutated tumor suppressor genes (TSG) the challenge is really the opposite. Rather than inhibiting the action of an oncoprotein, targeting would involve restoring the activity of the wild-type (WT) TSG function [Knudson: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1971;249: 912-915]. Here, a case is reported that illustrates the implications of a mutated TSG (BRIP1) identified by NGS as potentially actionable. In such cases, measuring allelic mutation frequency potentially allows for the identification of tumors where the loss of heterozygosity of a TSG exists. Without substantial loss of expression of the WT TSG product, it would seem very unlikely that 'replacing' a WT TSG product that is not a lost product would be a useful therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeted therapies including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors have dramatically changed the treatment of cancer over past 10years. Their therapeutic advantages are more tumor specific and with less side effects. For precisely tailoring available targeted therapies to each individual or a subset of cancer patients, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been utilized as a promising diagnosis tool with its advantages of accuracy, sensitivity, and high throughput.; METHODS: We developed and validated a NGS-based cancer genomic diagnosis targeting 115 prognosis and therapeutics relevant genes on multiple specimen including blood, tumor tissue, and body fluid from 10 patients with different cancer types. The sequencing data was then analyzed by the clinical-applicable analytical pipelines developed in house.; RESULTS: We have assessed analytical sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the NGS-based molecular diagnosis. Also, our developed analytical pipelines were capable of detecting base substitutions, indels, and gene copy number variations (CNVs). For instance, several actionable mutations of EGFR,PIK3CA,TP53, and KRAS have been detected for indicating drug susceptibility and resistance in the cases of lung cancer.; CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that NGS-based molecular diagnosis is more sensitive and comprehensive to detect genomic alterations in cancer, and supports a direct clinical use for guiding targeted therapy.

AB Comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing technologies provides insights into understanding the genomic architecture of human cancer. This new understanding of the cancer genome allows us to identify many more genomic alterations occurring within tumors than before, some of which could be potential therapeutic targets through molecular targeted agents. Currently, a large number of molecular targeted agents are being developed, and consequently, cancer treatment is rapidly shifting from empiric therapy employing cytotoxic anticancer drugs to genotype-directed therapy using molecular targeted agents. In current daily clinical practice, hotspot-based single-gene assays that detect RAS mutations in colorectal cancer or EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer are widely used to identify variants. However, it is becoming evident that more comprehensive genomic analysis is crucial in identifying the patient population that may benefit from molecular targeted therapy and the accelerated development of novel drugs for early clinical trials. For these purposes, an increasing number of gene panel-based targeted sequencing is commercially available in clinical practice from sequencing companies. Despite several challenges in implementing this approach, comprehensive genomic profiling and identification of actionable mutations is likely to become one of the standard options in the management of cancer in the near future. The use of clinical sequencing has the potential to usher a new era in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we discuss the application of comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing technologies in clinical oncology and address the current challenges for its implementation.  © The Author 2016.

AB BACKGROUND: Staple line leak after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a rare but dreaded complication with a reported incidence of 0% to 8%. Many surgeons routinely test the staple line with an intraoperative leak test (IOLT), but there is little evidence to validate this practice. In fact, there is a theoretical concern that the leak test may weaken the staple line and increase the risk of a postop leak.; METHODS: Retrospective review of all SGs performed over a 7-year period was conducted. Cases were grouped by whether an IOLT was performed, and compared for the incidence of postop staple line leaks. The ability of the IOLT for identifying a staple line defect and for predicting a postoperative leak was analyzed.; RESULTS: Five hundred forty-two SGs were performed between 2007 and 2014. Thirteen patients (2.4%) developed a postop staple line leak. The majority of patients (n = 494, 91%) received an IOLT, including all 13 patients (100%) who developed a subsequent clinical leak. There were no (0%) positive IOLTs and no additional interventions were performed based on the IOLT. The IOLT sensitivity and positive predictive value were both 0%. There was a trend, although not significant, to increase leak rates when a routine IOLT was performed vs no routine IOLT (2.6% vs 0%, P = .6).; CONCLUSIONS: The performance of routine IOLT after SG provided no actionable information, and was negative in all patients who developed a postoperative leak. The routine use of an IOLT did not reduce the incidence of postop leak, and in fact was associated with a higher leak rate after SG. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular technologies have allowed laboratories to detect and establish the profiles of human cancers by identifying a variety of somatic variants. In order to improve personalized patient care, we have established a next-generation sequencing (NGS) test to screen for somatic variants in primary or advanced cancers. In this study, we describe the laboratory quality management program for NGS testing, and also provide an overview of the somatic variants identified in over 1000 patient samples as well as their implications in clinical practice.; METHODS: Over the past one-and-a-half years, our laboratory received a total of 1028 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues, which consisted of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), colon adenocarcinomas, glioma/glioblastomas, melanomas, breast carcinomas, and other tumor types. During this time period, we implemented a series of quality control (QC) checks that included (1) pre-DNA extraction, (2) DNA quantification, (3) DNA quality, (4) library quantification, (5) post-emulsification PCR, and (6) post-sequencing metrics. At least 10 ng of genomic DNA (gDNA) were used to prepare barcoded libraries using the AmpliSeq CHPv2. Samples were multiplexed and sequenced on Ion Torrent 318 chips using the Ion PGM System. Variants were identified using the Variant Caller Plugin, and annotation and functional predictions were performed using the Golden Helix SVS.; RESULTS: A total of 1005 samples passed QC1-3, and following additional library preparation QC checkpoints, 877 samples were sequenced. Samples were classified into two categories: wild-type (127) and positive for somatic variants (750). Somatic variants were classified into clinically actionable (60%) and non-actionable (40%).; CONCLUSIONS: The use of NGS in routine clinical laboratory practice allowed for the detection of tumor profiles that are essential for the selection of targeted therapies and identification of applicable clinical trials, contributing to the improvement of personalized patient care in oncology.

AB The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in theJournal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published inJournal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.A 78-year-old woman with a 40-pack-year smoking history has been referred for treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. She presented with a persistent cough and worsening dyspnea on exertion. A chest x-ray followed by a chest computed tomography scan revealed a 3-cm right upper lobe mass along with a moderate-size pleural effusion. Pleural fluid cytology was positive for adenocarcinoma. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was negative. A reflex molecular profile, includingKRAS,EGFR,ALK,BRAF,HER2,RET,MET, andROS, did not reveal an actionable abnormality. Her past medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and osteopenia. Her medications include a beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, oral antidiabetic agent, calcium, and vitamin D. The laboratory evaluation is notable for a hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL and a creatinine clearance of 36 mL/min. The other laboratories are within normal limits. She is somewhat limited by the shortness of breath but maintains an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. She is independent in all of her instrumental and basic activities of daily living and denies falls. She has been referred to discuss treatment options.  © 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB PURPOSE: Gene panel sequencing is revolutionizing germline risk assessment for hereditary breast cancer. Despite scant evidence supporting the role of many of these genes in breast cancer predisposition, results are often reported to families as the definitive explanation for their family history. We assessed the frequency of mutations in 18 genes included in hereditary breast cancer panels among index cases from families with breast cancer and matched population controls.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases (n = 2,000) were predominantly breast cancer-affected women referred to specialized Familial Cancer Centers on the basis of a strong family history of breast cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild type. Controls (n = 1,997) were cancer-free women from the LifePool study. Sequencing data were filtered for known pathogenic or novel loss-of-function mutations.; RESULTS: Excluding 19 mutations identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2 among the cases and controls, a total of 78 cases (3.9%) and 33 controls (1.6%) were found to carry potentially actionable mutations. A significant excess of mutations was only observed for PALB2 (26 cases, four controls) and TP53 (five cases, zero controls), whereas no mutations were identified in STK11. Among the remaining genes, loss-of-function mutations were rare, with similar frequency between cases and controls.; CONCLUSION: The frequency of mutations in most breast cancer panel genes among individuals selected for possible hereditary breast cancer is low and, in many cases, similar or even lower than that observed among cancer-free population controls. Although multigene panels can significantly aid in cancer risk management and expedite clinical translation of new genes, they equally have the potential to provide clinical misinformation and harm at the individual level if the data are not interpreted cautiously. © 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB In 2014 both the Institute of Medicine and the National Quality Forum recommended the inclusion of social determinants of health data in electronic health records (EHRs). Both entities primarily focus on collecting socioeconomic and health behavior data directly from individual patients. The burden of reliably, accurately, and consistently collecting such information is substantial, and it may take several years before a primary care team has actionable data available in its EHR. A more reliable and less burdensome approach to integrating clinical and social determinant data exists and is technologically feasible now. Community vital signs-aggregated community-level information about the neighborhoods in which our patients live, learn, work, and play-convey contextual social deprivation and associated chronic disease risks based on where patients live. Given widespread access to "big data" and geospatial technologies, community vital signs can be created by linking aggregated population health data with patient addresses in EHRs. These linked data, once imported into EHRs, are a readily available resource to help primary care practices understand the context in which their patients reside and achieve important health goals at the patient, population, and policy levels. © Copyright 2016 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB Although there have been tremendous advances in the understanding of human dysfunctions in the brain circuitry for self-reflection, emotion, and cognitive control, a brain-based taxonomy for mental disease is still lacking. As a result, these advances have not been translated into actionable clinical tools, and the language of brain circuits has not been incorporated into training programmes. To address this gap, I present this synthesis of published work, with a focus on functional imaging of circuit dysfunctions across the spectrum of mood and anxiety disorders. This synthesis provides the foundation for a taxonomy of putative types of dysfunction, which cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries for depression and anxiety and includes instead distinct types of neural circuit dysfunction that together reflect the heterogeneity of depression and anxiety. This taxonomy is suited to specifying symptoms in terms of underlying neural dysfunction at the individual level and is intended as the foundation for building mechanistic research and ultimately guiding clinical practice.

AB Brain metastasis is a serious complication of cancer that causes significant morbidity for patients. Over the last decade, numerous new driver somatic mutations have been recognized and targeted therapies are changing the landscape of treatment in lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, which are also the three most common cancers that result in brain metastases. The common actionable mutations include the EGFR mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations in non-small cell lung cancer, the HER2 mutation in breast cancer, and the BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, most of the early trials with targeted agents excluded patients with brain metastases. With a better understanding of the biology, several recent trials of targeted therapy that focus on brain metastases have been reported and others are ongoing. Novel agents with better penetration across the blood-brain barrier are currently being investigated for patients with brain metastases. In this review, we discuss the current state of use and future directions of targeted therapies in brain metastases.

AB We report the first combined analysis of whole-genome sequence, detailed clinical history, and transcriptome sequence of multiple prostate cancer metastases in a single patient (A21). Whole-genome and transcriptome sequence was obtained from nine anatomically separate metastases, and targeted DNA sequencing was performed in cancerous and noncancerous foci within the primary tumor specimen removed 5 yr before death. Transcriptome analysis revealed increased expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes in liver metastases that harbored an AR p.L702H mutation, suggesting a dominant effect by the mutation despite being present in only one of an estimated 16 copies per cell. The metastases harbored several alterations to the PI3K/AKT pathway, including a clonal truncal mutation in PIK3CG and present in all metastatic sites studied. The list of truncal genomic alterations shared by all metastases included homozygous deletion of TP53, hemizygous deletion of RB1 and CHD1, and amplification of FGFR1. If the patient were treated today, given this knowledge, the use of second-generation androgen-directed therapies, cessation of glucocorticoid administration, and therapeutic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway or FGFR1 receptor could provide personalized benefit. Three previously unreported truncal clonal missense mutations (ABCC4 p.R891L, ALDH9A1 p.W89R, and ASNA1 p.P75R) were expressed at the RNA level and assessed as druggable. The truncal status of mutations may be critical for effective actionability and merit further study. Our findings suggest that a large set of deeply analyzed cases could serve as a powerful guide to more effective prostate cancer basic science and personalized cancer medicine clinical trials.

AB Information technologies have drastically altered the way patients gather health-related information. By analysing web resources on tonsillectomy, we expose information quality and dynamics of patients' interactions in the online continuum. Readability was assessed using Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), Flesch Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Gunning Fog Index (GFI). Comprehensibility and actionability were assessed using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Metrics of forums included author characteristics (level of disclosure, gender, age, avatar image, etc.), posts' motive (community support vs. medical information) and content (word count, emoticon use, number of replies, etc.). Analysis of 6 professional medical websites, of 10 health information portals, and of 3 discussion forums totalizing 1369 posts on 358 threads, from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2014, reveals that online resources exceed understandability recommendations. Women were more present on online health forums (68.2% of authors disclosing their gender) and invested themselves more in their avatar. Authors replying were significantly older than authors of original posts (39.7±0.8years vs. 29.2±0.9years, p<0.001). The degree of self-disclosure was inversely proportional to the requests for medical information (p<0.001). Men and women were equally seeking medical information (men: 74.0%, women: 77.0%) and community support (men: 65.7%, women: 70.4%), however women responded more supportively (women 86.2%, men 59.1%, p<0.001). The dynamics of patients' interactions used to overcome accessibility difficulties encountered is complex. This work outlines the necessity for comprehensible medical information to adequately answer patients' needs.

The impact of chemotherapy on survival is unclear and there are no standard-of-care treatments for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease. This article reviews recently completed and ongoing clinical trials for patients with ACC and describes recently identified potentially targetable genomic alterations in this orphan disease.; RECENT FINDINGS: In spite of an overall low mutational burden, genotyping of ACC samples has shed some light about the disease biology. In addition to the frequent translocations involving MYB or MYBL, recurrent alterations in genes involved in chromatin deregulation, FGF, PI3K, NOTCH1, and DNA damage repair pathways have been identified. Many of these genomic alterations are targetable and drug screening is ongoing in genotyped ACC patient-derived murine xenografts.; SUMMARY: Clinical studies with targeted agents in unselected ACC patients have not been promising thus far. The identification of potential driver oncogenes suggests that targeted therapy might be effective in molecularly-defined patient subgroups and merits investigation in future clinical studies.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A number of molecular and genomic biomarkers that possess the ability to guide treatment or 'actionable targets' are being reported in metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, pathways of resistance to existing therapies and novel agents to overcome them are currently under active investigation. The next wave of investigations is focused on personalized therapy of prostate cancer. The focus of this review article is to provide an update on clinical development in advanced prostate cancer and to highlight the ongoing investigations of biomarker discovery, and ways of overcoming therapeutic resistance. The next generation of clinical trials developing novel targets and compounds promises to be in populations enriched with specific marker expression.; RECENT FINDINGS: The breakthrough report, of the ability of the androgen receptor variant 7 mutation, detected in circulating tumor cells, to predict the lack of response to abiraterone or enzalutamide, and the remarkable responses of poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors in prostate cancer with DNA repair mutations have elevated hopes of a bright future in the biomarker-driven therapeutic arena. Novel targets such as bromodomain extra terminal-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hold promise for the possibility of overcoming resistance. Novel hormone agents are also under active study.; SUMMARY: As the clinical application of the multifaceted therapies narrows down to enriched patient populations selected by genomic testing, the therapeutic efficiency will escalate considerably. Novel targets, resistance mechanisms and relevant agents are being avidly tested, and the dream of personalized medicine is emerging into reality.

AB OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to review information within the situation reports (SITREPs) and incident notices (INs) prepared by the Division of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response/Epidemiology Surveillance and Response Branch, (DBPR/ESRB), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The secondary objective is to evaluate accuracy and completeness of the information provided in these documents.; METHODS: The authors reviewed all SITREPs/INs prepared by DBPR/ESRB from January 2007 to June 2009. Data were abstracted for variables related to the type of incidents, the type of CDC assistance requested, the geographic origin of the calls, and the organization reporting the event or requesting CDC assistance or both. In addition, variables were also created to assess the accuracy and completeness of reports for quality improvement analysis.; RESULTS: The DBPR/ESRB prepared 77 SITREPs and 22 INs. Most of them were related to unknown white powders/suspicious packages or BioWatch Actionable Reports (78%). Most calls (79%), requesting CDC assistance or not, were domestic. Almost all calls requesting CDC assistance were for clinical and/or laboratory consultation and/or request for analysis of samples. Most of the calls requesting CDC assistance came from city, county, state, or federal government agencies and military organizations (82%). However, 14 of the analyzed documents (14.4%) were misclassified, that is, a SITREP was written when it should have been an IN or vice versa. The authors also noted the absence of some relevant information among some of the documents, for example, date/time of update.; CONCLUSIONS: All of the issues/incidents reported in this article to which DBPR/ESRB responded were cause for legitimate concern. However, significant improvement can be made in the preparation of these reports by CDC staff to ensure efficient and effective response from CDC and its partners. Finally, local entities may wish to develop a similar documentation and reporting process to help manage significant incidents.

AB BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), a programme of exercise, education and psycho-social support, is recommended for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but referral rates are relatively low compared with need.; AIM: Working with primary care clinicians (GPs and practice nurses) from eight practices, this project developed strategies for influencing clinician and patient behaviours as a means of increasing referral rates for PR.; METHODS: A participatory action research design was employed. Semi-structured questionnaires captured clinicians' baseline knowledge of PR and their ideas for increasing referrals. Actionable changes were then recommended. Audits (at baseline, mid-point and end of project) were used to assess and initiate improvements in the quality of practice data about PR referrals. The impacts of these changes were explored via further clinician surveys (free text questionnaire). Semi-structured questionnaires, posted to patients eligible for PR, assessed their characteristics, and, where applicable, their views on PR referral processes and reasons for not wanting PR.; FINDINGS: The baseline survey of clinicians (n=22) revealed inadequate knowledge about PR, particularly among GPs. Actionable changes recommended included in-house education sessions, changes to practice protocols, and 'pop-ups' and memory aids (mugs and coasters) to prompt clinician/patient discussions about PR. Audit findings resulted in changes to improve the quality and availability of coded information about patients eligible for PR. These changes, supported by clinicians (n=9) in the follow-up survey, aimed to facilitate and increase the quality of patient/clinician discussions about PR. Findings from the patient survey (n=126, response rate 25.7%) indicate that such changes will increase the uptake of PR as patients who accepted a referral for PR provided more positive feedback about their discussions with clinicians.; CONCLUSIONS: The strategies introduced were relatively easy to implement and the anticipated advantage is more patients accessing the health and quality of life benefits that PR offers.

AB Importance: Pediatric cancers represent a unique case with respect to cancer genomics and precision medicine, as the mutation frequency is low, and targeted therapies are less available. Consequently, it is unknown whether clinical sequencing can be of benefit.; Objective: To assess the feasibility of identifying actionable alterations and making individualized cancer therapy (iCat) recommendations in pediatric patients with extracranial solid tumors.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Clinical sequencing study at 4 academic medical centers enrolling patients between September 5, 2012, and November 19, 2013, with 1 year of clinical follow-up. Participants were 30 years or younger with high-risk, recurrent, or refractory extracranial solid tumors. The data analysis was performed October 28, 2014.; Interventions: Tumor profiling performed on archived clinically acquired specimens consisted of mutation detection by a Sequenom assay or targeted next-generation sequencing and copy number assessment by array comparative genomic hybridization. Results were reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel, and iCat recommendations were made if an actionable alteration was present, and an appropriate drug was available.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Feasibility was assessed using a 2-stage design based on the proportion of patients with recommendations.; Results: Of 100 participants (60 male; median [range] age, 13.4 [0.8-29.8] years), profiling was technically successful in 89 (89% [95% CI, 83%-95%]). Median (range) follow-up was 6.8 (2.0-23.6) months. Overall, 31 (31% [95% CI, 23%-41%]) patients received an iCat recommendation and 3 received matched therapy. The most common actionable alterations leading to an iCat recommendation were cancer-associated signaling pathway gene mutations (n=10) and copy number alterations in MYC/MYCN (n=6) and cell cycle genes (n=11). Additional alterations with implications for clinical care but not resulting in iCat recommendations were identified, including mutations indicating the possible presence of a cancer predisposition syndrome and translocations suggesting a change in diagnosis. In total, 43 (43% [95% CI, 33%-53%]) participants had results with potential clinical significance.; Conclusions and Relevance: A multi-institution clinical genomics study in pediatric oncology is feasible and a substantial proportion of relapsed or refractory pediatric solid tumors have actionable alterations.; Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01853345.

AB Importance: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has the potential to reveal tumor and germline mutations of clinical relevance, but the diagnostic yield for pediatric patients with solid tumors is unknown.; Objective: To characterize the diagnostic yield of combined tumor and germline WES for children with solid tumors.; Design: Unselected children with newly diagnosed and previously untreated central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors were prospectively enrolled in the BASIC3 study at a large academic children's hospital during a 23-month period from August 2012 through June 2014. Blood and tumor samples underwent WES in a certified clinical laboratory with genetic results categorized on the basis of perceived clinical relevance and entered in the electronic health record.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical categorization of somatic mutations; frequencies of deleterious germline mutations related to patient phenotype and incidental medically-actionable mutations.; Results: Of the first 150 participants (80 boys and 70 girls, mean age, 7.4 years), tumor samples adequate for WES were available from 121 patients (81%). Somatic mutations of established clinical utility (category I) were reported in 4 (3%) of 121 patients, with mutations of potential utility (category II) detected in an additional 29 (24%) of 121 patients. CTNNB1 was the gene most frequently mutated, with recurrent mutations in KIT, TSC2, and MAPK pathway genes (BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS) also identified. Mutations in consensus cancer genes (category III) were found in an additional 24 (20%) of 121 tumors. Fewer than half of somatic mutations identified were in genes known to be recurrently mutated in the tumor type tested. Diagnostic germline findings related to patient phenotype were discovered in 15 (10%) of 150 cases: 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic dominant mutations in adult and pediatric cancer susceptibility genes (including 2 each in TP53, VHL, and BRCA1), 1 recessive liver disorder with hepatocellular carcinoma (TJP2), and 1 renal diagnosis (CLCN5). Incidental findings were reported in 8 (5%) of 150 patients. Most patients harbored germline uncertain variants in cancer genes (98%), pharmacogenetic variants (89%), and recessive carrier mutations (85%).; Conclusions and Relevance: Tumor and germline WES revealed mutations in a broad spectrum of genes previously implicated in both adult and pediatric cancers. Combined reporting of tumor and germline WES identified diagnostic and/or potentially actionable findings in nearly 40% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with solid tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in sinus surgery rates in the US Medicaid population by ethnicities.; STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective administrative database analysis.; SETTING: US-based outpatient settings.; METHODS: All patients from the MarketScan Medicaid database with endoscopic sinus surgery from 2009 to 2013 were stratified by ethnicity, age (5-year increments, as per US Census), and sex. Crude rates of endoscopic sinus surgery per age group and sex were compiled for all patients and each ethnic group (African American, Caucasian, Hispanics, and others). Age and sex standardization was done with the MarketScan Medicaid overall population as standard. The coefficient of variation, extremal ratio, and chi-square statistics were calculated to determine variation across ethnicities.; RESULTS: Overall sinus surgery rates per 1000 people in the Medicaid population ranged from 0.36 to 0.40 from 2009 to 2013 (African Americans: 0.24-0.26; Hispanics: 0.21-0.37; Caucasians: 0.47-0.56; rate of surgery statistically lower for African American vs Hispanics for 4 of 5 years). The coefficient of variation and extremal ratio ranged from 29.3% to 45.6% and 1.98 to 2.6, respectively. Differences among groups were significant for all years (P < .0001). Comparison of sex-adjusted ratios by age group demonstrated greater rates of surgery in the Caucasian group versus other groups for all age categories.; CONCLUSION: The Medicaid database was selected for this analysis to eliminate payer and wealth as potential confounders in access to health care. Despite this approach, significant differences in surgery rates among ethnic groups were observed. Further research is critical to understand those differences and provide actionable and effective recommendations for change. © American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2016.

AB Merkel cell carcinoma is an ultra-rare cutaneous neuroendocrine cancer for which approved treatment options are lacking. To better understand potential actionability, the genomic landscape of Merkel cell cancers was assessed. The molecular aberrations in 17 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma were, on physician request, tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) using next-generation sequencing (182 or 236 genes) and analyzed by N-of-One, Inc. (Lexington, MA). There were 30 genes harboring aberrations and 60 distinct molecular alterations identified in this patient population. The most common abnormalities involved the TP53 gene (12/17 [71% of patients]) and the cell cycle pathway (CDKN2A/B, CDKN2C or RB1) (12/17 [71%]). Abnormalities also were observed in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (AKT2, FBXW7, NF1, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN or RICTOR) (9/17 [53%]) and DNA repair genes (ATM, BAP1, BRCA1/2, CHEK2, FANCA or MLH1) (5/17 [29%]). Possible cognate targeted therapies, including FDA-approved drugs, could be identified in most of the patients (16/17 [94%]). In summary, Merkel cell carcinomas were characterized by multiple distinct aberrations that were unique in the majority of analyzed cases. Most patients had theoretically actionable alterations. These results provide a framework for investigating tailored combinations of matched therapies in Merkel cell carcinoma patients.

AB UNLABELLED: Bloodstream infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early and targeted antimicrobial intervention is lifesaving, yet current diagnostic approaches fail to provide actionable information within a clinically viable time frame due to their reliance on blood culturing. Here, we present a novel pathogen identification (PID) platform that features the use of duplex DNA-invading gamma-modified peptide nucleic acids (gammaPNAs) for the rapid identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from blood, without culturing. The PID platform provides species-level information in under 2.5 hours while reaching single-CFU-per-milliliter sensitivity across the entire 21-pathogen panel. The clinical utility of the PID platform was demonstrated through assessment of 61 clinical specimens, which showed >95% sensitivity and >90% overall correlation to blood culture findings. This rapid gammaPNA-based platform promises to improve patient care by enabling the administration of a targeted first-line antimicrobial intervention.; IMPORTANCE: Bloodstream infections continue to be a major cause of death for hospitalized patients, despite significant improvements in both the availability of treatment options as well their application. Since early and targeted antimicrobial intervention is one of the prime determinants of patient outcome, the rapid identification of the pathogen can be lifesaving. Unfortunately, current diagnostic approaches for identifying these infections all rely on time-consuming blood culture, which precludes immediate intervention with a targeted antimicrobial. To address this, we have developed and characterized a new and comprehensive methodology, from patient specimen to result, for the rapid identification of both bacterial and fungal pathogens without the need for culturing. We anticipate broad interest in our work, given the novelty of our technical approach combined with an immense unmet need. Copyright © 2016 Nolling et al.

AB BACKGROUND: Direct-to-consumer (DTC) personal genomic testing (PGT) allows individuals to learn about their genetic makeup without going through a physician, but some consumers share their results with their primary care provider (PCP).; OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and perceptions of DTC PGT consumers who discuss their results with their PCP.; DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective cohort study.; SETTING: Online survey before and 6 months after results.; PARTICIPANTS: DTC PGT consumers.; MEASUREMENTS: Consumer satisfaction with the DTC PGT experience; whether and, if so, how many results could be used to improve health; how many results were not understood; and beliefs about the PCP's understanding of genetics. Participants were asked with whom they had discussed their results. Genetic reports were linked to survey responses.; RESULTS: Among 1026 respondents, 63% planned to share their results with a PCP. At 6-month follow-up, 27% reported having done so, and 8% reported sharing with another health care provider only. Common reasons for not sharing results with a health care provider were that the results were not important enough (40%) or that the participant did not have time to do so (37%). Among participants who discussed results with their PCP, 35% were very satisfied with the encounter, and 18% were not at all satisfied. Frequently identified themes in participant descriptions of these encounters were actionability of the results or use in care (32%), PCP engagement or interest (25%), and lack of PCP engagement or interest (22%).; LIMITATION: Participants may not be representative of all DTC PGT consumers.; CONCLUSION: A comprehensive picture of DTC PGT consumers who shared their results with a health care provider is presented. The proportion that shares results is expected to increase with time after testing as consumers find opportunities for discussion at later appointments or if results become relevant as medical needs evolve.; PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of Health.

AB Somatic mutation analysis represents a useful tool in selecting personalized therapy. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of common genetic events affecting actionable oncogenes using a MassARRAY technology in patients with advanced solid tumors who were potential candidates for target-based therapies. The analysis of 238 mutations across 19 oncogenes was performed in 197 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of different tumors using the OncoCarta Panel v1.0 (Sequenom Hamburg, Germany). Of the 197 specimens, 97 (49.2%) presented at least one mutation. Forty-nine different oncogenic mutations in 16 genes were detected. Mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA were detected in 40/97 (41.2%) and 30/97 (30.9%) patients respectively. Thirty-one patients (32.0%) had mutations in two genes, 20 of them (64.5%) initially diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The co-occurrence of mutation involved mainly KRAS, PIK3CA, KIT and RET. Mutation profiles were validated using a customized panel and the Junior Next-Generation Sequencing technology (GS-Junior 454, Roche). Twenty-eight patients participated in early clinical trials or received specific treatments according to the molecular characterization (28.0%). MassARRAY technology is a rapid and effective method for identifying key cancer-driving mutations across a large number of samples, which allows for a more appropriate selection for personalized therapies.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of pathogenic inherited mutations in 157 select genes from patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).; DESIGN: Observational.; SETTING: Multisite US-based cohort.; PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-one adult male patients with histological confirmation of prostate cancer, and had progressive disease while on androgen deprivation therapy.; RESULTS: Twelve patients (17.4%) showed evidence of carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in the ATM, ATR, BRCA2, FANCL, MSR1, MUTYH, RB1, TSHR and WRN genes. All but one patient opted in to receive clinically actionable results at the time of study initiation. We also found that pathogenic germline BRCA2 variants appear to be enriched in mCRPC compared to familial prostate cancers.; CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic variants in cancer-susceptibility genes are frequently observed in patients with mCRPC. A substantial proportion of patients with mCRPC or their family members would derive clinical utility from mutation screening.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01953640; Results.

AB Clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors have provided important insights into the mode of action of anticancer immune therapies and potential mechanisms of immune escape. Development of the next wave of rational clinical combination strategies will require a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which combination partners influence the battle between the immune system's capabilities to fight cancer and the immune-suppressive processes that promote tumor growth. This review focuses on our current understanding of tumor and circulating pharmacodynamic correlates of immune modulation and elaborates on lessons learned from human translational research with checkpoint inhibitors. Actionable tumor markers of immune activation including CD8(+)T cells, PD-L1 IHC as a pharmacodynamic marker of T-cell function, T-cell clonality, and challenges with conduct of trials that ask scientific questions from serial biopsies are addressed. Proposals for clinical trial design, as well as future applications of peripheral pharmacodynamic endpoints as potential surrogates of early clinical activity, are discussed. On the basis of emerging mechanisms of response and immune escape, we propose the concept of the tumor immunity continuum as a framework for developing rational combination strategies. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Somatic mutations binding to the patient's MHC and recognized by autologous T cells (neoepitopes) are ideal cancer vaccine targets. They combine a favorable safety profile due to a lack of expression in healthy tissues with a high likelihood of immunogenicity, as T cells recognizing neoepitopes are not shaped by central immune tolerance. Proteins mutated in cancer (neoantigens) shared by patients have been explored as vaccine targets for many years. Shared ("public") mutations, however, are rare, as the vast majority of cancer mutations in a given tumor are unique for the individual patient. Recently, the novel concept of truly individualized cancer vaccination emerged, which exploits the vast source of patient-specific "private" mutations. Concurrence of scientific advances and technological breakthroughs enables the rapid, cost-efficient, and comprehensive mapping of the "mutanome," which is the entirety of somatic mutations in an individual tumor, and the rational selection of neoepitopes. How to transform tumor mutanome data to actionable knowledge for tailoring individualized vaccines "on demand" has become a novel research field with paradigm-shifting potential. This review gives an overview with particular focus on the clinical development of such vaccines. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Intratumoral heterogeneity of signaling networks may contribute to targeted cancer therapy resistance, including in the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM). We performed single-cell phosphoproteomics on a patient-derived in vivo GBM model of mTOR kinase inhibitor resistance and coupled it to an analytical approach for detecting changes in signaling coordination. Alterations in the protein signaling coordination were resolved as early as 2.5 days after treatment, anticipating drug resistance long before it was clinically manifest. Combination therapies were identified that resulted in complete and sustained tumor suppression in vivo. This approach may identify actionable alterations in signal coordination that underlie adaptive resistance, which can be suppressed through combination drug therapy, including non-obvious drug combinations.

AB Because of their ability to induce local immunosuppression and to confer cancer cells with resistance to apoptosis, members of the galectin family are emerging as a new class of actionable targets in cancer. Unfortunately, we have yet to obtain a clear picture of the galectin signatures in cancer cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to provide the first detailed analysis of the galectin signature in molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Expression signatures of galectins were obtained at the mRNA and protein levels. A particular attention was paid to stromal versus epithelial staining and to subcellular compartmentalization. Analysis of the stromal signature showed that gal-1, -3, -9-positive stroma were preferentially found in triple-negative (TN) and HER2 subtypes. In cancer cells, gal-1, -3, -8, and -9 showed a dual expression pattern, being found either in the cytosol or in the cytosol and the nucleus. TN patients with gal-8-positive nuclei had significantly better disease-free survival (DFS), distant-disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS). In contrast, high expression of nuclear gal-1 correlated with poor DDFS and OS. TNBC patients who were positive for both nuclear gal-1 and gal-8 had 5-year DFS and DDFS of 100%, suggesting a dominance of the gal-8 phenotype. Overall, the results indicate that specific galectin expression signatures contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. Our data also suggest that galectins have clinical utility as indicators of disease progression and therapeutic targets in aggressive molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

AB Given all the available knowledge about effective implementation, why do many organizations continue to have-or appear to have-an implementation problem? Analysis of a 7-year corpus of reports by a Canadian health region's "embedded" research and evaluation unit sought to discover the source of the region's intractable difficulty implementing improvement. Findings suggested that the problem was neither a lack of knowledge (decision-makers displayed sophisticated understanding of fundamental issues) nor an inability to take action (there existed sufficient capacity to implement change). However, managers' high-level knowledge was not made actionable, and micro-level decision-making often produced piecemeal actions inadequately informed by existing knowledge. The problem arose at the stage of "operationalization"-the identification of concrete, executable actions fully informed by knowledge of complex, system-level issues. Yet this crucial phase is a focus of neither the implementation nor knowledge translation (KT) literatures. The organizational decision-making literature reveals how decision-makers initiate operationalization (i.e., by setting the direction for a discovery approach) but not how they can ensure its successful completion. The focus of KT research and practice should expand to explicating and improving decision-making, lest KT become an exercise of infusing content into a broken process.

AB Needle fear typically begins in childhood and represents an important health-related issue across the lifespan. Individuals who are highly fearful of needles frequently avoid health care. Although guidance exists for managing needle pain and fear during procedures, the most highly fearful may refuse or abstain from such procedures. The purpose of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) is to provide actionable instruction on the management of a particular health concern; this guidance emerges from a systematic process. Using evidence from a rigorous systematic review interpreted by an expert panel, this CPG provides recommendations on exposure-based interventions for high levels of needle fear in children and adults. The AGREE-II, GRADE, and Cochrane methodologies were used. Exposure-based interventions were included. The included evidence was very low quality on average. Strong recommendations include the following. In vivo (live/in person) exposure-based therapy is recommended (vs. no treatment) for children sevenyears and older and adults with high levels of needle fear. Non-in vivo (imaginal, computer-based) exposure (vs. no treatment) is recommended for individuals (over sevenyears of age) who are unwilling to undergo in vivo exposure. Although there were no included trials which examined children<7years, exposure-based interventions are discussed as good clinical practice. Implementation considerations are discussed and clinical tools are provided. Utilization of these recommended practices may lead to improved health outcomes due to better health care compliance. Research on the understanding and treatment of high levels of needle fear is urgently needed; specific recommendations are provided.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient compliance is a crucial determinant of outcomes in treatments involving medical braces, such as dynamic compression therapy for pectus carinatum (PC). We performed a pilot study to assess a novel, wireless, real-time monitoring system (MyPectus) to address noncompliance.; METHODS: Eight patients (10-16years old) with moderately severe PC deformities underwent bracing. Each patient received a data logger device inserted in the compression brace to sense temperature and pressure. The data were transmitted via Bluetooth 4.0 to an iOS smartphone app, then synced to cloud-based storage, and presented to the clinician on a web-based dashboard. Patients received points for brace usage on the app throughout the 4-week study, and completed a survey to capture patient-reported usage patterns.; RESULTS: In all 8 patients, the data logger sensed and recorded data, which connected through all MyPectus system components. There were occasional lapses in data collection because of technical difficulties, such as limited storage capacity. Patients reported positive feedback regarding points.; CONCLUSIONS: The components of the MyPectus system recorded, stored, and provided data to patients and clinicians. The MyPectus system will inform clinicians about issues related to noncompliance: discrepancy between patient-reported and sensor-reported data regarding brace usage; real-time, actionable information; and patient motivation.

AB Repetition by clinicians of the same tests for a given patient is common. However, not all repeat tests are necessary for optimal care and can result in unnecessary hardship. Limited evidence suggests that an electronic health record may reduce redundant laboratory testing and imaging by making previous results accessible to physicians. The purpose of this study is to establish a baseline by characterizing repeat testing in a pediatric population and to identify significant risk factors associated with repeated tests, including the impact of using multiple health systems. A population-based retrospective cross-sectional design was used to examine initial and repeat test instances, defined as a second test following an initial test of the same type for the same patient. The study population consisted of 8760 children with 1-25 test claims over a 1-year period. The study setting included all health care service organizations in Minnesota that generated these claims. In all, 17.2% of tests met the definition of repeat test instances, with several risk factors associated with per patient repeat test levels. The incidence of repeat test instances per patient was significantly higher when patients received care from more than 1 health system (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.3-1.5). Repeat test levels are significant in pediatric populations and potentially actionable. Interoperable health information technology may reduce the incidence of repeat test instances in pediatric populations by making prior test results readily accessible.

AB The development of targeted therapies based on specific genomic alterations has altered the treatment and management of lung and colorectal cancers. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) has allowed identification of copy number variations (CNVs) in lung and colorectal cancers in great detail, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used extensively to analyze the genome of cancers for molecular subtyping and use of molecularly guided therapies. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of combining CMA and NGS for a comprehensive genomic assessment of lung and colorectal adenocarcinomas, especially for detecting drug targets. We compared the results from NGS and CMA data from 60 lung and 51 colorectal tumors. From CMA analysis, 33% were amplified, 89% showed gains, 75% showed losses and 41% demonstrated loss of heterozygosity; pathogenic variants were identified in 81% of colon and 67% lung specimens through NGS. KRAS mutations commonly occurred with loss in TP53 and there was significant loss of BRCA1 and NF1 among male patients with lung cancer. For clinically actionable targets, 23% had targetable CNVs when no pathogenic variants were detected by NGS. The data thus indicate that combining the two approaches provides significant benefit in a routine clinical setting not available by NGS alone.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to assess multi-gene panel testing in an ethnically diverse clinical cancer genetics practice. We conducted a retrospective study of individuals with a personal or family history of cancer undergoing clinically indicated multi-gene panel tests of 6-110 genes, from six commercial laboratories. The 475 patients in the study included 228 Hispanics (47.6%), 166 non-Hispanic Whites (35.4%), 55 Asians (11.6%), 19 Blacks (4.0%), and seven others (1.5%). Panel testing found that 15.6% (74/475) of patients carried deleterious mutations for a total of 79 mutations identified. This included 7.4% (35/475) of patients who had a mutation identified that would not have been tested with a gene-by-gene approach. The identification of a panel-added mutation impacted clinical management for most of cases (69%, 24/35), and genetic testing was recommended for the first degree relatives of nearly all of them (91%, 32/35). Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) were identified in a higher proportion of tests performed in ethnic minorities. Multi-gene panel testing increases the yield of mutations detected and adds to the capability of providing individualized cancer risk assessment. VUSs represent an interpretive challenge due to less data available outside of White, non-Hispanic populations. Further studies are necessary to expand understanding of the implementation and utilization of panels across broad clinical settings and patient populations.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Comprehensive genetic profiling by massively parallel sequencing, commonly known as next generation sequencing (NGS), is becoming the foundation of personalized oncology. For sarcomas very few targeted treatments are currently in routine use. In clinical practice the preoperative diagnostic workup of soft tissue tumours largely relies on core needle biopsies. Although mostly sufficient for histopathological diagnosis, only very limited amounts of formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissue are often available for predictive mutation analysis. Targeted NGS may thus open up new possibilities for comprehensive characterization of scarce biopsies. We therefore set out to search for driver mutations by NGS in a cohort of 55 clinically and morphologically well characterized sarcomas using low input of DNA from formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissues. The aim was to investigate if there are any recurrent or targetable aberrations in cancer driver genes in addition to known chromosome translocations in different types of sarcomas. We employed a panel covering 207 mutation hotspots in 50 cancer-associated genes to analyse DNA from nine gastrointestinal stromal tumours, 14 synovial sarcomas, seven myxoid liposarcomas, 22 Ewing sarcomas and three Ewing-like small round cell tumours at a large sequencing depth to detect also mutations that are subclonal or occur at low allele frequencies. We found nine mutations in eight different potential driver genes, some of which are potentially actionable by currently existing targeted therapies. Even though no recurrent mutations in driver genes were found in the different sarcoma groups, we show that targeted NGS-based sequencing is clearly feasible in a diagnostic setting with very limited amounts of paraffin embedded tissue and may provide novel insights into mesenchymal cell signalling and potentially druggable targets. Interestingly, we also identify five non-synonymous sequence variants in 4 established cancer driver genes in DNA from normal tissue from sarcoma patients that may possibly predispose or contribute to neoplastic development.

AB The constitutive anabolism of cancer cells not only supports proliferation but also addicts tumor cells to a steady influx of exogenous nutrients. Limiting access to metabolic substrates could be an effective and selective means to block cancer growth. In this review, we define the pathways by which cancer cells acquire the raw materials for anabolism, highlight the actionable proteins in each pathway, and discuss the status of therapeutic interventions that disrupt nutrient acquisition. Critical open questions to be answered before apical metabolic inhibitors can be successfully and safely deployed in the clinic are also outlined. In summary, recent studies provide strong support that substrate limitation is a powerful therapeutic strategy to effectively, and safely, starve cancer cells to death.  © 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

AB OBJECTIVES: Increased adoption of electronic health records has resulted in increased availability of free text clinical data for secondary use. A variety of approaches to obtain actionable information from unstructured free text data exist. These approaches are resource intensive, inherently complex and rely on structured clinical data and dictionary-based approaches. We sought to evaluate the potential to obtain actionable information from free text pathology reports using routinely available tools and approaches that do not depend on dictionary-based approaches.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained pathology reports from a large health information exchange and evaluated the capacity to detect cancer cases from these reports using 3 non-dictionary feature selection approaches, 4 feature subset sizes, and 5 clinical decision models: simple logistic regression, naive bayes, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and J48 decision tree. The performance of each decision model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.; RESULTS: Decision models parameterized using automated, informed, and manual feature selection approaches yielded similar results. Furthermore, non-dictionary classification approaches identified cancer cases present in free text reports with evaluation measures approaching and exceeding 80-90% for most metrics.; CONCLUSION: Our methods are feasible and practical approaches for extracting substantial information value from free text medical data, and the results suggest that these methods can perform on par, if not better, than existing dictionary-based approaches. Given that public health agencies are often under-resourced and lack the technical capacity for more complex methodologies, these results represent potentially significant value to the public health field.

AB PURPOSE: Patient care within radiation oncology extends beyond the clinic or treatment hours. The on-call radiation oncologist is often not a patient's primary radiation oncologist, introducing the possibility of communication breakdowns and medical errors. This study analyzed after-hours telephone calls to identify opportunities for improved patient safety and quality of care.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient calls received outside of business hours between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014, at two academic radiation oncology departments were retrospectively reviewed. All calls were analyzed using content analysis, and descriptive analyses were performed.; RESULTS: During this time, 5,557 courses of radiotherapy (RT) were delivered. A total of 454 calls were received from 369 unique patients (81%), averaging 4.4 calls per week per department. Phone encounters were documented for 223 calls (49%). The calls were categorized by disease site (No., %): central nervous system (91, 20%), head and neck (78, 17%), genitourinary (53, 12%), GI (52, 12%), thoracic (51, 11%), gynecologic (30, 7%), breast (24, 5%), and other (75, 17%). Patients most often called regarding acute medical, non-RT-related issues (144 calls, 32%); acute RT-related adverse effects (127, 28%); and medication management, including refills (63, 14%).; CONCLUSION: This analysis provided novel information regarding the volume of and reasons for after-hours patient-initiated telephone calls. It identified opportunities for actionable improvements in safety and quality of care, particularly with regard to documentation by on-call providers, communication with the primary radiation oncology and extended health care teams, patient education about common RT adverse effects, and medication management.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of biomarkers for prostate cancer screening, diagnosis and prognosis has the potential to improve the clinical management of the patients. Owing to inherent limitations of the biomarker prostate-specific antigen (PSA), intensive efforts are currently directed towards a search for alternativeprostate cancer biomarkers, particularly those that can predict disease aggressiveness and drive better treatment decisions.; METHODS: A literature search of Medline articles focused on recent and emerging advances in prostate cancer biomarkers was performed. The most promising biomarkers that have the potential to meet the unmet clinical needs inprostate cancer patient management and/orthat are clinically implemented wereselected.; CONCLUSIONS: With the advent of advanced genomic and proteomic technologies, we have in recent years seen an enormous spurt in prostate cancer biomarker research with several promising alternative biomarkers being discovered that show an improved sensitivity and specificity over PSA. The new generation of biomarkers can be tested via serum, urine, or tissue-based assays that have either received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration or are available as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-based laboratory developed tests. Additional emerging novel biomarkers for prostate cancer, including circulating tumor cells, microRNAs and exosomes, are still in their infancy. Together, these biomarkers provide actionable guidanceforprostate cancer risk assessment, and are expected to lead to an era of personalized medicine.

AB Little is known about how real-time online rating platforms such as Yelp may complement the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, which is the US standard for evaluating patients' experiences after hospitalization. We compared the content of Yelp narrative reviews of hospitals to the topics in the HCAHPS survey, called domains in HCAHPS terminology. While the domains included in Yelp reviews covered the majority of HCAHPS domains, Yelp reviews covered an additional twelve domains not found in HCAHPS. The majority of Yelp topics that most strongly correlate with positive or negative reviews are not measured or reported by HCAHPS. The large collection of patient- and caregiver-centered experiences found on Yelp can be analyzed with natural language processing methods, identifying for policy makers the measures of hospital quality that matter most to patients and caregivers. The Yelp measures and analysis can also provide actionable feedback for hospitals.  Project HOPEThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.

AB Activating BRAF mutations, in particular V600E/K, drive many cancers and are considered mutually exclusive with mutant RAS, whereas inactivating BRAF mutations in the D(594)F(595)G(596) motif cooperate with RAS via paradoxical MEK/ERK activation. Due to the increasing use of comprehensive tumor genomic profiling, many non-V600 BRAF mutations are being detected whose functional consequences and therapeutic actionability are often unknown. We investigated an atypical BRAF mutation, F595L, which was identified along with mutant HRAS in histiocytic sarcoma and also occurs in epithelial cancers, melanoma and neuroblastoma, and determined its interaction with mutant RAS. Unlike other DFG motif mutants, BRAF(F595L) is a gain-of-function variant with intermediate activity that does not act paradoxically, but nevertheless cooperates with mutant RAS to promote oncogenic signaling, which is efficiently blocked by pan-RAF and MEK inhibitors. Mutation data from patients and cell lines show that BRAF(F595L), as well as other intermediate-activity BRAF mutations, frequently coincide with mutant RAS in various cancers. These data define a distinct class of activating BRAF mutations, extend the spectrum of patients with systemic histiocytoses and other malignancies who are candidates for therapeutic blockade of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and underscore the value of comprehensive genomic testing for uncovering the vulnerabilities of individual tumors.

AB Disturbed sleep is one of the most common complaints following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and worsens morbidity and long-term sequelae. Further, sleep and TBI share neurophysiologic underpinnings with direct relevance to recovery from TBI. As such, disturbed sleep and clinical sleep disorders represent modifiable treatment targets to improve outcomes in TBI. This paper presents key findings from a national working group on sleep and TBI, with a specific focus on the testing and development of sleep-related therapeutic interventions for mild TBI (mTBI). First, mTBI and sleep physiology are briefly reviewed. Next, essential empirical and clinical questions and knowledge gaps are addressed. Finally, actionable recommendations are offered to guide active and efficient collaboration between academic, industry, and governmental stakeholders.

AB Patient monitoring generates a large number of alarms, the vast majority of which are false. Excessive non-actionable medical alarms lead to alarm fatigue, a well-recognized patient safety issue. While multiple approaches to reduce alarm fatigue have been explored, patterns in alarming and inter-alarm relationships, as they manifest in the clinical workspace, are largely a black-box and hamper research efforts towards reducing alarms. The aim of this study is to detect opportunities to safely reduce alarm pressure, by developing techniques to identify, capture and visualize patterns in alarms. Nearly 500000 critical medical alarms were acquired from a neonatal intensive care unit over a 20 month period. Heuristic techniques were developed to extract the inter-alarm relationships. These included identifying the presence of alarm clusters, patterns of transition from one alarm category to another, temporal associations amongst alarms and determination of prevalent sequences in which alarms manifest. Desaturation, bradycardia and apnea constituted 86% of all alarms and demonstrated distinctive periodic increases in the number of alarms that were synchronized with nursing care and enteral feeding. By inhibiting further alarms of a category for a short duration of time (30s/60s), non-actionable physiological alarms could be reduced by 20%. The patterns of transition from one alarm category to another and the time duration between such transitions revealed the presence of close temporal associations and multiparametric derangement. Examination of the prevalent alarm sequences reveals that while many sequences comprised of multiple alarms, nearly 65% of the sequences were isolated instances of alarms and are potentially irreducible. Patterns in alarming, as they manifest in the clinical workspace were identified and visualized. This information can be exploited to investigate strategies for reducing alarms.

AB OBJECTIVE: In an effort to better incorporate precision medicine into clinical practice, we initiated a pilot project to screen, discuss, and genetically characterize patients with metastatic or recurrent gynecologic malignancies for whom no curative standard of care exists.; METHODS: In 7/2014, we initiated a multi-disciplinary Precision Medicine Board (PMB) whose purpose was to apply molecular profiling to select and prioritize early phase clinical trial enrollment for high-risk gynecologic malignancies. Additional objectives were to record outcomes and enable scientific discussions of mutations which may foster local translational research. FoundationOne was the preferred genomic platform; results were reviewed by a team comprised of disease site specialists, phase I trialists, and basic and translational scientists affiliated with the Gynecologic Cancer Program. A detailed database for each patient was created and is followed prospectively for treatment use and resultant outcomes.; RESULTS: To date, we have presented 62 cases with interpretable FoundationOne testing on 60 tumor samples (31 ovarian, 18 uterine, 9 cervical, and 4 other female genital tract). Significant genomic alterations were commonly found in all tumor types (median: 3); TP53 (45%) and PIK3CA (27%) were the most frequently noted mutations; however, molecular profiling resulted in identification of few actionable mutations (6%). To date, we have matched 4 patients on therapies based on actionable mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: The predominant function of our PMB is establishment of a forum to enhance research while providing clinical care for refractory malignancies. We have matched patients with specific mutations to ongoing trials and are developing investigator-initiated studies based on trends within genomic profiling results. Longer-term follow up will be required to determine the success of this strategy. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of the role of palliative care (PC) in health care delivery, but priorities for state and federal policy to support PC are unclear and have sometimes engendered controversy. We canvassed experts to shed light on general recommendations for improving PC.; OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to identify challenges to and potential solutions for promoting, adopting, and implementing policies that would support or expand high-quality PC.; METHODS: Semistructured telephone interviews were used to solicit challenges to and potential solutions for promoting, adopting, and implementing policies that would support or expand high-quality PC. Interviews were analyzed using qualitative methods. The subjects were a purposive sample of 22 professional state and federal-level advocates who work in the field of aging and/or PC.; RESULTS: Respondents identified four central challenges to advancing PC policies: (1) knowledge about PC in the health care setting, (2) cultural beliefs about PC, (3) payment/reimbursement for PC services, and (4) public understanding of PC. Of the wide range of solutions proposed by respondents, we present the eight most frequently discussed solutions to these challenges targeted towards policymakers, health care professionals, research, and the general public. Respondents' understanding of the relationships between problems and solutions revealed many dependencies and interconnectedness.; CONCLUSIONS: A qualitative approach of querying experts identified multiple significant challenges to improving and expanding PC, most of which are acknowledged in existing consensus statements. Proposed solutions were more numerous and diffuse than descriptions of the problems, signaling the need for further consensus building around actionable policy, and better understanding of how to advance a PC policy agenda.

AB Despite many technological and computational advances, the results of a mass spectrometry proteomics experiment are still subject to a large variability. For the understanding and evaluation of how technical variability affects the results of an experiment, several computationally derived quality control metrics have been introduced. However, despite the availability of these metrics, a systematic approach to quality control is often still lacking because the metrics are not fully understood and are hard to interpret. Here, we present a toolkit of powerful techniques to analyze and interpret multivariate quality control metrics to assess the quality of mass spectrometry proteomics experiments. We show how unsupervised techniques applied to these quality control metrics can provide an initial discrimination between low-quality experiments and high-quality experiments prior to manual investigation. Furthermore, we provide a technique to obtain detailed information on the quality control metrics that are related to the decreased performance, which can be used as actionable information to improve the experimental setup. Our toolkit is released as open-source and can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/proteinspector/qc_analysis/ .

AB BACKGROUND: Appendiceal cancer (AC) patients treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) often demonstrate an unpredictable variability in their survival outcomes. Biomarkers predictive of CRS/HIPEC efficacy could better guide treatment decisions. We hypothesized that variation in the transcriptional programming of AC tumors might distinguish molecular subtypes with differential outcomes after CRS/HIPEC.; STUDY DESIGN: Gene expression profiles of 2 AC cohorts were analyzed using Affymetrix whole-genome expression microarrays. Hierarchical clustering methods, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression models were used to discover and validate prognostic molecular subtypes of AC. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to infer pathologic attributes of the molecular subtypes.; RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of tumor expression profiles revealed a 139-gene cassette that distinguished 2 molecular subtypes (based on low vs high expression of the gene cassette) with statistically significant survival differences (disease-specific survival, p= 0.0075; progression-free survival, p= 0.0072). In a second AC cohort, the 139-gene cassette reproducibly partitioned tumors into subtypes with significant survival differences. Tumors showing high relative expression of the genes comprising the cassette associated with poor survival outcomes (disease-specific survival, p= 0.047; progression-free survival, p= 0.0079), and exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for oncogenic processes and pathways. The prognostic value of the molecular subtypes was specific for low-grade appendiceal tumors (disease-specific survival, p= 0.028; progression-free survival, p= 0.0016), and remained significant in the presence of conventional prognostic markers, including grade, surgical resection score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, and age.; CONCLUSIONS: The 139-gene cassette can have actionable clinical utility for identifying low-grade appendiceal tumor molecular subtypes predictive of therapeutic efficacy of CRS/HIPEC.

AB The identification of recurrent driver mutations by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of fresh-frozen human cancers and the subsequent development of novel targeted therapies have recently transformed the treatment of many cancers including melanoma. In routine clinical practice, fresh-frozen tissue is rarely available and mutation testing usually needs to be carried out on archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, from which DNA is typically fragmented, cross-linked and of lower quality. In this study we aimed to determine whether WES data generated from genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from FFPE tissues can be produced reliably and of clinically-actionable standard. In this study of ten melanoma patients, we compared WES data produced from analysis of gDNA isolated from FFPE tumour tissue with that isolated from fresh-frozen tumour tissue from the same specimen. FFPE samples were sequenced using both Illumina's Nextera and NimbleGen SeqCap exome capture kits. To examine mutations between the two tissue sources and platforms, somatic mutations in the FFPE exomes were called using the matched fresh tissue sequence as a reference. Of the 10 FFPE DNA samples, seven Nextera and four SeqCap samples passed library preparation. On average, there were 5341 and 2246 variants lost in FFPE compared to matched fresh tissue utilising Nextera and SeqCap kits, respectively. In order to explore the feasibility of future clinical implementation of WES, FFPE variants in 27 genes of important clinical relevance in melanoma were assessed. The average concordance rate was 43.2% over a total of 1299 calls for the chosen genes in the FFPE DNA. For the current clinically most important melanoma mutations, 0/3 BRAF and 6/8 (75%) NRAS FFPE calls were concordant with the fresh tissue result, which was confirmed using a Sequenom OncoCarta Panel. The poor performance of FFPE WES indicates that specialised library construction to account for low quality DNA and further refinements will be necessary before this approach could be used for routine clinical decision making over currently preferred techniques.

AB A national collaborative helped many hospitals dramatically reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), but some hospitals struggled to reduce infection rates. This article describes the development of a peer-to-peer assessment process (CLABSI Conversations) and the practical, actionable practices we discovered that helped intensive care unit teams achieve a CLABSI rate of less than 1 infection per 1000 catheter-days for at least 1 year. CLABSI Conversations was designed as a learning-oriented process, in which a team of peers visited hospitals to surface barriers to infection prevention and to share best practices and insights from successful intensive care units. Common practices led to 10 recommendations: executive and board leaders communicate the goal of zero CLABSI throughout the hospital; senior and unit-level leaders hold themselves accountable for CLABSI rates; unit physicians and nurse leaders own the problem; clinical leaders and infection preventionists build infection prevention training and simulation programs; infection preventionists participate in unit-based CLABSI reduction efforts; hospital managers make compliance with best practices easy; clinical leaders standardize the hospital's catheter insertion and maintenance practices and empower nurses to stop any potentially harmful acts; unit leaders and infection preventionists investigate CLABSIs to identify root causes; and unit nurses and staff audit catheter maintenance policies and practices.

AB 3q29 deletion syndrome is caused by a recurrent, typically de novo heterozygous 1.6 Mb deletion, but because incidence of the deletion is rare (1 in 30,000 births) the phenotype is not well described. To characterize the range of phenotypic manifestations associated with 3q29 deletion syndrome, we have developed an online registry (3q29deletion.org) for ascertainment of study subjects and phenotypic data collection via Internet-based survey instruments. We report here on data collected during the first 18 months of registry operation, from 44 patients. This is the largest cohort of 3q29 deletion carriers ever assembled and surveyed in a systematic way. Our data reveal that 28% of registry participants report neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety disorder, panic attacks, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Other novel findings include a high prevalence (64%) of feeding problems in infancy and reduced weight at birth for 3q29 deletion carriers (average reduction 13.9 oz (394g), adjusted for gestational age and sex, P=6.5e-07). We further report on the frequency of heart defects, autism, recurrent ear infections, gastrointestinal phenotypes, and dental phenotypes, among others. We also report on the expected timing of delayed developmental milestones. This is the most comprehensive description of the 3q29 deletion phenotype to date. These results are clinically actionable toward improving patient care for 3q29 deletion carriers, and can guide the expectations of physicians and parents. These data also demonstrate the value of patient-reported outcomes to reveal the full phenotypic spectrum of rare genomic disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: The ability to perform comprehensive profiling of cancers at high resolution is essential for precision medicine. Liquid biopsies using shed exosomes provide high-quality nucleic acids to obtain molecular characterization, which may be especially useful for visceral cancers that are not amenable to routine biopsies.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We isolated shed exosomes in biofluids from three patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers (two pancreatic, one ampullary). We performed comprehensive profiling of exoDNA and exoRNA by whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. We assessed the feasibility of calling copy number events, detecting mutational signatures and identifying potentially actionable mutations in exoDNA sequencing data, as well as expressed point mutations and gene fusions in exoRNA sequencing data.; RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing resulted in 95%-99% of the target regions covered at a mean depth of 133-490*. Genome-wide copy number profiles, and high estimates of tumor fractions (ranging from 56% to 82%), suggest robust representation of the tumor DNA within the shed exosomal compartment. Multiple actionable mutations, including alterations in NOTCH1 and BRCA2, were found in patient exoDNA samples. Further, RNA sequencing of shed exosomes identified the presence of expressed fusion genes, representing an avenue for elucidation of tumor neoantigens.; CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated high-resolution profiling of the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of visceral cancers. A wide range of cancer-derived biomarkers could be detected within the nucleic acid cargo of shed exosomes, including copy number profiles, point mutations, insertions, deletions, gene fusions and mutational signatures. Liquid biopsies using shed exosomes has the potential to be used as a clinical tool for cancer diagnosis, therapeutic stratification and treatment monitoring, precluding the need for direct tumor sampling. © The Author 2015.

AB Gastric cancer is a common disease with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Many gastric cancers harbour potentially actionable targets, including over-expression and mutations in tyrosine kinase pathways. Agents have been developed against these targets with varying success- in particular, the use of trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing gastric cancers has resulted in overall survival benefits. Gastric cancers also have high levels of somatic mutations, making them candidates for immunotherapy; early work in this field has been promising. Recent advances in whole genome and multi-platform sequencing have driven the development of molecular classification systems, which may in turn guide the selection of patients for targeted treatment. Moving forward, challenges will include the development of appropriate biomarkers to predict responses to targeted therapy, and the application of new molecular classifications into trial development and clinical practice.

AB Epigenetic dysregulation is an important emerging hallmark of cutaneous melanoma development. The global loss of DNA methylation in gene-poor regions and transposable DNA elements of cancer cells contributes to increased genomic instability. Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) sequences are the most abundant repetitive sequence of the genome and can be evaluated as a surrogate marker of the global level of DNA methylation. In this work, LINE-1 methylation levels were evaluated in cutaneous melanomas and normal melanocyte primary cell cultures to investigate their possible association with both distinct clinicopathological characteristics and tumor mutational profile. A set of driver mutations frequently identified in cutaneous melanoma was assessed by sequencing (actionable mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes, and mutations affecting the TER T promoter) or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) (CDKN2A deletions). Pyrosequencing was performed to investigate the methylation level of LINE-1 and CDKN2A promoter sequences. The qualitative analysis showed a trend toward an association between LINE-1 hypomethylation and CDKN2A inactivation (p=0.05). In a quantitative approach, primary tumors, mainly the thicker ones (>4 mm), exhibited a trend toward LINE-1 hypomethylation when compared with control melanocytes. To date, this is the first study reporting in cutaneous melanomas a possible link between the dysregulation of LINE-1 methylation and the presence of driver mutations.

AB Since our proposal of a dualistic model of epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis more than a decade ago, a large number of molecular and histopathologic studies were published that have provided important insights into the origin and molecular pathogenesis of this disease. This has required that the original model be revised and expanded to incorporate these findings. The new model divides type I tumors into three groups: i)endometriosis-related tumors that include endometrioid, clear cell, and seromucinous carcinomas; ii) low-grade serous carcinomas; and iii) mucinous carcinomas and malignant Brenner tumors. As in the previous model, type II tumors are composed, for the most part, of high-grade serous carcinomas that can be further subdivided into morphologic and molecular subtypes. Type I tumors develop from benign extraovarian lesions that implant on the ovary and which can subsequently undergo malignant transformation, whereas many type II carcinomas develop from intraepithelial carcinomas in the fallopian tube and, as a result, disseminate as carcinomas that involve the ovary and extraovarian sites, which probably accounts for their clinically aggressive behavior. The new molecular genetic data, especially those derived from next-generation sequencing, further underline the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer and identify actionable mutations. The dualistic model highlights these differences between type I and type II tumors which, it can be argued, describe entirely different groups of diseases.

AB Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a unique and biologically fascinating group of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however it is highly aggressive with poor overall survival compared to other types of NSCLC. Radical surgery remains the standard of care for early localized disease but this has shown to result in high recurrence rates. Traditional palliative chemotherapy is associated with poor response in advanced/metastatic PSC. Recent comprehensive genetic studies and clinical observations are starting to elucidate the key oncogenic underpinnings of PSC. In particular, the recent identification of frequent genetic alterations of the MET gene leading to exon 14 skipping have yielded actionable targets for intervention with available MET inhibitors for a subset of PSC patients. Immunotherapy against immune checkpoints, such as anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents, have also raised great interest for the management of PSC. A growing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of PSC is rapidly yielding novel approaches for the treatment of this deadly malignancy.

AB Precision oncology is now the evidence-based standard of care for the management of many advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Expert consensus has defined minimum requirements for routine testing and identification of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations (15% of tumors harbor EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements (5% of tumors) in advanced lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib). Evolving genomic events in which TKI responses have been reported in smaller series include MET exon 14 skipping mutations (2-4% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); high-level MET amplification (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); RET rearrangements (1% of tumors, drug: cabozantinib); and ERBB2 mutations (2-3% of tumors, drug: afatinib), among others. Unfortunately, the most common genomic event in NSCLC, KRAS mutations (25-30% of tumors), is not targetable with approved or in development small molecule inhibitors. Here, we review currently approved, emerging, and evolving systemic precision therapies matched with their driver oncogenes for the management of advanced NSCLC.  © The Author(s), 2015.

AB The diagnosis, classification, and management of cancer are traditionally dictated by the site of tumor origin, for example, breast or lung, and by specific histologic subtypes of site-of-origin cancers (e.g., non-small cell versus small cell lung cancer). However, with the advent of sequencing technologies allowing for rapid, low cost, and accurate sequencing of clinical samples, new observations suggest an expanded or different approach to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer-one driven by the unique molecular features of the tumor. We discuss a genomically driven strategy for cancer treatment using BRAF as an example. Several key points are highlighted: (i) molecular aberrations can be shared across cancers; (ii) approximately 15% of all cancers harbor BRAF mutations; and (iii) BRAF inhibitors, while approved only for melanoma, have reported activity across numerous cancers and related disease types bearing BRAF aberrations. However, BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer has shown poor response rate to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy, striking a cautionary note. Yet, even in this case, emerging data suggest BRAF-mutated colorectal cancers can respond well to BRAF inhibitors, albeit when administered in combination with other agents that impact resistance pathways. Taken together, these data suggest that molecular aberrations may be the basis for a new nosology for cancer.

AB Activated ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases, resulting from chromosomal rearrangements, occur in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as well as other tumor types and their oncogenic relevance as actionable targets has been demonstrated by the efficacy of selective kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib. More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

AB N-of-1 trials target actionable mutations, yet such approaches do not test genomically-informed therapies in patient tumor models prior to patient treatment. To address this, we developed patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies (FNA-PDX) obtained from primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at the time of diagnosis. Here, we characterize PDX models established from one primary and two metastatic sites of one patient. We identified an activating KRAS G12R mutation among other mutations in these models. In explant cells derived from these PDX tumor models with a KRAS G12R mutation, treatment with inhibitors of CDKs (including CDK9) reduced phosphorylation of a marker of CDK9 activity (phospho-RNAPII CTD Ser2/5) and reduced viability/growth of explant cells derived from PDAC PDX models. Similarly, a CDK inhibitor reduced phospho-RNAPII CTD Ser2/5, increased apoptosis, and inhibited tumor growth in FNA-PDX and patient-matched metastatic-PDX models. In summary, PDX models can be constructed from FNA biopsies of PDAC which in turn can enable genomic characterization and identification of potential therapies.

AB High-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with pattern recognition techniques is an established tool to perform comprehensive metabolite profiling of biological datasets. This paves the way for new, powerful and innovative diagnostic approaches in the post-genomic era and molecular medicine. However, interpreting untargeted metabolomic data requires robust, reproducible and reliable analytical methods to translate results into biologically relevant and actionable knowledge. The analyses of biological samples were developed based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to ion mobility - mass spectrometry (IM-MS). A strategy for optimizing the analytical conditions for untargeted UHPLC-IM-MS methods is proposed using an experimental design approach. Optimization experiments were conducted through a screening process designed to identify the factors that have significant effects on the selected responses (total number of peaks and number of reliable peaks). For this purpose, full and fractional factorial designs were used while partial least squares regression was used for experimental design modeling and optimization of parameter values. The total number of peaks yielded the best predictive model and is used for optimization of parameters setting.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Calcium binding and dissociation within the cardiac thin filament (CTF) is a fundamental regulator of normal contraction and relaxation. Although the disruption of this complex, allosterically mediated process has long been implicated in human disease, the precise atomic-level mechanisms remain opaque, greatly hampering the development of novel targeted therapies. To address this question, we used a fully atomistic CTF model to test both Ca(2+) binding strength and the energy required to remove Ca(2+) from the N-lobe binding site in WT and mutant troponin complexes that have been linked to genetic cardiomyopathies. This computational approach is combined with measurements of in vitro Ca(2+) dissociation rates in fully reconstituted WT and cardiac troponin T R92L and R92W thin filaments. These human disease mutations represent known substitutions at the same residue, reside at a significant distance from the calcium binding site in cardiac troponin C, and do not affect either the binding pocket affinity or EF-hand structure of the binding domain. Both have been shown to have significantly different effects on cardiac function in vivo. We now show that these mutations independently alter the interaction between the Ca(2+) ion and cardiac troponin I subunit. This interaction is a previously unidentified mechanism, in which mutations in one protein of a complex indirectly affect a third via structural and dynamic changes in a second to yield a pathogenic change in thin filament function that results in mutation-specific disease states. We can now provide atom-level insight that is potentially highly actionable in drug design.

AB The FGFs/FGFRs system is a recognized actionable target for therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. We previously identified a non-peptidic compound (SM27) that retains the structural and functional properties of the FGF2-binding sequence of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a major endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. Here we identified new small molecule inhibitors of FGF2 based on the initial lead. A similarity-based screening of small molecule libraries, followed by docking calculations and experimental studies, allowed selecting 7 bi-naphthalenic compounds that bound FGF2 inhibiting its binding to both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and FGFR-1. The compounds inhibit FGF2 activity in in vitro and ex vivo models of angiogenesis, with improved potency over SM27. Comparative analysis of the selected hits, complemented by NMR and biochemical analysis of 4 newly synthesized functionalized phenylamino-substituted naphthalenes, allowed identifying the minimal stereochemical requirements to improve the design of naphthalene sulfonates as FGF2 inhibitors.

AB We optimized and evaluated dynamic myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) imaging on a prototype spectral detector CT (SDCT) scanner. Simultaneous acquisition of energy sensitive projections on the SDCT system enabled projection-based material decomposition, which typically performs better than image-based decomposition required by some other system designs. In addition to virtual monoenergetic, or keV images, the SDCT provided conventional (kVp) images, allowing us to compare and contrast results. Physical phantom measurements demonstrated linearity of keV images, a requirement for quantitative perfusion. Comparisons of kVp to keV images demonstrated very significant reductions in tell-tale beam hardening (BH) artifacts in both phantom and pig images. In phantom images, consideration of iodine contrast to noise ratio and small residual BH artifacts suggested optimum processing at 70 keV. The processing pipeline for dynamic CTP measurements included 4D image registration, spatio-temporal noise filtering, and model-independent singular value decomposition deconvolution, automatically regularized using the L-curve criterion. In normal pig CTP, 70 keV perfusion estimates were homogeneous throughout the myocardium. At 120 kVp, flow was reduced by more than 20% on the BH-hypo-enhanced myocardium, a range that might falsely indicate actionable ischemia, considering the 0.8 threshold for actionable FFR. With partial occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (FFR < 0.8), perfusion defects at 70 keV were correctly identified in the LAD territory. At 120 kVp, BH affected the size and flow in the ischemic area; e.g. with FFR  0.65, the anterior-to-lateral flow ratio was 0.29 ± 0.01, over-estimating stenosis severity as compared to 0.42 ± 0.01 (p < 0.05) at 70 keV. On the non-ischemic inferior wall (not a LAD territory), the flow ratio was 0.50 ± 0.04 falsely indicating an actionable ischemic condition in a healthy territory. This ratio was 1.00 ± 0.08 at 70 keV. Results suggest that projection-based keV imaging with the SDCT system and proper processing could enable useful myocardial CTP, much improved over conventional CT.

AB BACKGROUND: Several studies of smoking cessation programs in clinical settings have revealed poorer outcomes for women compared to men, including counselling alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy. The objective of the current study was to explore treatment and program structure needs and preferences among female clients in a specialized smoking cessation clinic in an academic mental health and addiction health science centre in order to inform program design so that it meets the needs of female clients.; METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with current and former female clients (n = 23, mode age range = 50-59 years old, 56.5% were still smoking and 43.5% had quit) who had registered for outpatient smoking cessation treatment. Questions were designed to examine what aspects of the services were helpful and what changes they would like to see to better assist them and other women with quitting smoking. A thematic analysis of the raw data (audio recordings and notes taken during the focus groups) was conducted using a phenomenological theoretical framework.; RESULTS: Themes that emerged indicated that females trying to quit smoking are best supported if they have choice from a variety of services so that treatment can be individualized to meet their specific needs; psychosocial support is provided both one-one-one with health care professionals and by peers in support groups; free pharmacotherapy is available to eliminate financial barriers to use; women-specific educational topics and support groups are offered; the clinic is accessible with evening/weekend hours, options to attend a local clinic, and childcare availability; and communication about clinic services and operation are clear, readily available, and regularly updated.; CONCLUSIONS: An ideal smoking cessation program for women includes a women's centred approach with sufficient variety and choice, free pharmacotherapy, non-judgmental support, accessible services and clear communication of program options and changes. Findings may suggest an actionable list of adaptations that can be adopted by other clinics providing smoking cessation services to women.

AB PURPOSE: To further understand the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) and develop new therapeutic strategies in this treatment-refractory disease.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing in a discovery set (n = 10) as well as targeted MET mutation screening in an independent validation set (n = 26) of PSC were performed. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to validate MET exon 14 skipping. Functional studies for validation of the oncogenic roles of MET exon 14 skipping were conducted in lung adenosquamous cell line H596 (MET exon 14 skipped and PIK3CA mutated) and gastric adenocarcinoma cell line Hs746T (MET exon 14 skipped). Response to MET inhibitor therapy with crizotinib in a patient with advanced PSC and MET exon 14 skipping was evaluated to assess clinical translatability.; RESULTS: In addition to confirming mutations in known cancer-associated genes (TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, MET, NOTCH, STK11, and RB1), several novel mutations in additional genes, including RASA1, CDH4, CDH7, LAMB4, SCAF1, and LMTK2, were identified and validated. MET mutations leading to exon 14 skipping were identified in eight (22%) of 36 patient cases; one of these tumors also harbored a concurrent PIK3CA mutation. Short interfering RNA silencing of MET and MET inhibition with crizotinib showed marked effects on cell viability and decrease in downstream AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in Hs746T and H596 cells. Concurrent PIK3CA mutation required addition of a second agent for successful pathway suppression and cell viability effect. Dramatic response to crizotinib was noted in a patient with advanced chemotherapy-refractory PSC carrying a MET exon 14 skipping mutation.; CONCLUSION: Mutational events of MET leading to exon 14 skipping are frequent and potentially targetable events in PSC. © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB Human genome and exome sequencing are powerful research tools that can generate secondary findings beyond the scope of the research. Most secondary genomic findings are of low importance, but some (for a current estimate of 1%-3% of individuals) confer high risk of a serious disease that could be mitigated by timely medical intervention. The impact and scope of secondary findings in genome and exome sequencing will only increase in the future. There is considerable agreement that high-impact findings should be returned to participants, but many researchers performing genomic research studies do not have the background, skills, or resources to identify, verify, interpret, and return such variants. Here, we introduce a proposal for the formation of a secondary-genomic-findings service (SGFS) that would support researchers by enabling the return of clinically actionable sequencing results to research participants in a standardized manner. We describe a proposed structure for such a centralized service and evaluate the advantages and challenges of the approach. We suggest that such a service would be of greater benefit to all parties involved than present practice, which is highly variable. We encourage research centers to consider the adoption of a centralized SGFS. Copyright © 2016 The American Society of Human Genetics. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular profiling of lung cancer has become essential for prediction of an individual's response to targeted therapies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a promising technique for routine diagnostics, but has not been sufficiently evaluated in terms of feasibility, reliability, cost and capacity with routine diagnostic formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials. Here, we report the validation and application of a test based on Ion Proton technology for the rapid characterisation of single nucleotide variations (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (InDels), copy number variations (CNVs), and gene rearrangements in 145 genes with FFPE clinical specimens. The validation study, using 61 previously profiled clinical tumour samples, showed a concordance rate of 100% between results obtained by NGS and conventional test platforms. Analysis of tumour cell lines indicated reliable mutation detection in samples with 5% tumour content. Furthermore, application of the panel to 58 clinical cases, identified at least one actionable mutation in 43 cases, 1.4 times the number of actionable alterations detected by current diagnostic tests. We demonstrated that targeted NGS is a cost-effective and rapid platform to detect multiple mutations simultaneously in various genes with high reproducibility and sensitivity.

AB BACKGROUND: Cancer is the third leading cause of mortality in Kenya, accounting for 7% of annual deaths. The Kenyan Ministry of Health (MOH) is committed to reducing cancer mortality, as evidenced by policies such as the National Cancer Control Strategy (2011-2016). There are many Kenyan and international organizations devoted to this task; however, coordination is lacking among stakeholders, resulting in inefficient and overlapping expenditure of resources.; METHODS: The MOH and the NCI Center for Global Health collaboratively executed a two day workshop to improve coordination among government, NGO, and private organizations. Over 80 stakeholders participated from leading cancer research and control institutions in Kenya and the international sphere.; FINDINGS: Actionable recommendations include: establishment of a nationally representative population-based cancer registry; enhanced training for community health workers, nurses, researchers, pathologists, and oncology specialists; a reconfigured referral process, including leveraging of existing resources to improve access to cancer care; and coordinated community outreach and education. The MOH is in the process of forming a Technical Working Group (TWG) and has elected a Board of Directors for the newly established Kenyan National Cancer Institute (KNCI), with both entities committed to advancing the cancer control work of the MOH.; INTERPRETATION: This stakeholder meeting enhanced in-country networks, identified priority needs and developed actionable proposals for coordinated improvement of cancer research and control. Active, persistent follow-up by the TWG, KNCI, and other partners will be needed to turn proposals into reality and ensure that partners' investments are integrated into larger cancer control efforts prioritized by MOH.

AB CONTEXT: Healthy child development requires sufficient, quality sleep. Sleep problems in early childhood impair social-emotional and cognitive function and increase obesity risk. From a health literacy framework, "sleep health literacy" denotes the knowledge, motivation, and competencies to promote healthy sleep and to recognize a sleep problem.; DESIGN: To explore the untapped potential of early childhood education (ECE) programs to promote sleep health literacy, we surveyed staff (n=63) and parents (n=196) in Head Start about sleep-related knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, sleep hygiene, and sleep problems. Head Start is the largest ECE program in the United States.; RESULTS: Most parents believed that their child had healthy sleep habits (81%); few believed that he or she had a sleep problem (10%). Yet, unhealthy bedtime practices and insufficient sleep for age were reported in 50% and 33% of children, respectively. Between 10% and 12% of children had 1 or more sleep onset or awakening problems. Every unhealthy bedtime practice but one was associated with a sleep problem; parental presence at bedtime was associated with the most problems. Insufficient sleep was significantly associated with unhealthy sleep practices. More children with late vs early bedtimes (48% vs14%, P < .01) and frequent vs less frequent parental presence at bedtime (50% vs 26%-30%, P < .02) failed to obtain sufficient sleep. Staff members are more comfortable discussing healthy sleep with parents (87%) than counseling them (45%).; CONCLUSION: Among parents, there is a "disconnect" between actual and perceived sleep hygiene. Similarly, staff perceived a gap between their competencies to promote healthy sleep in families and their capacity to address sleep problems. US health literacy goals include the need to embed accurate, accessible, and actionable health information in ECE programs. Study findings strongly support the need to work toward sleep health literacy in ECE programs.

AB The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility allows testing of multiple cancer susceptibility genes simultaneously. While there are many potential benefits to utilizing this technology in the hereditary cancer clinic, including efficiency of time and cost, there are also important limitations that must be considered. The best panel for the given clinical situation should be selected to minimize the number of variants of unknown significance. The inclusion in panels of low penetrance or newly identified genes without specific actionability can be problematic for interpretation. Genetic counselors are an essential part of the hereditary cancer risk assessment team, helping the medical team select the most appropriate test and interpret the often complex results. Genetic counselors obtain an extended family history, counsel patients on the available tests and the potential implications of results for themselves and their family members (pre-test counseling), explain to patients the implications of the test results (post-test counseling), and assist in testing family members at risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been shown to limit the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Hospitals are increasingly relying on clinical decision support systems to assist in the demanding prescription reviewing process. In previous work, we have reported on an emerging clinical decision support system for antimicrobial stewardship that can learn new rules supervised by user feedback. In this paper, we report on the evaluation of this system.; METHODS: The evaluated system uses a knowledge base coupled with a supervised learning module that extracts classification rules for inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions using past recommendations for dose and dosing frequency adjustments, discontinuation of therapy, early switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and redundant antimicrobial spectrum. Over five weeks, the learning module was deployed alongside the baseline system to prospectively evaluate its ability to discover rules that complement the existing knowledge base for identifying inappropriate prescriptions of piperacillin-tazobactam, a frequently used antimicrobial.; RESULTS: The antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists reviewed 374 prescriptions, of which 209 (56% of 374) were identified as inappropriate leading to 43 recommendations to optimize prescriptions. The baseline system combined with the learning module triggered alerts in 270 prescriptions with a positive predictive value of identifying inappropriate prescriptions of 74%. Of these, 240 reviewed prescriptions were identified by the alerts of the baseline system with a positive predictive value of 82% and 105 reviewed prescriptions were identified by the alerts of the learning module with a positive predictive value of 62%. The combined system triggered alerts for all 43 recommendations, resulting in a rate of actionable alerts of 16% (43 recommendations of 270 reviewed alerts); the baseline system triggered alerts for 38 interventions, resulting in a rate of actionable alerts of 16% (38 of 240 reviewed alerts); and the learning module triggered alerts for 17 interventions, resulting in a rate of actionable alerts of 16% (17 of 105 reviewed alerts). The learning module triggered alerts for every inappropriate prescription missed by the knowledge base of the baseline system (n=5).; CONCLUSIONS: The learning module was able to extract clinically relevant rules for multiple types of antimicrobial alerts. The learned rules were shown to extend the knowledge base of the baseline system by identifying pharmacist interventions that were missed by the baseline system. The learned rules identified inappropriate prescribing practices that were not supported by local experts and were missing from its knowledge base. However, combining the baseline system and the learning module increased the number of false positives. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On September 4, 2011, a wildfire ignited in Bastrop County, Texas, resulting in losses of 34,068 acres of land and 1,645 homes and 2 deaths. At the request of the Texas Department of State Health Services Health Service Region 7 and the Bastrop County Office of Emergency Management, Community Assessments for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) were conducted in the weeks following the wildfire and again 3.5 years later to assess both the immediate and long-term public health and preparedness impacts of the wildfire. The objective of these assessments was to learn more about the trajectory of disaster recovery, including rebuilding, evacuation, household emergency planning, and mental and physical health outcomes among both adults and children. In 2015, households exposed to the 2011 wildfires were significantly more likely to have established a family meeting place and evacuation route, to have confidence in the local government's ability to respond to disaster, and to report symptoms of depression and higher stress. Longitudinal assessments using the CASPER method can provide actionable information for improved planning, preparedness, and recovery to public health and emergency management agencies and community residents.

AB Analysis of cell-free DNA using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for the detection/monitoring of alterations present in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Plasma extracted from 171 patients with a variety of cancers was analyzed for ctDNA (54 genes and copy number variants (CNVs) in three genes (EGFR, ERBB2 and MET)). The most represented cancers were lung (23%), breast (23%), and glioblastoma (19%). Ninety-nine patients (58%) had at least one detectable alteration. The most frequent alterations were TP53 (29.8%), followed by EGFR (17.5%), MET (10.5%), PIK3CA (7%), and NOTCH1 (5.8%). In contrast, of 222 healthy volunteers, only one had an aberration (TP53). Ninety patients with non-brain tumors had a discernible aberration (65% of 138 patients; in 70% of non-brain tumor patients with an alteration, the anomaly was potentially actionable). Interestingly, nine of 33 patients (27%) with glioblastoma had an alteration (6/33 (18%) potentially actionable). Overall, sixty-nine patients had potentially actionable alterations (40% of total; 69.7% of patients (69/99) with alterations); 68 patients (40% of total; 69% of patients with alterations), by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug. In summary, 65% of diverse cancers (as well as 27% of glioblastomas) had detectable ctDNA aberration(s), with the majority theoretically actionable by an approved agent.

AB SETTING: Electronic diagnostic tests, such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, are being implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, timely information from these tests available via remote monitoring is underutilized. The failure to transmit real-time, actionable data to key individuals such as clinicians, patients, and national monitoring and evaluation teams may negatively impact patient care.; OBJECTIVE: To describe recently developed applications that allow for real-time, remote monitoring of Xpert results, and initial implementation of one of these products in central Mozambique.; DESIGN: In partnership with the Mozambican National Tuberculosis Program, we compared three different remote monitoring tools for Xpert and selected one, GxAlert, to pilot and evaluate at five public health centers in Mozambique.; RESULTS: GxAlert software was successfully installed on all five Xpert computers, and test results are now uploaded daily via a USB internet modem to a secure online database. A password-protected web-based interface allows real-time analysis of test results, and 1200 positive tests for tuberculosis generated 8000 SMS result notifications to key individuals.; CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring of diagnostic platforms is feasible in LMICs. While promising, this effort needs to address issues around patient data ownership, confidentiality, interoperability, unique patient identifiers, and data security.

AB The goal of a diagnostic imaging examination is to provide the referring provider with an actionable imaging report that can be used to impart information to determine optimal clinical management for the patient. An actionable imaging report not only conveys the findings of the examination accurately, but does so in a timely and safe manner for an imaging examination that was performed appropriately and using the correct technique. The use of information technology tools has been paramount in improving the value of the imaging report and continues to play a prominent role in this process. The diversity of abdominal imaging, in both the variety of imaging modalities available and the organ systems evaluated, makes it well-suited to adopt these information technology solutions to improve report quality, including increased consistency in reports and in follow-up recommendations. This review discusses the components of the imaging chain involved in optimizing the imaging report with specific emphasis on the role of information technology applications to address the challenges that are frequently encountered. Specific abdominal imaging examples are presented to provide practical guidance and clinical context.

AB Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine documented and practised since 1500 B.C., follows a systems approach that has interesting parallels with contemporary personalized genomic medicine approaches to the understanding and management of health and disease. It is based on the trisutra, which are the three aspects of causes, features and therapeutics that are interconnected through a common organizing principle termed 'tridosha'. Tridosha comprise three ascertainable physiological entities; vata (kinetic), pitta (metabolic) and kapha (potential) that are pervasive across systems, work in conjunction with each other, respond to the external environment and maintain homeostasis. Each individual is born with a specific proportion of tridosha that are not only genetically determined but also influenced by the environment during foetal development. Jointly they determine a person's basic constitution, which is termed their 'prakriti'. Development and progressi on of different diseases with their subtypes are thought to depend on the origin and mechanism of perturbation of the doshas, and the aim of therapeutic practice is to ensure that the doshas retain their homeostatic state. Similarly, western systems biology epitomized by translational P4 medicine envisages the integration of multiscalar genetic, cellular, physiological and environmental networks to predict phenotypic outcomes of perturbations. In this perspective article, we aim to outline the shape of a unifying scaffold that may allow the two intellectual traditions to enhance one another. Specifically, we illustrate how a unique integrative 'Ayurgenomics' approach can be used to integrate the trisutra concept of Ayurveda with genomics. We observe biochemical and molecular correlates of prakriti and show how these differ significantly in processes that are linked to intermediate patho-phenotypes, known to take different course in diseases. We also observe a significant enr ichment of the highly connected hub genes which could explain differences in prakriti, focussing on EGLN1, a key oxygen sensor that differs between prakriti types and is linked to high altitude adaptation. Integrating our observation with the current literature, we demonstrate how EGLN1 could qualify as a molecular equivalent of tridosha that can modulate different phenotypic outcomes, where hypoxia is a cause or a consequence both during health and diseased states. Our studies affirm that integration of the trisutra framework through Ayurgenomics can guide the identification of predisposed groups of individuals and enable discovery of actionable therapeutic points in an individualized manner.

AB BACKGROUND: Assessment of the response to the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak indicates the need for innovations in data collection, sharing, and use to improve case detection and treatment. Here we introduce a Machine Learning pipeline for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) prognosis prediction, which packages the best models into a mobile app to be available in clinical care settings. The pipeline was trained on a public EVD clinical dataset, from 106 patients in Sierra Leone.; METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a new tool for exploratory analysis, Mirador, to identify the most informative clinical factors that correlate with EVD outcome. The small sample size and high prevalence of missing records were significant challenges. We applied multiple imputation and bootstrap sampling to address missing data and quantify overfitting. We trained several predictors over all combinations of covariates, which resulted in an ensemble of predictors, with and without viral load information, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.8 or more, after correcting for optimistic bias. We ranked the predictors by their F1-score, and those above a set threshold were compiled into a mobile app, Ebola CARE (Computational Assignment of Risk Estimates).; CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This method demonstrates how to address small sample sizes and missing data, while creating predictive models that can be readily deployed to assist treatment in future outbreaks of EVD and other infectious diseases. By generating an ensemble of predictors instead of relying on a single model, we are able to handle situations where patient data is partially available. The prognosis app can be updated as new data become available, and we made all the computational protocols fully documented and open-sourced to encourage timely data sharing, independent validation, and development of better prediction models in outbreak response.

AB OBJECTIVES: Emergency department (ED) discharge requires conveying critical information in a time-limited and distracting setting. Limited health literacy may put patients at risk of incomplete comprehension, but the relationship between discharge communication needs and health literacy has not been well defined. The goal of this study was to characterize the variation in needs and preferences regarding the ED discharge process by health literacy and identify novel ideas for process improvement from parents and patients.; METHODS: This was an in-depth qualitative interview study in two EDs using asthma as a model system for health communication. Adult patients and parents of pediatric patients with an asthma exacerbation and planned discharge were enrolled using purposive sampling to balance across literacy groups at each site. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, coded independently by two team members, and analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached in both literacy groups at each site.; RESULTS: In-depth interviews were completed with 51 participants: 20 adult patients and 31 pediatric parents. The majority of participants identified barriers related to ED providers, such as use of medical terminology, and systems of care, such as absence of protected time for discharge communication. Patients with limited health literacy, but not those with adequate literacy, identified conflicting information between health care sources as a barrier to successful ED discharge.; CONCLUSIONS: Participants across literacy groups and settings identified multiple actionable areas for improvement in the ED discharge process. These included the use of simplified/lay language, increased visual learning and demonstration, and the desire for complete information. Individuals with limited literacy may particularly benefit from increased attention to consistency. © 2015 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

AB Adequate plasma, cellular, and tissue vitamin C concentrations are required for maintaining optimal health through suppression of oxidative stress and optimizing functions of certain enzymes that require vitamin C as a cofactor. Polymorphisms in the vitamin C transporter genes, compromising genes encoding sodium-dependent ascorbate transport proteins, and also genes encoding facilitative transporters of dehydroascorbic acid, are associated with plasma and tissue cellular ascorbate status and hence cellular redox balance. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the links between variations in vitamin C transporter genes and common chronic diseases. We conclude that emerging genetic knowledge has a good likelihood of defining future personalized dietary recommendations and interventions; however, further validations through biological studies as well as controlled dietary trials are required to identify predictive and actionable genetic biomarkers. We further advocate the need to consider genetic variation of vitamin C transporters in future clinical and epidemiologic studies on common complex diseases.  © 2016 American Society for Nutrition.

AB INTRODUCTION: The incidence of unscheduled encounters and problem occurrence between ICD implant and first in-person evaluation (IPE) recommended at 12 weeks is unknown. Automatic remote home monitoring (HM) may be useful in this potentially unstable period.; METHODS AND RESULTS: ICD patients were randomized 2:1 to HM enabled post-implant (n = 908) or to conventional monitoring (CM; n = 431). Groups were compared between implant and prior to first scheduled IPE for IPE incidence, causes, and actionability (reprogramming, system revision, medication changes) and event detection time. HM and CM patients were similar (mean age 63 years, 72% male, LVEF 29%, primary prevention 73%, DDD 57%). In the post-implant interval assessed (HM 100 ± 21.3 days vs. CM 101 ± 20.8 days, P = 0.54), 85.4% (776/908) HM patients and 87.7% CM (378/431) patients had no cause for IPE (P = 0.31). When IPE occurred, actionability in HM (64/177 [36.2%]) was greater versus CM (15/62 [24.2%], P = 0.12). Actionable items were discovered sooner with HM (P = 0.025). Device reprogramming or lead revision was triggered following 53/177 (29.9%) IPEs in HM versus 9/62 (14.5%) in CM (P = 0.018). Arrhythmia detection was enhanced by HM: 276 atrial and ventricular episodes were detected in 135 follow-ups in contrast to CM (65 episodes at 17 IPEs). More silent arrhythmic episodes were discovered by HM (7.2% vs. 1.5% [P = 0.15]). Since 27/42 (64.3%) IPEs driven by HM alerts were actionable, event notification was a valuable method for problem detection. Importantly, HM did not increase incidence of non-actionable IPEs (P = 0.72).; CONCLUSION: Activation of automatic remote monitoring should be encouraged soon post-ICD implant. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Liposarcomas are one of the most common of more than 50 histologic subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas that, themselves, are heterogeneous. Liposarcomas fall into four distinct histologic subtypes: atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid (round cell) liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Definitive treatment remains surgical resection with negative margins for resectable disease. However, well-differentiated liposarcomas that are large or difficult to operate upon should be followed with close surveillance as long as there is no radiologic concern for a dedifferentiated component. In contrast, first-line chemotherapy with anthracycline with or without ifosfamide, or gemcitabine and docetaxel should be used for inoperable myxoid (round cell) or pleomorphic liposarcomas, which are relatively responsive to chemotherapy. In the second- and third-line setting, myxoid liposarcomas, in particular, seem to be sensitive to trabectedin, which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Eribulin offered a survival benefit when compared with dacarbazine in the third-line setting in liposarcomas (other than the well-differentiated subtype) and is now FDA approved. Recent studies have identified distinct genetic aberrations that not only aid in the diagnosis of liposarcoma subtypes but represent actionable targets. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and murine double minute 2 are overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas and offer opportunities that are being pursued in clinical trials. It is critical that liposarcomas are not approached by oncologists as one disease entity but rather subclassified into distinct subtypes using histologic and molecular tools before formalizing a treatment plan.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess whether integrating critical result management software--Alert Notification of Critical Results (ANCR)--with an electronic health record (EHR)-based results management application impacts closed-loop communication and follow-up of nonurgent, clinically significant radiology results by primary care providers (PCPs).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board-approved study was conducted at a large academic medical center. Postintervention, PCPs could acknowledge nonurgent, clinically significant ANCR-generated alerts ("alerts") within ANCR or the EHR. Primary outcome was the proportion of alerts acknowledged via EHR over a 24-month postintervention. Chart abstractions for a random sample of alerts 12 months preintervention and 24 months postintervention were reviewed, and the follow-up rate of actionable alerts (eg, performing follow-up imaging, administering antibiotics) was estimated. Pre- and postintervention rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. Postintervention follow-up rate was compared for EHR-acknowledged alerts vs ANCR.; RESULTS: Five thousand nine hundred and thirty-one alerts were acknowledged by 171 PCPs, with 100% acknowledgement (consistent with expected ANCR functionality). PCPs acknowledged 16% (688 of 4428) of postintervention alerts in the EHR, with the remaining in ANCR. Follow-up was documented for 85 of 90 (94%; 95% CI, 88%-98%) preintervention and 79 of 84 (94%; 95% CI, 87%-97%) postintervention alerts (P > .99). Postintervention, 11 of 14 (79%; 95% CI, 52%-92%) alerts were acknowledged via EHR and 68 of 70 (97%; 95% CI, 90%-99%) in ANCR had follow-up (P = .03).; CONCLUSIONS: Integrating ANCR and EHR provides an additional workflow for acknowledging nonurgent, clinically significant results without significant change in rates of closed-loop communication or follow-up of alerts. © The Author 2015.

AB UNLABELLED: Targeted therapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma consists of anti-EGFR therapy for patients with RAS/RAF wild-type tumors. However, the response rate remains low, suggesting the presence of alternative drivers possibly also representing potential therapeutic targets. We investigated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) alterations and MAP2K1 (MEK1) mutations in a large cohort of colorectal carcinoma patients studied by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets and The Cancer Genome Atlas, focusing on amplifications, fusions, and hotspot mutations in RTK genes and MAP2K1. RTK gene amplifications were confirmed with FISH and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Among 751 colorectal carcinoma cases with next-generation sequencing data, 7% and 1% of colorectal carcinoma harbored RTK alterations and MAP2K1 hotspot mutations (n = 7), respectively. RTK-altered cases had fewer concurrent RAS/RAF mutations (P = 0.003) than RTK/MAP2K1 wild-type colorectal carcinoma. MAP2K1-mutated colorectal carcinoma showed no RAS/RAF mutations. ERBB2 (n = 32) and EGFR (n = 13) were the most frequently altered RTKs, both activated by amplification and/or hotspot mutations. Three RTK fusions were identified: NCOA4-RET, ERBB2-GRB7, and ETV6-NTRK3. Only 1 of 6 patients with an RTK or MAP2K1 alteration who received anti-EGFR and/or anti-ERBB2 therapy demonstrated stable disease; the rest progressed immediately. Overall, RTK alterations and MAP2K1 mutations occur in approximately 8% of colorectal carcinoma. In spite of the usual absence of RAS/RAF mutations, response to anti-EGFR and/or anti-ERBB2 therapy was poor in this limited group. Larger studies are warranted to further define these kinase alterations as novel therapeutic targets in colorectal carcinoma and as negative predictors of response to anti-EGFR therapy.; IMPLICATIONS: Targetable kinase alterations were identified in a subset of advanced colorectal carcinoma patients, preferentially associated with wild-type RAS/RAF, and may predict poor response to standard anti-EGFR therapy. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the association between pre- and post-discharge factors and early readmission to acute psychiatric wards in a well-integrated community-based psychiatric service.; METHODS: The analysis consisted of all the hospital discharge records containing a psychiatric diagnosis in 2011 from four Italian acute inpatient wards. Socio-demographic, clinical, admission and aftercare variables were investigated as possible predictors of readmission at 7, 30 and 90 days after discharge and were analyzed, controlling for dependency among same-patient observations.; RESULTS: Previous psychiatric history was the most important predictor of readmissions. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients did not clearly influence readmission. Length of stay (LoS) was significant for readmission at 7 days even after controlling for other predictors and for same-patient dependence, in particular, for patients with previous admissions. Results suggest a protective role of a LoS higher than 28 days. In general, having a contact in community services did not turn out as protective from early readmission.; CONCLUSIONS: This paper contributes to increase the knowledge about factors that may predict the risk of early readmission. Implications for quality assessment in psychiatry emerged: readmission seems actionable by LoS and not by community follow-up. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A WHO roadmap to control, eliminate and eradicate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) proposes a public health approach integrating diverse prevention and treatment interventions. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) has long been a recognized, yet under-prioritized intervention of global disease control efforts. Through collaboration with the WASH sector, efforts have been made to integrate WASH in NTD control. This article reviews progress made in recent years, explores mechanisms supporting advances, and identifies priorities and next steps for accelerating WASH integration. This paper reveals advances in collaboration between WASH and NTD sectors, resulting in progress made across areas of programming; research; advocacy and policy; training and capacity building; and mapping, data collection and monitoring. Face to face meetings between WASH and NTD sector experts with a clear purpose of informing wider sector discussions, and the development of actionable joint workplans, have been particularly critical in supporting progress. Priority next steps include building capacity for WASH programming among NTD control teams, coordination at the country level, and strengthening the epidemiological evidence and operational learning for joint WASH and NTD interventions. In order to accelerate WASH integration in NTD control through strong collaborations with the WASH sector, the NTD sector could make use of strong data management skills and advocacy opportunities.  © The Author 2016.

AB Each year an open-microphone session is hosted by the Council Steering Committee. The committee invited an expert panel to discuss the use of effective communication in appropriate procedure selection and methods and resources to communicate the results of procedures performed in an actionable and clear manner to referring clinicians and patients, as well as downstream data systems. The ACR is actively encouraging radiologists to leverage existing and new technologies to increase their visibility in the health care system. Key features in Imaging 3.0 are results reporting through actionable reports, decision support for results reporting, guidelines for recommendations, tools for actionable reports, and tracking a radiologist's recommendations. The final radiology report is an essential product of our service, but it is increasingly clear that the noninterpretive components of our profession will add the most value to patient care. The radiology report is not the only evidence of our work. Nonetheless, the information quality and content of the radiology report can and must be improved so that it can add value and clinical usefulness toward excellent patient care. We must use appropriate tools and "best knowledge" to deliver actionable and value-added high-quality reports.  Copyright © 2016 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Interrogation/interpretation of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is frequently required in the emergency department (ED) or perioperative areas (OR) where resources to do this are often not available. CareLink Express (CLE; Medtronic, plc, Mounds View, MN, USA) is a technician-supported real-time remote interrogation system for Medtronic CIEDs. Using data from 136 US locations, this retrospective study was designed to assess CLE efficiency compared to traditional device management, and examine its findings.; METHODS: All 7,044 US CLE transmissions from the ED and OR (January 2012-October 2014) were compared to 217 traditional requests where CIED interrogations/interpretations were performed by calling industry representatives to these sites.; RESULTS: CLE reduced the time to device interrogation/interpretation by 78%: 100 ± 140-22 ± 14 minutes, P < 0.0001, improving response time and consistency; ED: 82 ± 103-23 ± 18 minutes, P, ≤ 0.01; OR: 127 ± 181-17 ± 10 minutes, P < 0.0001. Actionable events (AE) (arrhythmia, device/lead abnormalities) were infrequent: 9.1% overall (ED: 9.9%; OR: 4.1%). Only 6.5% of patients with syncope/presyncope and 13.6% with a perceived shock had AE. AEs were more common in those with suspected device problems (30.4%) or audible alerts (52.6%). They were more likely in patients not enrolled in long-term remote monitoring (23.9% vs 8.2%, P < 0.0001) and in those with older CIED systems (7.4% in year 1 vs 31.0% after 10 years).; CONCLUSIONS: The many patients with CIEDs, and the ability to quickly identify the minority with high-risk AE from the no/low-risk majority, strongly support CLE use in the ED and OR, sites which are expensive and prioritize efficiency. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB During the past 20years, the studies on genetics or pharmacogenomics of primary hypertension provided interesting results supporting the role of genetics, but no actionable finding ready to be translated into personalized medicine. Two types of approaches have been applied: a "hypothesis-driven" approach on the candidate genes, coding for proteins involved in the biochemical machinery underlying the regulation of BP, and an "unbiased hypothesis-free" approach with GWAS, based on the randomness principles of frequentist statistics. During the past 10-15years, the application of the latter has overtaken the application of the former leading to an enlargement of the number of previously unknown candidate loci or genes but without any actionable result for the therapy of hypertension. In the present review, we summarize the results of our hypothesis-driven approach based on studies carried out in rats with genetic hypertension and in humans with essential hypertension at the pre-hypertensive and early hypertensive stages. These studies led to the identification of mutant adducin and endogenous ouabain as candidate genetic-molecular mechanisms in both species. Rostafuroxin has been developed for its ability to selectively correct Na(+) pump abnormalities sustained by the two abovementioned mechanisms and to selectively reduce BP in rats and in humans carrying the gene variants underlying the mutant adducin and endogenous ouabain (EO) effects. A clinical trial is ongoing to substantiate these findings. Future studies should apply both the candidate gene and GWAS approaches to fully exploit the potential of genetics in optimizing the personalized therapy.

AB Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has redefined the genetic landscape of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) by identifying recurrent somatic mutations. Importantly, in some cases these mutations impact potentially actionable targets, thus affording novel personalized therapy opportunities. At the forefront of today's precision therapy era, how to best incorporate NGS into daily clinical practice is of primordial concern, in order to tailor patient's treatment regimens according to their individual mutational profiles. With the advent of cell-free DNA sequencing, which provides a sensitive and less invasive means of monitoring DLBCL patients, the clinical feasibility of NGS has been greatly improved. This article reviews the current landscape of DLBCL mutations, as well as the targeted therapies developed to counter their effects, and discusses how best to utilize NGS data for treatment decision-making.

AB Angiogenesis associates with poor outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but the contribution of the lymphoma cells to this process remains unclear. Addressing this knowledge gap may uncover unsuspecting proangiogenic signaling nodes and highlight alternative antiangiogenic therapies. Here, we identify the second messenger cyclic-AMP (cAMP) and the enzyme that terminates its activity, phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), as regulators of B-cell lymphoma angiogenesis. We first show that cAMP, in a PDE4B-dependent manner, suppresses PI3K/AKT signals to downmodulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and vessel formation in vitro. Next, we create a novel mouse model that combines the lymphomagenic Myc transgene with germline deletion of Pde4b. We show that lymphomas developing in a Pde4b-null background display significantly lower microvessel density (MVD) in association with lower VEGF levels and PI3K/AKT activity. We recapitulate these observations by treating lymphoma-bearing mice with the FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitor, Roflumilast. Lastly, we show that primary human DLBCLs with high PDE4B expression display significantly higher MVD. Here, we defined an unsuspected signaling circuitry in which the cAMP generated in lymphoma cells downmodulates PI3K/AKT and VEGF secretion to negatively influence vessel development in the microenvironment. These data identify PDE4 as an actionable antiangiogenic target in DLBCL.

AB Recent developments in massively parallel sequencing and digital genomic techniques support the clinical validity of cell-free circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as a 'liquid biopsy' in human cancer. In breast cancer, ctDNA detected in plasma can be used to non-invasively scan tumour genomes and quantify tumour burden. The applications for ctDNA in plasma include identifying actionable genomic alterations, monitoring treatment responses, unravelling therapeutic resistance, and potentially detecting disease progression before clinical and radiological confirmation. ctDNA may be used to characterise tumour heterogeneity and metastasis-specific mutations providing information to adapt the therapeutic management of patients. In this article, we review the current status of ctDNA as a 'liquid biopsy' in breast cancer.  Copyright © 2015 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB While experts have made recommendations, information is needed regarding what genome sequencing results patients would want returned. We investigated what results women diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age would want returned and why. We conducted 60 semi-structured, in-person individual interviews with women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or younger. We examined interest in six types of incidental findings and reasons for interest or disinterest in each type. Two coders independently coded interview transcripts; analysis was conducted using NVivo 10. Most participants were at least somewhat interested in all six result types, but strongest interest was in actionable results (i.e. variants affecting risk of a preventable or treatable disease and treatment response). Reasons for interest varied between different result types. Some participants were not interested or ambivalent about results not seen as currently actionable. Participants wanted to be able to choose what results are returned. Participants distinguished between types of individual genome sequencing results, with different reasons for wanting different types of information. The findings suggest that a focus on actionable results can be a common ground for all stakeholders in developing a policy for returning individual genome sequencing results.  © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB OBJECTIVES: Patient care decisions demand high-quality research. To assist those decisions, numerous observational studies are being performed. Are the standards and guidelines to assess observational studies consistent and actionable? What policy considerations should be considered to ensure decision makers can determine if an observational study is of high-quality and valid to inform treatment decisions?; STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Based on a literature review and input from six experts, we compared and contrasted nine standards/guidelines using 23 methodological elements involved in observational studies (e.g., study protocol, data analysis, and so forth).; RESULTS: Fourteen elements (61%) were addressed by at least seven standards/guidelines; 12 of these elements disagreed in the approach. Nine elements (39%) were addressed by six or fewer standards/guidelines. Ten elements (43%) were not actionable in at least one standard/guideline that addressed the element.; CONCLUSION: The lack of observational study standard/guideline agreement may contribute to variation in study conduct; disparities in what is considered credible research; and ultimately, what evidence is adopted. A common set of agreed on standards/guidelines for conducting observational studies will benefit funders, researchers, journal editors, and decision makers. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

AB A need exists for robust and cost-effective assays to detect a single or small set of actionable point mutations, or a complete set of clinically informative mutant alleles. Knowledge of these mutations can be used to alert the clinician to a rare mutation that might necessitate more aggressive clinical monitoring or a personalized course of treatment. An example is BRAF, a (proto)oncogene susceptible to either common or rare mutations in codon V600 and adjacent codons. We report a diagnostic technology that leverages the unique capabilities of droplet digital PCR to achieve not only accurate and sensitive detection of BRAF(V600E) but also all known somatic point mutations within the BRAF V600 codon. The simple and inexpensive two-well droplet digital PCR assay uses a chimeric locked nucleic acid/DNA probe against wild-type BRAF and a novel wild-type-negative screening paradigm. The assay shows complete diagnostic accuracy when applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from metastatic colorectal cancer patients deficient for Mut L homologue-1.

AB Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are breast fibroepithelial lesions that are graded based on histological criteria as benign, borderline or malignant. PTs may recur locally. Borderline PTs and malignant PTs may metastasize to distant sites. Breast fibroepithelial lesions, including PTs and fibroadenomas, are characterized by recurrent MED12 exon 2 somatic mutations. We sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations in PTs and whether these may assist in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. We collected 100 fibroadenomas, 40 benign PTs, 14 borderline PTs and 22 malignant PTs; six, six and 13 benign, borderline and malignant PTs, respectively, and their matched normal tissue, were subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) using the MSK-IMPACT sequencing assay. Recurrent MED12 mutations were found in 56% of PTs; in addition, mutations affecting cancer genes (eg TP53, RB1, SETD2 and EGFR) were exclusively detected in borderline and malignant PTs. We found a novel recurrent clonal hotspot mutation in the TERT promoter (-124 C>T) in 52% and TERT gene amplification in 4% of PTs. Laser capture microdissection revealed that these mutations were restricted to the mesenchymal component of PTs. Sequencing analysis of the entire cohort revealed that the frequency of TERT alterations increased from benign (18%) to borderline (57%) and to malignant PTs (68%; p < 0.01), and TERT alterations were associated with increased levels of TERT mRNA (p < 0.001). No TERT alterations were observed in fibroadenomas. An analysis of TERT promoter sequencing and gene amplification distinguished PTs from fibroadenomas with a sensitivity and a positive predictive value of 100% (CI 95.38-100%) and 100% (CI 85.86-100%), respectively, and a sensitivity and a negative predictive value of 39% (CI 28.65-51.36%) and 68% (CI 60.21-75.78%), respectively. Our results suggest that TERT alterations may drive the progression of PTs, and may assist in the differential diagnosis between PTs and fibroadenomas.

AB Because of the unique systems and skills involved in patient care by the pathologist, it is challenging to design and implement relevant training in patient safety for pathology trainees. We propose a patient safety curriculum for anatomic pathology (AP) residents based on our institutional experience. The Hospital of the University of the Pennsylvania employs a self-reporting safety database. The occurrences from July 2013 to June 2015 recorded in this system that involved the division of AP were reviewed and cataloged as preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic. The distribution of these occurrences was then used to create a framework for curriculum development in AP. We identified areas in which trainees are involved in the identification and prevention of common patient safety errors that occur in our AP department. Using these data-proven target areas, and employing current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recommendations and patient safety literature, a strategy for delivering relevant patient safety training is proposed. Teaching patient safety to pathology trainees is a challenging, yet necessary, component of AP training programs. By analyzing the patient safety errors that occur in the AP department, relevant and actionable training can be developed. This provides quality professional development and improves overall performance as trainees are integrated into laboratory systems.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Therapeutic failure in acute myeloid leukemia remains common. It may be advantageous to identify patients with suboptimal treatment responses early as they may benefit from timely care strategy changes. Here, responses portending failure of standard induction therapy are reviewed and therapeutic options examined, including use of investigational, targeted agents for suitable patients.; RECENT FINDINGS: Patients entering complete remission without minimal residual disease early, that is, with one cycle of standard induction chemotherapy, have a lower relapse risk and live longer than other similarly-treated patients, supporting the proposition of early complete remission without minimal residual disease as a criterion for induction therapy success. Investigational small molecule drugs are appealing for patients who fail standard therapies, but complete remission rates as a single agent are typically modest.; SUMMARY: The relative value of different treatment strategies if a first standard induction therapy cycle fails to produce complete remission is unknown. However, retreatment with the same therapy often leads to complete remission and provides a benchmark against which other approaches should be compared. Addition of investigational small molecule drugs to standard reinduction therapy in patients with actionable targets could offer an attractive therapeutic strategy in this situation that might improve outcomes and facilitate clinical drug testing.

AB PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the various types of technical and clinical denials that are usually "written off" and proposes strategies to prevent this loss. For purposes of this writing, avoidable technical and clinical denial write-offs are defined as revenue lost from "first-pass" denials rejections. For example, a procedure that requires an authorization is performed without having had an authorization obtained. After appeals and attempts to recoup the revenue, often unsuccessful, the organization ultimately "writes off" the revenue as not collectable. The question to ask is: Are these claims really not collectable or can actionable steps be taken to conserve these dollars and improve the bottom line?; PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: Acute care hospitals, physician offices, and clinics.; FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: In today's environment, the need to manage costs is ubiquitous. Cost management is on the priority list of all savvy health care executives, even if margins are healthy, revenue is under pressure, and the magnitude of cost reduction needed is greater than what past efforts have achieved. As hospitals and physician clinics prioritize areas for improvement, reduction in lost revenue-especially avoidable lost revenue-should be at the top of the list. Attentively managing claim denial write-offs will significantly reduce lost revenue.; IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT: There is significant interface between case management and the revenue cycle. Developing core competencies for reducing clinical and technical denials should be a critical imperative in overall cost management strategy. Case managers are well placed to prevent these unnecessary losses through accurate status determination and clinical documentation review. These clinical professionals can also provide insight into work flow and other processes inherent in the preauthorization process.

AB Synchronous colorectal carcinomas (sCRC) are clinically challenging neoplasms. Although the epidemiological characteristics are quite well established, their biological basis is still poorly understood. Hence, we performed comprehensive molecular profiling of 23 sCRC cases comprising 50 synchronous primary tumors, 5 metastases, and corresponding normal tissue by targeted deep sequencing of 30 CRC-related genes, microsatellite analysis and analysis for methylated MLH1. We identified a striking inter- and intratumoral genetic heterogeneity of sCRC. Twenty (87%) cases showed genetic heterogeneity leaving only three cases with tumors that had an identical genetic make-up. Intertumoral heterogeneity was frequently observed for clinically actionable genes, including KRAS. Specifically, 44% of the cases harbored tumors of which at least one was KRAS mutated and the other KRAS wildtype. Moreover, 48% of the cases had at least double, sometimes even triple or quadruple mutations in KRAS, APC, TP53, PIK3CA, and TGFBR2, most of them being subclonal events. Lastly, we detected four cases (17%) with microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors with one case harboring one MSI- and a distinct microsatellite stable carcinoma. Our data demonstrate a striking genetic heterogeneity not only between different sCRC of a single case but also within a single tumor. These results contribute to the biological understanding of sCRC and directly impact genotyping strategies and oncological decision making. Testing one tumor or a single metastasis may not suffice in the sCRC setting as clinically relevant and tumor-specific genetic information may be left undetected compromising optimal oncological therapy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in breast cancer. However, the relationship between methylation patterns and the heterogeneity of breast cancer has not been comprehensively characterized.; METHODS: Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays was performed on 188 human breast tumors. Unsupervised bootstrap consensus clustering was performed to identify DNA methylation epigenetic subgroups (epitypes). The Cancer Genome Atlas data, including methylation profiles of 669 human breast tumors, was used for validation. The identified epitypes were characterized by integration with publicly available genome-wide data, including gene expression levels, DNA copy numbers, whole-exome sequencing data, and chromatin states.; RESULTS: We identified seven breast cancer epitypes. One epitype was distinctly associated with basal-like tumors and with BRCA1 mutations, one epitype contained a subset of ERBB2-amplified tumors characterized by multiple additional amplifications and the most complex genomes, and one epitype displayed a methylation profile similar to normal epithelial cells. Luminal tumors were stratified into the remaining four epitypes, with differences in promoter hypermethylation, global hypomethylation, proliferative rates, and genomic instability. Specific hyper- and hypomethylation across the basal-like epitype was rare. However, we observed that the candidate genomic instability drivers BRCA1 and HORMAD1 displayed aberrant methylation linked to gene expression levels in some basal-like tumors. Hypomethylation in luminal tumors was associated with DNA repeats and subtelomeric regions. We observed two dominant patterns of aberrant methylation in breast cancer. One pattern, constitutively methylated in both basal-like and luminal breast cancer, was linked to genes with promoters in a Polycomb-repressed state in normal epithelial cells and displayed no correlation with gene expression levels. The second pattern correlated with gene expression levels and was associated with methylation in luminal tumors and genes with active promoters in normal epithelial cells.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hypermethylation patterns across basal-like breast cancer may have limited influence on tumor progression and instead reflect the repressed chromatin state of the tissue of origin. On the contrary, hypermethylation patterns specific to luminal breast cancer influence gene expression, may contribute to tumor progression, and may present an actionable epigenetic alteration in a subset of luminal breast cancers.

AB We employed a customized Multiple Myeloma (MM)-specific Mutation Panel (M(3)P) to screen a homogenous cohort of 142 untreated MM patients for relevant mutations in a selection of disease-specific genes. M(3)Pv2.0 includes 77 genes selected for being either actionable targets, potentially related to drug-response or part of known key pathways in MM biology. We identified mutations in potentially actionable genes in 49% of patients and provided prognostic evidence of STAT3 mutations. This panel may serve as a practical alternative to more comprehensive sequencing approaches, providing genomic information in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus allowing clinically oriented variant screening in MM.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical responses to anti-cancer therapies often only benefit a defined subset of patients. Predicting the best treatment strategy hinges on our ability to effectively translate genomic data into actionable information on drug responses.; RESULTS: To achieve this goal, we compiled a comprehensive collection of baseline cancer genome data and drug response information derived from a large panel of cancer cell lines. This data set was applied to identify the signature genes relevant to drug sensitivity and their resistance by integrating CNVs and the gene expression of cell lines with in vitro drug responses. We presented an efficient in-silico pipeline for integrating heterogeneous cell line data sources with the simultaneous modeling of drug response values across all the drugs and cell lines. Potential signature genes correlated with drug response (sensitive or resistant) in different cancer types were identified. Using signature genes, our collaborative filtering-based drug response prediction model outperformed the 44 algorithms submitted to the DREAM competition on breast cancer cells. The functions of the identified drug response related signature genes were carefully analyzed at the pathway level and the synthetic lethality level. Furthermore, we validated these signature genes by applying them to the classification of the different subtypes of the TCGA tumor samples, and further uncovered their in vivo implications using clinical patient data.; CONCLUSIONS: Our work may have promise in translating genomic data into customized marker genes relevant to the response of specific drugs for a specific cancer type of individual patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Poorly managed hospital discharges and care transitions between health care facilities can cause poor outcomes for both patients and their caregivers. Unfortunately, the usual approach to health care delivery does not support continuity and coordination across the settings of hospital, doctors' offices, home or nursing homes. Though complex efforts with multiple components can improve patient outcomes and reduce 30-day readmissions, research has not identified which components are necessary. Also we do not know how delivery of core components may need to be adjusted based on patient, caregiver, setting or characteristics of the community, or how system redesign can be accelerated.; METHODS/DESIGN: Project ACHIEVE focuses on diverse Medicare populations such as individuals with multiple chronic diseases, patients with low health literacy/numeracy and limited English proficiency, racial and ethnic minority groups, low-income groups, residents of rural areas, and individuals with disabilities. During the first phase, we will use focus groups to identify the transitional care outcomes and components that matter most to patients and caregivers to inform development and validation of assessment instruments. During the second phase, we will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of multi-component care transitions programs occurring across the U.S. Using a mixed-methods approach for this evaluation, we will study historical (retrospective) and current and future (prospective) groups of patients, caregivers and providers using site visits, surveys, and clinical and claims data. In this natural experiment observational study, we use a fractional factorial study design to specify comparators and estimate the individual and combined effects of key transitional care components.; DISCUSSION: Our study will determine which evidence-based transitional care components and/or clusters most effectively produce patient and caregiver desired outcomes overall and among diverse patient and caregiver populations in different healthcare settings. Using the results, we will develop concrete, actionable recommendations regarding how best to implement these strategies. Finally, this work will provide tools for hospitals, community-based organizations, patients, caregivers, clinicians and other stakeholders to help them make informed decisions about which strategies are most effective and how best to implement them in their communities.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered as NCT02354482 on clinicaltrials.gov on 1/29/2015.

AB Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment has critical roles in all aspects of cancer biology, including growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and progression. Although chemokines and their receptors were originally identified as mediators of inflammatory diseases, it is being increasingly recognized that they serve as critical communication bridges between tumor cells and stromal cells to create a permissive microenvironment for tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, an important therapeutic strategy for cancer is to break this communication channel and isolate tumor cells for long-term elimination. Cytokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal-derived factor 1alpha) and its receptor CXCR4 represent the most promising actionable targets for this strategy. Both are overexpressed in various cancer types, and this aberrant expression strongly promotes proliferation, migration and invasion through multiple signal pathways. Several molecules that target CXCL12 or CXCR4 have been developed to interfere with tumor growth and metastasis. In this article, we review our current understanding of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in cancer tumorigenesis and progression and discuss its therapeutic implications.

AB PURPOSE: The expression of HAGE as a novel prognostic and predictive tool was assessed in 1,079 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HAGE protein expression was investigated in an early primary TNBC (EP-TNBC; n = 520) cohort who received adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) and in a locally advanced primary TNBC cohort who received anthracycline combination Neo-ACT (n = 110; AC-Neo-ACT). HAGE-mRNA expression was evaluated in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort (n = 311) who received ACT and in a cohort of patients with TNBC who received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide Neo-ACT, followed by 1:1 randomization to ixabepilone (n = 68) or paclitaxel (n = 64) as part of a phase II clinical trial. Furthermore, a cohort of 128 tumors with integrated HAGE gene copy number changes, mRNA, and protein levels were analyzed.; RESULTS: In patients with EP-TNBC, who were chemotherapy-naive, high HAGE protein expression (HAGE(+)) was associated with a higher risk of death [HR, 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-1.5; P = 0.000005] when compared with HAGE(-) cases. Patients who received ACT and expressed mRNA-HAGE(+) were at a lower risk of death than those who were mRNA-HAGE(-) (P = 0.004). The expression of HAGE was linked to the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and both features were found to be independent predictors for pathologic complete response (pCR, P < 0.001) and associated with prolonged survival (P < 0.01), following AC-Neo-ACT. In patients with residual disease, HAGE(+) had a 2-fold death risk increase (P = 0.018) compared with HAGE(-).; CONCLUSIONS: HAGE expression is a potential prognostic marker and a predictor of response to anthracycline treatment in TNBC. A prospective clinical trial to examine the therapeutic value of HAGE for TNBC cases is warranted. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: Tumor genotyping is a powerful tool for guiding non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) care; however, comprehensive tumor genotyping can be logistically cumbersome. To facilitate genotyping, we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay using a desktop sequencer to detect actionable mutations and rearrangements in cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA).; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An NGS panel was developed targeting 11 driver oncogenes found in NSCLC. Targeted NGS was performed using a novel methodology that maximizes on-target reads, and minimizes artifact, and was validated on DNA dilutions derived from cell lines. Plasma NGS was then blindly performed on 48 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known tumor genotype, and explored in two patients with incomplete tumor genotyping.; RESULTS: NGS could identify mutations present in DNA dilutions at ≥ 0.4% allelic frequency with 100% sensitivity/specificity. Plasma NGS detected a broad range of driver and resistance mutations, including ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements, HER2 insertions, and MET amplification, with 100% specificity. Sensitivity was 77% across 62 known driver and resistance mutations from the 48 cases; in 29 cases with common EGFR and KRAS mutations, sensitivity was similar to droplet digital PCR. In two cases with incomplete tumor genotyping, plasma NGS rapidly identified a novel EGFR exon 19 deletion and a missed case of MET amplification.; CONCLUSIONS: Blinded to tumor genotype, this plasma NGS approach detected a broad range of targetable genomic alterations in NSCLC with no false positives including complex mutations like rearrangements and unexpected resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S. Through use of widely available vacutainers and a desktop sequencing platform, this assay has the potential to be implemented broadly for patient care and translational research. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Although the "right not to know" is well established in international regulations, it has been heavily debated. Ubiquitous results from extended exome and genome analysis have challenged the right not to know. American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Recommendations urge to inform about incidental findings that pretend to be accurate and actionable. However, ample clinical cases raise the question whether these criteria are met. Many incidental findings are of uncertain significance (IFUS). The eager to feedback information appears to enter the field of IFUS and thereby threaten the right not to know. This makes it imperative to investigate the arguments for and against a right not to know for IFUS.; DISCUSSION: This article investigates how the various arguments for and against a right not to know hold for IFUS. The main investigated arguments are: hypothetical utilitarianism, the right-based argument, the feasibility argument, the value of knowledge argument, the argument from lost significance, the empirical argument, the duty to disclose argument, the avoiding harm argument; the argument from principle, from autonomy, from privacy, as well as the argument from the right to an open future. The analysis shows that both sides in the debate have exaggerated the importance of incidental findings. Opponents of a right not to know have exaggerated the importance of IFUS, while proponents have exaggerated the need to be protected from something that is not knowledge. Hence, to know or not to know is not the question. The question is whether we should be able to stay ignorant of incidental findings of uncertain significance, if we want to. The answer is yes: As long as the information is not accurate and/or actionable: ignorance is bliss. When answering questions that are not asked, we need to think twice.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing 85% of all diagnoses. Late stage detection, metastatic disease and lack of actionable biomarkers contribute to the high mortality rate. Proteins in the extracellular space are known to be critically involved in regulating every stage of the pathogenesis of lung cancer. To investigate the mechanism by which secreted proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of NSCLC, we performed quantitative secretomic analysis of two isogenic NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H1993 and NCI-H2073) and an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) as control. H1993 was derived from a chemo-naive metastatic tumor, while H2073 was derived from the primary tumor after etoposide/cisplatin therapy. From the conditioned media of these three cell lines, we identified and quantified 2713 proteins, including a series of proteins involved in regulating inflammatory response, programmed cell death and cell motion. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicates that a number of proteins overexpressed in H1993 media are involved in biological processes related to cancer metastasis, including cell motion, cell-cell adhesion and cell migration. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock down of a number of these proteins, including SULT2B1, CEACAM5, SPRR3, AGR2, S100P, and S100A14, leads to dramatically reduced migration of these cells. In addition, meta-analysis of survival data indicates NSCLC patients whose tumors express higher levels of several of these secreted proteins, including SULT2B1, CEACAM5, SPRR3, S100P, and S100A14, have a worse prognosis. Collectively, our results provide a potential molecular link between deregulated secretome and NSCLC cell migration/metastasis. In addition, the identification of these aberrantly secreted proteins might facilitate the development of biomarkers for early detection of this devastating disease.

AB Objectives To explore the relationships among social, economic, environmental, and health services determinants of tuberculosis (TB) morbidity and mortality, and to identify the mechanisms that mediate such associations in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods This was an ecological study of 26 LAC countries that had accurate data available on 38 selected variables for the year 2010. The countries represented 99% of the TB burden in LAC. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify associations among determinants of health and TB morbidity and mortality. Results TB-HIV coinfection and multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) in previously treated cases were found to be positively associated to TB morbidity and negatively associated to improved basic sanitation and water coverage-pointing to an increase of TB morbidity in the first two variables and a decrease of TB morbidity in the last two. Regarding TB mortality, indigenous people and MDR-TB in previously treated cases were positively associated. In contrast, literacy among women, basic sanitation, water coverage, and nutritional status were negatively associated to mortality, denoting that improvements in these areas could reduce TB mortality. Conclusions The study findings support intersectoral actions that address social, economic, environmental, and health services determinants within the Stop TB strategy. The mechanisms by which social determinants of health affect current trend outcomes extend beyond medical interventions to control TB, but more research is needed to understand how and to develop actionable recommendations.

AB According to a patient-centered viewpoint, the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made. Harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information. Although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods, the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process (TTP), such as terminology and units, report formats, reference intervals and decision limits, as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation. Two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine: first, the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the TTP, thus dealing with the request, the sample, the measurement, and the report. Second, as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated, a systematic approach is needed. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays, and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a treatable contributor to morbidity and mortality. However, most patients with OSA remain undiagnosed. We used a new machine learning method known as SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer Models) to test the hypothesis that a diagnostic screening tool based on routinely available medical information would be superior to one based solely on patient-reported sleep-related symptoms.; METHODS: We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) and self-reported clinical information from 1,922 patients tested in our clinical sleep laboratory. We used SLIM and 7 state-of-the-art classification methods to produce predictive models for OSA screening using features from: (i) self-reported symptoms; (ii) self-reported medical information that could, in principle, be extracted from electronic health records (demographics, comorbidities), or (iii) both.; RESULTS: For diagnosing OSA, we found that model performance using only medical history features was superior to model performance using symptoms alone, and similar to model performance using all features. Performance was similar to that reported for other widely used tools: sensitivity 64.2% and specificity 77%. SLIM accuracy was similar to state-of-the-art classification models applied to this dataset, but with the benefit of full transparency, allowing for hands-on prediction using yes/no answers to a small number of clinical queries.; CONCLUSION: To predict OSA, variables such as age, sex, BMI, and medical history are superior to the symptom variables we examined for predicting OSA. SLIM produces an actionable clinical tool that can be applied to data that is routinely available in modern electronic health records, which may facilitate automated, rather than manual, OSA screening.; COMMENTARY: A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page 159. © 2015 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

AB Basket clinical trials are a new category of early clinical trials in which a treatment is evaluated in a population of patients with tumors of various histologic types and primary sites selected for containing specific genomic abnormalities. The objective of such studies is generally to discover histologic types in which the treatment is active. Basket trials are early discovery trials whose results should be confirmed in expanded histology specific cohorts. In this report, we develop a design for planning, monitoring, and analyzing basket trials.

AB An improved prognostic stratification of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and pathologically positive (pN+) nodes is urgently needed. Here, we sought to examine whether an ultra-deep targeted sequencing (UDT-Seq) gene panel may improve the prognostic stratification in this patient group.A mutation-based signature affecting 10 genes (including genetic mutations in 6 oncogenes and 4 tumor suppressor genes) was devised to predict disease-free survival (DFS) in 345 primary tumor specimens obtained from pN+ OSCC patients. Of the 345 patients, 144 were extracapsular spread (ECS)-negative and 201 were ECS-positive. The 5-year locoregional control, distant metastases, disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (OS) rates served as outcome measures.The UDT-Seq panel was an independent risk factor (RF) for 5-year locoregional control (P = 0.0067), distant metastases (P = 0.0001), DFS (P < 0.0001), disease-specific survival (DSS, P < 0.0001), and OS (P = 0.0003) in pN+ OSCC patients. The presence of ECS and pT3-4 disease were also independent RFs for DFS, DSS, and OS. A prognostic scoring system was formulated by summing up the significant covariates (UDT-Seq, ECS, pT3-4) separately for each survival endpoint. The presence of a positive UDT-Seq panel (n = 77) significantly improved risk stratification for all the survival endpoints as compared with traditional AJCC staging (P < 0.0001). Among ECS-negative patients, those with a UDT-Seq-positive panel (n = 31) had significantly worse DFS (P = 0.0005) and DSS (P = 0.0002). Among ECS-positive patients, those with a UDT-Seq-positive panel (n = 46) also had significantly worse DFS (P = 0.0032) and DSS (P = 0.0098).Our UDT-Seq gene panel consisting of clinically actionable genes was significantly associated with patient outcomes and provided better prognostic stratification than traditional AJCC staging. It was also able to predict prognosis in OSCC patients regardless of ECS presence.

AB Following the 2013 Chelyabinsk event, the risks posed by asteroids attracted renewed interest, from both the scientific and policy-making communities. It reminded the world that impacts from near-Earth objects (NEOs), while rare, have the potential to cause great damage to cities and populations. Point estimates of the risk (such as mean numbers of casualties) have been proposed, but because of the low-probability, high-consequence nature of asteroid impacts, these averages provide limited actionable information. While more work is needed to further refine its input distributions (e.g., NEO diameters), the probabilistic model presented in this article allows a more complete evaluation of the risk of NEO impacts because the results are distributions that cover the range of potential casualties. This model is based on a modularized simulation that uses probabilistic inputs to estimate probabilistic risk metrics, including those of rare asteroid impacts. Illustrative results of this analysis are presented for a period of 100 years. As part of this demonstration, we assess the effectiveness of civil defense measures in mitigating the risk of human casualties. We find that they are likely to be beneficial but not a panacea. We also compute the probability-but not the consequences-of an impact with global effects ("cataclysm"). We conclude that there is a continued need for NEO observation, and for analyses of the feasibility and risk-reduction effectiveness of space missions designed to deflect or destroy asteroids that threaten the Earth.  © 2015 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB The lack of actionable mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents a significant hurdle in the design of targeted therapies for this disease. Here, we identify somatically mutated ABL1 as a genetic dependency that is required to maintain NSCLC cell survival. We demonstrate that NSCLC cells with ABL1 mutations are sensitive to ABL inhibitors and we verify that the drug-induced effects on cell viability are specific to pharmacological inhibition of the ABL1 kinase. Furthermore, we confirm that imatinib suppresses lung tumor growth invivo, specifically in lung cancer cells harboring a gain-of-function (GOF) mutation in ABL1. Consistent with structural modeling, we demonstrate that mutations in ABL1 identified in primary NSCLC tumors and a lung cancer cell line increase downstream pathway activation compared to wild-type ABL1. Finally, we observe that the ABL1 cancer mutants display an increased cytosolic localization, which is associated with the oncogenic properties of the ABL1 kinase. In summary, our results suggest that NSCLC patients with ABL1 mutations could be stratified for treatment with imatinib in combination with other therapies.  © 2016 The Authors.

AB The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that mutations in 56 genes for 24 conditions are clinically actionable and should be reported as secondary findings after whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Our aim was to identify published economic evaluations of detecting mutations in these genes among the general population or among targeted/high-risk populations and conditions and identify gaps in knowledge. A targeted PubMed search from 1994 through November 2014 was performed, and we included original, English-language articles reporting cost-effectiveness or a cost-to-utility ratio or net benefits/benefit-cost focused on screening (not treatment) for conditions and genes listed by the ACMG. Articles were screened, classified as targeting a high-risk or general population, and abstracted by two reviewers. General population studies were evaluated for actual cost-effectiveness measures (e.g., incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER)), whereas studies of targeted populations were evaluated for whether at least one scenario proposed was cost-effective (e.g., ICER of ≤$100,000 per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year gained). A total of 607 studies were identified, and 32 relevant studies were included. Identified studies addressed fewer than one-third (7 of 24; 29%) of the ACMG conditions. The cost-effectiveness of screening in the general population was examined for only 2 of 24 conditions (8%). The cost-effectiveness of most genetic findings that the ACMG recommends for return has not been evaluated in economic studies or in the context of screening in the general population. The individual studies do not directly address the cost-effectiveness of WGS.

AB The PI3K/AKT pathway is the focus of several targeted therapeutic agents for a variety of malignancies. In ERBB2-amplified breast cancer, the hyperactivation of this signaling cascade is associated with resistance to ERBB2-targeted therapy. This can occur through gain-of-function alterations or compensatory mechanisms that enter into play upon pharmacological pressure. The strong rationale in combining anti-ERBB2 agents with PI3K/AKT inhibitors, together with the identification of genomic alterations conferring sensitivity to targeted inhibition, are guiding the design of clinical studies aimed at preventing the emergence of drug resistance and achieving more durable response. In the present review, we describe the involvement of this pathway in breast cancer pathogenesis, with an emphasis on AKT kinases, and provide insight into currently available targeted agents for the treatment of ERBB2-amplified breast cancer. Finally, we provide preliminary data on a novel AKT3 mutation detected in the context of resistance to anti-ERBB2 therapy as an example of genomics-based approaches towards uncovering novel actionable targets in this setting.

AB PURPOSE: Interpretation systems for clinical laboratory reporting of genetic variants for inherited conditions have been widely published. By contrast, there are no existing systems for interpretation and classification of somatic variants found from molecular testing of cancer.; METHODS: We designed an assessment protocol and classification system for somatic variants identified through next-generation sequencing molecular profiling of tumor-derived samples and applied these to a pilot dataset of somatic variants found by next-generation sequencing profiling of 158 tumor samples derived from advanced cancer patients examined at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.; RESULTS: We present a classification system to interpret the significance of genetic variants in molecular analysis of cancer, including the following key factors: (i) known or predicted pathogenicity of the variant; (ii) primary site and tumor histology in which the variant is found; (iii) recurrence of the variant; and (iv) evidence of clinical actionability. We used these factors to develop a five-category somatic variant classification for simplified reporting of variant interpretations to treating oncologists.; CONCLUSION: Our somatic variant classification can be of practical value to other clinical molecular laboratories performing cancer genetic profiling by promoting consistent reporting of somatic variants and permitting harmonization of variant data among laboratories and clinical studies.

AB PURPOSE: The prevalence of developmental disabilities in the United States is reported to be 13.87% across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Microarrays have been recommended as first-tier tests for these patients. This study reports the diagnostic yield and potential actionability of findings using a high-density chromosomal microarray (CMA).; METHODS: The diagnostic yield of CytoScan Dx Assay in 960 patients was assessed with the Riggs criteria of actionability to evaluate predicted clinical utility.; RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of the subjects were assessed using a microarray as part of historical routine patient care (RPC). The rate of pathogenic findings was similar between RPC (13.3%) and the CytoScan Dx Assay (13.8%). Among the 138 patients who did not receive microarray as RPC, the diagnostic yield for CytoScan Dx Assay was 23.9% as compared with 14.5%, indicating a 9.4% improvement when using higher-resolution methods. Thirty-five percent of patients with abnormal findings had predicted clinical management implications.; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the clinical performance of CytoScan Dx Assay. The assay's diagnostic yields are similar to those found in other studies of CMAs. Thirty-five percent of patients with abnormal findings are predicted to have clinical management implications that may improve health outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.; PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients <2 months or >12 years old.; ACTION STATEMENTS: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child <4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME. © American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2016.

AB BACKGROUND: A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a computer program that applies a set of rules to data stored in electronic health records to offer actionable recommendations. We aimed to establish whether a CDSS that supports detection of immunological treatment failure among patients with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) would improve appropriate and timely action.; METHODS: We did this prospective, cluster randomised controlled trial in adults and children (aged ≥18 months) who were eligible for, and receiving, ART at HIV clinics in Siaya County, western Kenya. Health facilities were randomly assigned (1:1), via block randomisation (block size of two) with a computer-generated random number sequence, to use electronic health records either alone (control) or with CDSS (intervention). Facilities were matched by type and by number of patients enrolled in HIV care. The primary outcome measure was the difference between groups in the proportion of patients who experienced immunological treatment failure and had a documented clinical action. We used generalised linear mixed models with random effects to analyse clustered data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01634802.; FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2012, and Jan 31, 2014, 13 clinics, comprising 41,062 patients, were randomly assigned to the control group (n=6) or the intervention group (n=7). Data collection at each site took 12 months. Among patients eligible for ART, 10,358 (99%) of 10,478 patients were receiving ART at control sites and 10,991 (99%) of 11,028 patients were receiving ART at intervention sites. Of these patients, 1125 (11%) in the control group and 1342 (12%) in the intervention group had immunological treatment failure, of whom 332 (30%) and 727 (54%), respectively, received appropriate action. The likelihood of clinicians taking appropriate action on treatment failure was higher with CDSS alerts than with no decision support system (adjusted odds ratio 3·18, 95% CI 1·02-9·87).; INTERPRETATION: CDSS significantly improved the likelihood of appropriate and timely action on immunological treatment failure. We expect our findings will be generalisable to virological monitoring of patients with HIV receiving ART once countries implement the 2015 WHO recommendation to scale up viral load monitoring.; FUNDING: US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

AB Patients with diabetes often face serious complications due to limited self-management skills, the inability to adhere to care regimens, and psychosocial factors. Although regular self-monitoring of blood glucose is known to benefit patients receiving insulin therapy, its role in patients not treated with insulin has been unclear. However, recent studies have demonstrated that structured self-monitoring of blood glucose can significantly benefit patients who are not taking insulin, facilitating improved self-awareness and clinical decision making. We hypothesize that effective self-management by patients with type 2 diabetes who do not need insulin requires a behavioural intervention that enables the association between lifestyle behaviours, such as dietary intake and physical activity, and overall glycemic control. Mobile health applications (apps), coupled with wireless medical peripheral devices, can facilitate self-monitoring; deliver tailored, actionable knowledge; elicit positive behaviour changes and promote effective self-management of diabetes. Although existing apps incorporate tracking and feedback from healthcare providers, few attempt to elicit positive behaviour changes for the purposes of developing patients' self-care skills. The purpose of this article is to present a systematic approach to the design and development a diabetes self-management mobile app, which included 1) a scoping review of literature; 2) the development of an overarching theoretical approach and 3) validation of the app features through user-centred design methods. The resulting app, bant II, facilitates 1) self-monitoring of blood glucose, physical activity, diet and weight; 2) identification of glycemic patterns in relation to lifestyle; 3) remedial decision making and 4) positive behaviour change through incentives.

AB BACKGROUND: Alarm fatigue from frequent nonactionable physiologic monitor alarms is frequently named as a threat to patient safety.; PURPOSE: To critically examine the available literature relevant to alarm fatigue.; DATA SOURCES: Articles published in English, Spanish, or French between January 1980 and April 2015 indexed in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov.; STUDY SELECTION: Articles focused on hospital physiologic monitor alarms addressing any of the following: (1) the proportion of alarms that are actionable, (2) the relationship between alarm exposure and nurse response time, and (3) the effectiveness of interventions in reducing alarm frequency.; DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data on setting, collection methods, proportion of alarms determined to be actionable, nurse response time, and associations between interventions and alarm rates.; DATA SYNTHESIS: Our search produced 24 observational studies focused on alarm characteristics and response time and 8 studies evaluating interventions. Actionable alarm proportion ranged from <1% to 36% across a range of hospital settings. Two studies showed relationships between high alarm exposure and longer nurse response time. Most intervention studies included multiple components implemented simultaneously. Although studies varied widely, and many had high risk of bias, promising but still unproven interventions include widening alarm parameters, instituting alarm delays, and using disposable electrocardiographic wires or frequently changed electrocardiographic electrodes.; CONCLUSIONS: Physiologic monitor alarms are commonly nonactionable, and evidence supporting the concept of alarm fatigue is emerging. Several interventions have the potential to reduce alarms safely, but more rigorously designed studies with attention to possible unintended consequences are needed. © 2015 Society of Hospital Medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular tumour profiling technologies have become increasingly important in the era of precision medicine, but their routine use is limited by their accessibility, cost, and tumour material availability. It is therefore crucial to assess their relative added value to optimize the sequence and combination of such technologies.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within the MOSCATO-01 trial, we investigated the added value of whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients that did not present any molecular abnormality on array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and targeted gene panel sequencing (TGPS) using cancer specific panels. The pathogenicity potential and actionability of mutations detected on WES was assessed.; RESULTS: Among 420 patients enrolled between December 2011 and December 2013, 283 (67%) patients were analysed for both TGPS and aCGH. The tumour sample of 25 (8.8%) of them presented a flat (or low-dynamic) aCGH profile and no pathogenic mutation on TGPS. We selected the first eligible 10 samples-corresponding to a heterogeneous cohort of different tumour types-to perform WES. This allowed identifying eight mutations of interest in two patients: FGFR3, PDGFRB, and CREBBP missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in an urothelial carcinoma; FGFR2, FBXW7, TP53, and MLH1 missense SNVs as well as an ATM frameshift mutation in a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The FGFR3 alteration had been previously described as an actionable activating mutation and might have resulted in treatment by an FGFR inhibitor. CREBBP and ATM alterations might also have suggested a therapeutic orientation towards epigenetic modifiers and ataxia-telangectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, respectively.; CONCLUSION: The therapeutic added value of performing WES on tumour samples that do not harbour any genetic abnormality on TGPS and aCGH might be limited and variable according to the histotype. Alternative techniques, including RNASeq and methylome analysis, might be more informative in selected cases. © The Author 2015.
