AB Introduction: Given mounting calls to disclose biomarker test results to research participants, we explored factors underlying decisions by patients with mild cognitive impairment to receive amyloid imaging results.; Methods: Prospective, qualitative interviews were conducted with 59 participants (30=mild cognitive impairment patients, 29=care partners) from the scan arm of a randomized controlled trial on the effects of amyloid PET results disclosure in an Alzheimer Disease Research Center setting.; Results: Sixty-three percent of the participants were female, with an average age of 72.9years, and most had greater than a high school level of education (80%). Primary motivations included: (1) better understanding one's mild cognitive impairment etiology and prognosis to plan ahead, and (2) learning one's brain amyloid status for knowledge's sake, regardless of whether the information is actionable. Most participants demonstrated an adequate understanding of the scan's limitations, yet instances of characterizing amyloid PET as a definitive test for Alzheimer's disease occurred. Mention of potential drawbacks, such as negative psychological outcomes, was minimal, even among care partners.; Discussion: Findings demonstrate a risk of disproportionate focus on possible benefits of testing among amyloid scan candidates and suggest a need to clearly emphasize the limitations of amyloid PET when counseling cognitively impaired patients and their families before testing. Future research should examine whether minimizing drawbacks at the pre-imaging stage has adverse consequences on results disclosure.

AB Background: The European Core Health Indicators (ECHI) are a key source of comparable health information for the European Union (EU) and its Member States (MS). The ECHI shortlist contains 88 indicators which were developed by experts from MS and international organisations. Most indicators are derived from data sources at the EU's statistical office (Eurostat), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and are available for most MS. The remaining indicators on the shortlist are at different stages of conceptual and/or methodological development. The indicators have been reviewed in the past against scientific developments, changes in data collections and emerging policy needs, yet not as part of a systematic and sustainable procedure. There is also no regular inventory of problems met by the MS in collecting the necessary data. Work package 4 of the BRIDGE Health project aimed at updating and improving the existing ECHI-indicator knowledge and expertise and at strengthening the scientific base that supports the effective development and use of health indicators for health policy evaluation and prioritization by the EU and its MS. The aim of this paper is to present a first overview of its outcomes and to explore issues concerning the ECHI data availability, content and policy relevance, update process and accessibility to stakeholders, in light of working towards a sustainable future.; Methods: Two surveys were conducted within the framework of the BRIDGE Health project to reassess the status of the ECHI shortlist. The first survey focused on data availability in EU MS, candidate countries and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. The second survey evaluated current needs and criteria with respect to content and policy relevance of the ECHI shortlist. Exploring potential new indicator topics was part of both surveys. All evaluations were supported by an advisory network of national and international experts.; Results: Of the 36 countries (EU MS, candidate and EFTA countries) contacted for the data availability mapping, 23 countries (63%) participated in the survey. Data availability from preferred data sources varied between chapters. Availability was highest for the chapter on demography and socio-economic situation, followed by the chapter on health status, where data were available for most indicators from more than 90% of the participating countries. Problems experienced by MS relating to the incorporation of ECHI into their health systems were also identified through the survey. Findings from the survey on policy relevance point at the need for strengthening the links with policy (priorities) and for exploring a possible format change of the list to accommodate actionability. It also showed support for embedding ECHI in a sustainable health information structure; this may practically be aided by a web-based single point of access to an information repository.; Conclusion: Policy relevance is an essential but not systematically developed criterion for the inclusion of indicators into the ECHI shortlist. Data availability is crucial for the actual implementation of indicators and has considerably increased for ECHI in the last decade. The data availability mapping provides a structured overview of the current status of data availability for implemented indicators. The ECHI shortlist can contribute to the collection of comparable policy-relevant health data in Europe, foster evidence-based public health and contribute to Member States learning from each other. Flexible and systematic incorporation of policy relevance in the ECHI shortlist review and revision process may substantiate ECHI as a core component of a future sustainable European health information infrastructure.

AB Clinical genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is becoming widespread. However, the interpretation of variants of unknown significance (VUS) in HBOC genes, such as the clinically actionable genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, remain a challenge. Among the variants that are frequently classified as VUS are those with unclear effects on splicing. In order to address this issue we developed a high-throughput RNA-massively parallel sequencing assay-CloneSeq-capable to perform quantitative and qualitative analysis of transcripts in cell lines and HBOC patients. This assay is based on cloning of RT-PCR products followed by massive parallel sequencing of the cloned transcripts. To validate this assay we compared it to the RNA splicing assays recommended by members of the ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles) consortium. This comparison was performed using well-characterized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) generated from carriers of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline variants that have been previously described to be associated with splicing defects. CloneSeq was able to replicate the ENIGMA results, in addition to providing quantitative characterization of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline splicing alterations in a high-throughput fashion. Furthermore, CloneSeq was used to analyze blood samples obtained from carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline sequence variants, including the novel uncharacterized alteration BRCA1 c.5152+5G>T, which was identified in a HBOC family. CloneSeq provided a high-resolution picture of all the transcripts induced by BRCA1 c.5152+5G>T, indicating it results in significant levels of exon skipping. This analysis proved to be important for the classification of BRCA1 c.5152+5G>T as a clinically actionable likely pathogenic variant. Reclassifications such as these are fundamental in order to offer preventive measures, targeted treatment, and pre-symptomatic screening to the correct individuals.

AB Leptin has central importance in the global obesity and cardiovascular disease problem. Leptin is principally secreted by adipocytes and acts in the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and food intake, increase energy expenditure, and regulate body weight. Based on clinical translation of specific and networked actions, leptin affects the cardiovascular system and may be a marker and driver of cardiometabolic risk factors with interventions that are actionable by cardiologists. Leptin subnetwork analysis demonstrates a statistically significant role for ethnoculturally and socioeconomically appropriate lifestyle intervention in cardiovascular disease. Emergent mechanistic components and potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets include hexokinase 3, urocortins, clusterin, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 6, C-reactive protein, platelet glycoprotein VI, albumin, pentraxin 3, ghrelin, obestatin prepropeptide, leptin receptor, neuropeptide Y, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1. Emergent associated symptoms include weight change, eating disorders, vascular necrosis, chronic fatigue, and chest pain. Leptin-targeted therapies are reported for lipodystrophy and leptin deficiency, but they are investigational for leptin resistance, obesity, and other chronic diseases.

AB INTRODUCTION: In the era of biomarker-driven systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC, the role of routine repeated biopsies for decision making outside EGFR-mutant disease remains unproven. We report our center's experience of safety and adequacy for molecular retesting of tumor material obtained from image-guided lung rebiopsies in NSCLC.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective case note analysis of patients undergoing image-guided lung rebiopsies at a single cancer center between 2011 and 2014. The primary objective was to determine the pathological success rate. Secondary and exploratory objectives were to determine technical success rate, histological concordance, molecular adequacy, genotypes identified, and complication rate.; RESULTS: In all, 103 patients underwent transthoracic image-guided procedures. A total of 66 rebiopsies in NSCLC were identified and analyzed. The pathological success rate was 87.1%. A high histological discordance rate was observed (12 of 52 evaluable cases [23.1%]). Pretest molecular adequacy as determined by the lung pathologist was 78.8% (52 of 66). Of 52 adequate samples 51 were sent for molecular analysis, with a total of 209 genes analyzed (including EGFR, ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene [ALK], KRAS, BRAF, dicoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene [DDR2], NRAS, ROS1, and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene gene [RET]). The rate of postgenotyping molecular adequacy was 87.1% (182 of 209). Overall, 20 new potentially actionable mutations were identified, with 13 of 66 patients (19.7%) starting to receive new targeted treatment as a result. Overall, rebiopsies informed clinical decision making in 63.6% of cases. The rates of complications were 15% for pneumothorax, 3% for pneumothorax requiring chest drain, and 8% for hemoptysis.; CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the pathological and molecular adequacy rates of rebiopsies and demonstrated clinical utility in routine decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: Medical education is a dynamic process that will continuously evolve to respond to changes in the foundations of medicine, the clinical practice of medicine and in health systems science.; PURPOSE: In this paper, we review how assessing learning in such a dynamic environment requires comprehensive flexible and adaptable methodological approaches designed to assess knowledge attainment and transfer, clinical skills/competency development, and ethical/professional behavior. Adaptive assessments should measure the learner's ability to observe where changes in health care delivery are needed and how to implement them. Balancing formative and summative assessments will promote reflective learning so that each student will reach her/his highest potential. From the programmatic perspective, measuring the design and delivery of instruction in relation to students? efforts to achieve competency will improve learning and foster continuous professional development of faculty and advance the science of learning.; APPROACH: We describe how two medical schools are approaching adaptive assessment, including using portfolio systems that encompass teaching and learning experiences while offering real-time longitudinal tracking of digital data toward improving learning and provide curricula continuous improvement cycles. Using latest technologies, portfolios produce actionable data displays with precise guidance for learning and program development.

AB In oncology, the expanding use of multi-gene panels to explore familial cancer predisposition and tumor genome analysis has led to increased secondary findings discoveries (SFs) and has given rise to important medical, ethical, and legal issues. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics published a policy statement for managing SFs for a list of genes, including 25 cancer-related genes. Currently, there are few recommendations in Europe. From June 2016 to May 2017, the French Society of Predictive and Personalized Medicine (SFMPP) established a working group of 47 experts to elaborate guidelines for managing information given on the SFs for genes related to cancers. A subgroup of ethicists, lawyers, patients' representatives, and psychologists provided ethical reflection, information guidelines, and materials (written consent form and video). A subgroup with medical expertise, including oncologists and clinical and molecular geneticists, provided independent evaluation and classification of 60 genes. The main criteria were the "actionability" of the genes (available screening or prevention strategies), the risk evaluation (severity, penetrance, and age of disease onset), and the level of evidence from published data. Genes were divided into three classes: for class 1 genes (n=36), delivering the information on SFs was recommended; for class 2 genes (n=5), delivering the information remained questionable because of insufficient data from the literature and/or level of evidence; and for class 3 genes (n=19), delivering the information on SFs was not recommended. These guidelines for managing SFs for cancer-predisposing genes provide new insights for clinicians and laboratories to standardize clinical practices.

AB Purpose Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most deadly form of breast cancer (BC) today. TNBC treatment is fraught with challenges because of the extensive interpatient heterogeneity in clinical behavior and scarcity of stratifying biomarkers and actionable targets. Women of African ancestry face a disproportionate burden resulting from this disease, which affects them earlier and more aggressively and has a higher propensity to spread and resist conventional treatments. A much higher proportion of Nigerian patients with BC have TNBC compared with patients with BC in the United States and Europe. Methods This article spotlights Nigeria as an example of a nation wherein genetic and nongenetic spheres of influence intersect to affect the prevalence of this disease, the scale of its challenge, and its toll. Results Studies have illuminated the inherently different tumor biology of Nigerian TNBCs, which show distinct genetic variants and gene expression patterns compared with European or European-American TNBCs. Parallels are apparent between TNBC phenotypes among African Americans and Nigerians, implicating the common thread of shared genetic ancestry between these populations. Reproductive, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and cultural factors also shape TNBC outcomes in Nigeria, as do resource constraints in Nigerian health care and research sectors. Conclusion Increasing our understanding of how these factors contribute to poorer outcomes among Nigerian women may uncover valuable insights and strategies in alleviating the TNBC burden in many countries of the world and help reduce the racial disparity in BC-related outcomes here in the United States. Importantly, this review also highlights collaborative global and local initiatives that converge expertise and resources to advance research on effective management of TNBC in diverse populations.

AB Although programmed death-ligand 1-programmed death 1 (PD-L1-PD-1) inhibitors are broadly efficacious, improved outcomes have been observed in patients with high PD-L1 expression or high tumor mutational burden (TMB). PD-L1 testing is required for checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in front-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, obtaining adequate tumor tissue for molecular testing in patients with advanced disease can be challenging. Thus, an unmet medical need exists for diagnostic approaches that do not require tissue to identify patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Here, we describe a novel, technically robust, blood-based assay to measure TMB in plasma (bTMB) that is distinct from tissue-based approaches. Using a retrospective analysis of two large randomized trials as test and validation studies, we show that bTMB reproducibly identifies patients who derive clinically significant improvements in progression-free survival from atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1) in second-line and higher NSCLC. Collectively, our data show that high bTMB is a clinically actionable biomarker for atezolizumab in NSCLC.

AB Context: Pituitary carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis and few effective treatment options.; Case: A 35-year-old woman presented with an aggressive ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma that initially responded to concurrent temozolomide and capecitabine prior to metastasizing to the liver. Following treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, the tumor volume of the dominant liver metastasis reduced by 92%, and the recurrent intracranial disease regressed by 59%. Simultaneously, her plasma ACTH level decreased from 45,550 pg/mL to 66 pg/mL.; Molecular Evaluation: Both prospective clinical sequencing with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets and retrospective whole-exome sequencing were performed to characterize the molecular alterations in the chemotherapy-naive pituitary adenoma and the temozolomide-resistant liver metastasis. The liver metastasis harbored a somatic mutational burden consistent with alkylator-induced hypermutation that was absent from the treatment-naive tumor. Resistance to temozolomide treatment, acquisition of new oncogenic drivers, and subsequent sensitivity to immunotherapy may be attributed to hypermutation.; Conclusion: Combination treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab may be an effective treatment in pituitary carcinoma. Clinical sequencing of pituitary tumors that have relapsed following treatment with conventional chemotherapy may identify the development of therapy-induced somatic hypermutation, which may be associated with treatment response to immunotherapy.

AB OBJECTIVES: To propose collective well-being as a holistic measure of the overall "health" of a community. To define collective well-being as a group-level construct measured across 5 domains (vitality, opportunity, connectedness, contribution, and inspiration) and introduce an actionable model that demonstrates how community characteristics affect collective well-being. To review the literature describing each domain's association with health outcomes and community characteristics' associations with collective well-being.; METHODS: We came to consensus on topics describing each component of our conceptual model. Because "well-being" is not indexed in MEDLINE, we performed topic-specific database searches and examined bibliographies of papers retrieved. We excluded articles that were limited to narrow subtopics or studies within small subpopulations. Preference was given to quasi-experimental or randomized studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. Consensus was reached on inclusion or exclusion of all articles.; RESULTS: Reviewed literature supported each of the proposed domains as important aspects of collective well-being and as determinants of individual or community health. Evidence suggests a broad range of community characteristics support collective well-being.; CONCLUSIONS: The health and quality of life of a community may be improved by focusing efforts on community characteristics that support key aspects of well-being. Future work should develop a unified measure of collective well-being to evaluate the relative impact of specific efforts on the collective well-being of communities.

AB BACKGROUND: Thoracic aortic aneurysms progressively enlarge and predispose to acute aortic dissections. Up to 25% of individuals with thoracic aortic disease harbor an underlying Mendelian pathogenic variant. An evidence-based strategy for selection of genes to test in hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (HTAAD) helps inform family screening and intervention to prevent life-threatening thoracic aortic events.; OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to accurately identify genes that predispose to HTAAD using the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) framework.; METHODS: We applied the semiquantitative ClinGen framework to assess presumed gene-disease relationships between 53 candidate genes and HTAAD. Genes were classified as causative for HTAAD if they were associated with isolated thoracic aortic disease and were clinically actionable, triggering routine aortic surveillance, intervention, and family cascade screening. All gene-disease assertions were evaluated by a pre-defined curator-expert pair and subsequently discussed with an expert panel.; RESULTS: Genes were classified based on the strength of association with HTAAD into 5 categories: definitive (n=9), strong (n=2), moderate (n=4), limited (n=15), and no reported evidence (n=23). They were further categorized by severity of associated aortic disease and risk of progression. Eleven genes in the definitive and strong groups were designated as "HTAAD genes" (category A). Eight genes were classified as unlikely to be progressive (category B) and 4 as low risk (category C). The remaining genes were recent genes with an uncertain classification or genes with no evidence of association with HTAAD.; CONCLUSIONS: The ClinGen framework is useful to semiquantitatively assess the strength of gene-disease relationships for HTAAD. Gene categories resulting from the curation may inform clinical laboratories in the development, interpretation, and subsequent clinical implications of genetic testing for patients with aortic disease.

AB Allele Drop out (ADO) arising from non-amplification of one allele may produce false negative result and impact clinical management. In cancer, germline and somatic genetic analysis is being increasingly used but the prevalence, nature and implications of ADO has not been studied in any cohort. In a cohort of 290 Li Fraumeni/Li Fraumeni Like Syndrome cases undergoing TP53 genetic testing, of the 69 pathogenic mutations identified so far, 5 were initially missed and 4 were misgenotyped as homozygous mutation due to germline ADO. Of the 9 germline ADOs, 8 were sequence dependent, arising from a polymorphism (rs12951053) in the primer annealing region of exon 7. Of 35 somatic TP53 variants identified by exome sequencing in 50 oral cancer tissues registered under International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), as a result of ADO, 4 were not detectable and 6 were not called as variant on Sanger Sequencing due to low peak height. High prevalence of germline and somatic ADO in the most frequently mutated cancer gene TP53, highlights the need for systematic evaluation of ADO prevalence and causes in clinically important cancer genes. False negative result for high penetrance germline mutations or actionable somatic mutations in oncogenes could have major clinical implications.

AB BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in 32 cancer susceptibility genes in individuals with newly diagnosed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A key secondary objective was to evaluate how often PGVs would have been undetected with existing genetic testing criteria.; METHODS: From May 2016 through May 2017, this multicenter cohort study enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 to 89 years with histologically confirmed PDAC diagnosed within the previous 12 weeks. Demographics, medical histories, and 3-generation pedigrees were collected from participants who provided samples for germline DNA analysis.; RESULTS: Four hundred nineteen patients were deemed eligible, 302 were enrolled, and 298 were included in the final cohort. Clinically actionable variants were reported in 29 PDAC patients (9.7%), with 23 (7.7%) having a PGV associated with an increased risk for PDAC. Six of 23 individuals (26%) with PDAC-associated gene mutations did not meet currently established genetic testing criteria. According to guideline-based genetic testing, only 11 of the 23 PGVs (48%) in known PDAC genes would have been detected. Six additional patients (2%) had PGVs associated with an increased risk for other cancers.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the significant prevalence of PGVs associated with PDAC and the limitations of current paradigms for selecting patients for genetic testing, and they thereby lend support for universal germline multigene genetic testing in this population. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

AB PURPOSE: Advanced-stage endometrial cancers have limited treatment options and poor prognosis, highlighting the need to understand genetic drivers of therapeutic vulnerabilities and/or prognostic predictors. We examined whether prospective molecular characterization of recurrent and metastatic disease can reveal grade and histology-specific differences, facilitating enrollment onto clinical trials.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We integrated prospective clinical sequencing and IHC data with detailed clinical and treatment histories for 197 tumors, profiled by MSK-IMPACT from 189 patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.; RESULTS: Patients had advanced disease and high-grade histologies, with poor progression-free survival on first-line therapy (PFS1). When matched for histology and grade, the genomic landscape was similar to that of primary untreated disease profiled by TCGA. Using multiple complementary genomic and mutational signature-based methods, we identified patients with microsatellite instability (MSI), even when standard MMR protein IHC staining failed. Tumor and matched normal DNA sequencing identified rare pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA2 and MLH1. Clustering the pattern of DNA copy-number alterations revealed a novel subset characterized by heterozygous losses across the genome and significantly worse outcomes compared with other clusters (median PFS1 9.6 months vs. 17.0 and 17.4 months; P = 0.006). Of the 68% of patients harboring potentially actionable mutations, 27% were enrolled to matched clinical trials, of which 47% of these achieved clinical benefit.; CONCLUSIONS: Prospective clinical sequencing of advanced endometrial cancer can help refine prognosis and aid treatment decision making by simultaneously detecting microsatellite status, germline predisposition syndromes, and potentially actionable mutations. A small overall proportion of all patients tested received investigational, genomically matched therapy as part of clinical trials. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB The global burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing and might soon surpass an annual incidence of 1 million cases. Genomic studies have established the landscape of molecular alterations in HCC; however, the most common mutations are not actionable, and only ~25% of tumours harbour potentially targetable drivers. Despite the fact that surveillance programmes lead to early diagnosis in 40-50% of patients, at a point when potentially curative treatments are applicable, almost half of all patients with HCC ultimately receive systemic therapies. Sorafenib was the first systemic therapy approved for patients with advanced-stage HCC, after a landmark study revealed an improvement in median overall survival from 8 to 11 months. New drugs - lenvatinib in the frontline and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab in the second line - have also been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes, although the median overall survival remains ~1 year; thus, therapeutic breakthroughs are still needed. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors are now being incorporated into the HCC treatment armamentarium and combinations of molecularly targeted therapies with immunotherapies are emerging as tools to boost the immune response. Research on biomarkers of a response or primary resistance to immunotherapies is also advancing. Herein, we summarize the molecular targets and therapies for the management of HCC and discuss the advancements expected in the near future, including biomarker-driven treatments and immunotherapies.

AB Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are uncommon cancers arising from pancreatic islet cells. Here we report the analysis of gene mutation, copy number, and RNA expression of 57 sporadic well-differentiated pNETs. pNET genomes are dominated by aneuploidy, leading to concordant changes in RNA expression at the level of whole chromosomes and chromosome segments. We observed two distinct patterns of somatic pNET aneuploidy that are associated with tumor pathology and patient prognosis. Approximately 26% of the patients in this series had pNETs with genomes characterized by recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LoH) of 10 specific chromosomes, accompanied by bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation and generally poor clinical outcome. Another ~40% of patients had pNETs that lacked this recurrent LoH pattern but had chromosome 11 LoH, bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation, and universally good clinical outcome. The somatic aneuploidy allowed pathogenic germline variants (e.g., ATM) to be expressed unopposed, with RNA expression patterns showing inactivation of downstream tumor suppressor pathways. No prognostic associations were found with tumor morphology, single gene mutation, or expression of RNAs reflecting the activity of immune, differentiation, proliferative or tumor suppressor pathways. In pNETs, single gene mutations appear to be less important than aneuploidy, with MEN1 the only statistically significant recurrently mutated driver gene. In addition, only one pNET in the series had clearly actionable single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (in PTEN and FLCN) confirmed by corroborating RNA expression changes. The two clinically relevant patterns of LoH described here define a novel oncogenic mechanism and a plausible route to genomic precision oncology for this tumor type.

AB Vaccines and other alternative products can help minimize the need for antibiotics by preventing and controlling infectious diseases in animal populations, and are central to the future success of animal agriculture. To assess scientific advancements related to alternatives to antibiotics and provide actionable strategies to support their development, the United States Department of Agriculture, with support from the World Organisation for Animal Health, organized the second International Symposium on Alternatives to Antibiotics. It focused on six key areas: vaccines; microbial-derived products; non-nutritive phytochemicals; immune-related products; chemicals, enzymes, and innovative drugs; and regulatory pathways to enable the development and licensure of alternatives to antibiotics. This article, part of a two-part series, synthesizes and expands on the expert panel discussions regarding opportunities, challenges and needs for the development of vaccines that may reduce the need for use of antibiotics in animals; new approaches and potential solutions will be discussed in part 2 of this series. Vaccines are widely used to prevent infections in food animals. Various studies have demonstrated that their animal agricultural use can lead to significant reductions in antibiotic consumption, making them promising alternatives to antibiotics. To be widely used in food producing animals, vaccines have to be safe, effective, easy to use, and cost-effective. Many current vaccines fall short in one or more of these respects. Scientific advancements may allow many of these limitations to be overcome, but progress is funding-dependent. Research will have to be prioritized to ensure scarce public resources are dedicated to areas of potentially greatest impact first, and private investments into vaccine development constantly compete with other investment opportunities. Although vaccines have the potential to improve animal health, safeguard agricultural productivity, and reduce antibiotic consumption and resulting resistance risks, targeted research and development investments and concerted efforts by all affected are needed to realize that potential.

AB Due to the continuing global concerns involving antibiotic resistance, there is a need for scientific forums to assess advancements in the development of antimicrobials and their alternatives that might reduce development and spread of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens. The objectives of the 2nd International Symposium on Alternatives to Antibiotics were to highlight promising research results and novel technologies that can provide alternatives to antibiotics for use in animal health and production, assess challenges associated with their authorization and commercialization for use, and provide actionable strategies to support their development. The session on microbial-derived products was directed at presenting novel technologies that included exploiting CRISPR-Cas nucleases to produce sequence-specific antimicrobials, probiotics development via fecal microbiome transplants among monogastric production animals such as chickens and mining microbial sources such as bacteria or yeast to identify new antimicrobial compounds. Other research has included continuing development of antimicrobial peptides such as newly discovered bacteriocins as alternatives to antibiotics, use of bacteriophages accompanied by development of unique lytic proteins with specific cell-wall binding domains and novel approaches such as microbial-ecology guided discovery of anti-biofilm compounds discovered in marine environments. The symposium was held at the Headquarters of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in Paris, France during 12-15 December 2016.

To assess scientific advancements related to alternatives to antibiotics and provide actionable strategies to support their development, the United States Department of Agriculture, with support from the World Organisation for Animal Health, organized the second International Symposium on Alternatives to Antibiotics.

This article, the second part in a two-part series, highlights new approaches and potential solutions for the development of vaccines as alternatives to antibiotics in food producing animals; opportunities, challenges and needs for the development of such vaccines are discussed in the first part of this series. As discussed in part 1 of this manuscript, many current vaccines fall short of ideal vaccines in one or more respects. Promising breakthroughs to overcome these limitations include new biotechnology techniques, new oral vaccine approaches, novel adjuvants, new delivery strategies based on bacterial spores, and live recombinant vectors; they also include new vaccination strategies in-ovo, and strategies that simultaneously protect against multiple pathogens. However, translating this research into commercial vaccines that effectively reduce the need for antibiotics will require close collaboration among stakeholders, for instance through public-private partnerships. Targeted research and development investments and concerted efforts by all affected are needed to realize the potential of vaccines to improve animal health, safeguard agricultural productivity, and reduce antibiotic consumption and resulting resistance risks.

AB There are heightened concerns globally on emerging drug-resistant superbugs and the lack of new antibiotics for treating human and animal diseases. For the agricultural industry, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to replace antibiotics for food-producing animals, especially poultry and livestock. The 2nd International Symposium on Alternatives to Antibiotics was held at the World Organization for Animal Health in Paris, France, December 12-15, 2016 to discuss recent scientific developments on strategic antibiotic-free management plans, to evaluate regional differences in policies regarding the reduction of antibiotics in animal agriculture and to develop antibiotic alternatives to combat the global increase in antibiotic resistance. More than 270 participants from academia, government research institutions, regulatory agencies, and private animal industries from >25 different countries came together to discuss recent research and promising novel technologies that could provide alternatives to antibiotics for use in animal health and production; assess challenges associated with their commercialization; and devise actionable strategies to facilitate the development of alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) without hampering animal production. The 3-day meeting consisted of four scientific sessions including vaccines, microbial products, phytochemicals, immune-related products, and innovative drugs, chemicals and enzymes, followed by the last session on regulation and funding. Each session was followed by an expert panel discussion that included industry representatives and session speakers. The session on phytochemicals included talks describing recent research achievements, with examples of successful agricultural use of various phytochemicals as antibiotic alternatives and their mode of action in major agricultural animals (poultry, swine and ruminants). Scientists from industry and academia and government research institutes shared their experience in developing and applying potential antibiotic-alternative phytochemicals commercially to reduce AGPs and to develop a sustainable animal production system in the absence of antibiotics.

AB BACKGROUND: The built and natural environment and health are inextricably linked. However, there is considerable debate surrounding the strength and quality of the evidence base underpinning principles of good practice for built and natural environment design in promoting health. This umbrella review aimed to assess relationships between the built and natural environment and health, concentrating on five topic areas: neighbourhood design, housing, food environment, natural and sustainable environment, and transport.; METHODS: A structured search was conducted for quantitative systematic reviews and stakeholder reviews published between January 2005 and April 2016. Seven databases and the websites of 15 relevant and respected stakeholder organisations known to publish review-level documentation were searched. Searches were limited to English-language publications and duplicate references were removed. Evidence quality and strength was appraised using validated techniques. Findings were used to develop a diagram for each topic area, illustrating relationships between built and natural environment planning principles and health-related outcomes.; RESULTS: A total of 117 systematic reviews and review-level documents were eligible for inclusion. The quality of evidence was mixed; much of the evidence examined relied on findings from cross-sectional studies, making it difficult to draw clear causal links between built environment exposures and health-related impacts and outcomes. Fourteen actionable planning principles associated with positive health-related outcomes were identified across the five topic areas. For example, neighbourhoods that enhanced walkability, were complete and compact in design, and those which enhanced connectivity through safe and efficient infrastructure were associated with better health-related outcomes relating to physical activity, social engagement, mental health, perceptions of crime, and road traffic collisions. Evidence for the effectiveness of planning principles across different topic areas and on reducing health inequalities was sparse and inconclusive.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide an up-to-date overview of relationships between the built and natural environment and health and present logical, evidence-based messages to aid communication between public health and planning professionals.

AB Endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) is the commonest form of endometrial cancer and can be divided into estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative subtypes. The mutational profiles of EEC have been shown to aid in tailoring treatment; however, little is known about the differences between the gene mutation profiles between these two subtypes. This study aims to investigate the gene mutation profile in ER positive and negative EEC, and to further elucidate the role of WHSC1 mutations in this cancer. EEC and normal endometrial tissues were obtained from 29 patients and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) using Ion Ampliseq Comprehensive Cancer PanelTM targeting 409 cancer related. A total of 741 non-synonymous alterations were identified from 272 genes in ER positive subtype while 448 non-synonymous variants were identified from 221 genes in ER negative subtype. PTEN is the most frequently altered gene in ER positive subtype (64%, 7/11) while ARID1A is the most frequently altered gene in ER negative subtype (50%, 4/8). We also identified alterations in ERRB3 (36%, 4/11), GNAS (36%, 4/11), and WHSC1 (27%, 3/11) in the ER positive subtype. WHSC1 R1126H and L1268P were shown to significantly increase cell viability, proliferation, migration, and survival. In addition, reduction in ER expression sensitized EEC-1 cell with WHSC1 L1268P mutant to Fulvestrant treatment. We revealed the mutational spectra of ER positive and ER negative EEC that could lead to better understanding of the biological mechanisms of endometrial cancer and may ultimately result in improvement of treatment options and patient prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Before the availability of immunotherapy, chemotherapy was standard first-line therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking actionable gene alterations. Preclinical evidence suggests chemotherapy is immunomodulatory, supporting chemotherapy/immunotherapy combinations. Atezolizumab, anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody, blocks programmed cell death protein-1 and B7.1 interaction with PD-L1. GP28328 (NCT01633970) assessed atezolizumab with chemotherapy in multiple tumours; we report results for advanced, treatment-naive NSCLC.; METHODS: Patients received atezolizumab plus carboplatin with paclitaxel (Arm C: atezo/cb/pac), pemetrexed (Arm D: atezo/cb/pem, maintenance pemetrexed permitted), or nab-paclitaxel (Arm E: atezo/cb/nab-pac), four-six cycles, then atezolizumab maintenance. Primary end-point was safety; secondary end-points were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS)and overall survival (OS).; RESULTS: Seventy-six NSCLC patients were enrolled (n=25, 25and 26 for Arms C, Dand E, respectively). Common treatment-related grade III/IV adverse events were neutropenia (36% atezo/cb/pac, 36% atezo/cb/pem, 42% atezo/cb/nab-pac) and anaemia (16% atezo/cb/pac, 16% atezo/cb/pem, 31% atezo/cb/nab-pac). Confirmed ORRs were 36% atezo/cb/pac, 68% atezo/cb/pem (one complete response [CR])and 46% atezo/cb/nab-pac (four CRs). Median PFS was 7.1 months, (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2-8.3), 8.4 months (95% CI: 4.7-11)and 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.4-14.8), respectively. Median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI: 8.8-21.3), 18.9 months (95% CI: 9.9-27.4)and 17.0 months (95% CI: 12.7-not evaluable), respectively.; CONCLUSION: Atezolizumab with chemotherapy was well tolerated with encouraging efficacy, though the analysis was limited by small numbers. NSCLC chemotherapy combination studies are ongoing. CLINICALTRIALS.; GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01633970. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This commentary calls for a broader conceptualization of the healthcare system and proposes a health systems performance framework that will guide reconciliation and health system improvements in northern, Indigenous and rural communities. Reconciliation provides an opportunity to develop more reciprocal approaches to performance framework and indicator development in Indigenous and northern regions. An enhanced performance framework will inform management that is underpinned by policies and actionable strategies that build on evidence and Indigenous knowledge to inform health systems improvements. Performance measurement systems rooted in reconciliation and based on Indigenous values enable us to have a deeper understanding of system drivers and the legislation and policy levers that perpetuate health inequities. © 2018 Longwoods Publishing.

AB Many cancer treatments are associated with serious side effects, while they often only benefit a subset of the patients. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for tools that can aid in selecting the right treatment at diagnosis. Here we introduce simulated treatment learning (STL), which enables prediction of a patient's treatment benefit. STL uses the idea that patients who received different treatments, but have similar genetic tumor profiles, can be used to model their response to the alternative treatment. We apply STL to two multiple myeloma gene expression datasets, containing different treatments (bortezomib and lenalidomide). We find that STL can predict treatment benefit for both; a twofold progression free survival (PFS) benefit is observed for bortezomib for 19.8% and a threefold PFS benefit for lenalidomide for 31.1% of the patients. This demonstrates that STL can derive clinically actionable gene expression signatures that enable a more personalized approach to treatment.

AB The discourse in healthcare Knowledge Mobilisation (KMb) literature has shifted from simple, linear models of research knowledge production and action to more iterative and complex models. These aim to blend multiple stakeholders' knowledge with research knowledge to address the research-practice gap. It has been suggested there is no 'magic bullet', but that a promising approach to take is knowledge co-creation in healthcare, particularly if a number of principles are applied. These include systems thinking, positioning research as a creative enterprise with human experience at its core, and paying attention to process within the partnership. This discussion paper builds on this proposition and extends it beyond knowledge co-creation to co-designing evidenced based interventions and implementing them. Within a co-design model, we offer a specific approach to share, mobilise and activate knowledge, that we have termed 'collective making'. We draw on KMb, design, wider literature, and our experiences to describe how this framework supports and extends the principles of co-creation offered by Geenhalgh et al. [1] in the context of the state of the art of knowledge mobilisation. We describe how collective making creates the right 'conditions' for knowledge to be mobilised particularly addressing issues relating to stakeholder relationships, helps to discover, share and blend different forms of knowledge from different stakeholders, and puts this blended knowledge to practical use allowing stakeholders to learn about the practical implications of knowledge use and to collectively create actionable products. We suggest this collective making has three domains of influence: on the participants; on the knowledge discovered and shared; and on the mobilisation or activation of this knowledge.

AB BACKGROUND: Usability flaws in medication alerting systems may have a negative impact on clinical use and patient safety. In order to prevent the release of alerting systems that contain such flaws, it is necessary to provide designers and evaluators with evidence-based usability design principles. The objective of the present study was to develop a comprehensive, structured list of evidence-based usability design principles for medication alerting systems.; METHODS: Nine sets of design principles for medication alerting systems were analyzed, summarized, and structured. We then matched the summarized principles with a list of usability flaws in order to determine the level of underlying evidence.; RESULTS: Fifty-eight principles were summarized from the literature and two additional principles were defined, so that each flaw was matched with a principle. We organized the 60 summarized usability design principles into 6 meta-principles, 38 principles, and 16 sub-principles. Only 15 principles were not matched with a usability flaw. The 6 meta-principles respectively covered the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio, the support for collaborative working, the fit with a clinician's workflow, the data display, the transparency of the alerting system, and the actionable tools to be provided within an alert.; CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to develop an evidence-based, structured, comprehensive list of usability design principles that are specific to medication alerting systems and are illustrated by the corresponding usability flaws. This list represents an improvement over the current literature. Each principle is now associated with the best available evidence of its violation. This knowledge may help to improve the usability of medication alerting systems and, ultimately, decrease the harmful consequences of the systems' usability flaws.

AB Adaptation of tumor cells to radiotherapy induces changes that are actionable by molecular targeted agents and immunotherapy. This report demonstrates that radiation-induced changes in integrin expression can be targeted 2 months later. Integrins are transmembrane cell adhesion molecules that are essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation. To analyze the short- and long-term effects of radiation on the integrin expression, prostate cancer cells (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP) were cultured in a 3D extracellular matrix and irradiated with either a single dose of radiation (2-10 Gy) or a multifractionated regimen (2-10 fractions of 1 Gy). Whole human genome microarrays, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and immunofluorescence staining of integrins were performed. The results were confirmed in a prostate cancer xenograft model system. Interestingly, beta1 and beta4 integrins (ITGB1 and ITGB4) were upregulated after radiation in vitro and in vivo. This overexpression lasted for more than 2 months and was dose dependent. Moreover, radiation-induced upregulation of beta1 and beta4 integrin resulted in significantly increased tumor cell death after treatment with inhibitory antibodies. Combined, these findings indicate that long-term tumor adaptation to radiation can result in an increased susceptibility of surviving cancer cells to molecular targeted therapy due to a radiation-induced overexpression of the target. IMPLICATIONS: Radiation induces dose- and schedule-dependent adaptive changes that are targetable for an extended time; thus suggesting radiotherapy as a unique strategy to orchestrate molecular processes, thereby providing new radiation-drug treatment options within precision cancer medicine. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Despite the known health and economic benefits of medications, nonadherence remains a significant, yet entirely preventable public health burden. Over decades, there have been numerous research studies evaluating health interventions and policy efforts aimed at improving adherence, yet no universal or consistently high impact solutions have been identified. At present, new challenges and opportunities in policy and the movement toward value-based care should foster an environment that appreciates adherence as a mechanism to improve health outcomes and control costs (eg, fewer hospitalizations, reduced health care utilization). Our objective was to provide a commentary on recent changes in the landscape of research and health policy directed toward improving adherence and an actionable agenda to achieve system level savings and improved health by harnessing the benefits of medications. Specifically, we address the complementary perspectives of precision medicine and population health management; integrating data sources to develop innovative measurement of adherence and target adherence interventions; and behavioral economics to determine appropriate incentives.

AB OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to explain why two siblings carrying both the same homozygous pathogenic mutation for the autoinflammatory disease hyper IgD syndrome, show opposite phenotypes, that is, the first being asymptomatic, the second presenting all classical characteristics of the disease.; METHODS: Where single omics (mainly exome) analysis fails to identify culprit genes/mutations in human complex diseases, multiomics analyses may provide solutions, although this has been seldom used in a clinical setting. Here we combine exome, transcriptome and proteome analyses to decipher at a molecular level, the phenotypic differences between the two siblings.; RESULTS: This multiomics approach led to the identification of a single gene-STAT1-which harboured a rare missense variant and showed a significant overexpression of both mRNA and protein in the symptomatic versus the asymptomatic sister. This variant was shown to be of gain of function nature, involved in an increased activation of the Janus kinase/signaltransducer and activator of transcription signalling (JAK/STAT) pathway, known to play a critical role in inflammatory diseases and for which specific biotherapies presently exist. Pathway analyses based on information from differentially expressed transcripts and proteins confirmed the central role of STAT1 in the proposed regulatory network leading to an increased inflammatory phenotype in the symptomatic sibling.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the power of a multiomics approach to uncover potential clinically actionable targets for a personalised therapy. In more general terms, we provide a proteogenomics analysis pipeline that takes advantage of subject-specific genomic and transcriptomic information to improve protein identification and hence advance individualised medicine. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

AB Diagnostic whole-exome sequencing has proven highly successful in a range of rare diseases, particularly early-onset genetic conditions. In more common conditions, however, exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes remains the exception. Here we describe a patient initially diagnosed with a common, complex liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who was determined to have Wilson disease (WD) upon research-related exome sequencing. The patient presented as a 14.5-yr-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin, and histologic examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. He was enrolled in a large longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD and was found to have WD by exome sequencing performed 4 yr later. This new diagnosis, confirmed clinically by 24 h urine copper quantification, led to a change in the therapy from lifestyle counseling to directed treatment with d-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis and thereby choosing the appropriate treatment was increased by exome sequencing and careful interpretation. This example illustrates the utility of exome sequencing diagnostically in more common conditions not currently considered as targets for genome-wide evaluation and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common conditions often in fact have rarer genetically determined syndromes that have escaped clinical detection. © 2018 Wattacheril et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Traditional methods of health surveillance often under-represent racial and ethnic minorities. Our objective was to use geospatial analysis and emergency claims data to estimate local chronic disease prevalence separately for specific racial and ethnic groups. We also performed a regression analysis to identify associations between median household income and local disease prevalence among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White adults in New York City. The study population included individuals who visited an emergency department at least once from 2009 to 2013. Our main outcomes were geospatial estimates of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma prevalence by Census tract as stratified by race and ethnicity. Using emergency claims data, we identified 4.9 million unique New York City adults with 28.5% of identifying as Black, 25.2% Hispanic, and 6.1% Asian. Age-adjusted disease prevalence was highest among Black and Hispanic adults for diabetes (13.4 and 13.1%), hypertension (28.7 and 24.1%), and asthma (9.9 and 10.1%). Correlation between disease prevalence maps demonstrated moderate overlap between Black and Hispanic adults for diabetes (0.49), hypertension (0.57), and asthma (0.58). In our regression analysis, we found that the association between low income and high disease prevalence was strongest for Hispanic adults, whereas increases in income had more modest reductions in disease prevalence for Black adults, especially for diabetes. Our geographically detailed maps of disease prevalence generate actionable evidence that can help direct health interventions to those communities with the highest health disparities. Using these novel geographic approaches, we reveal the underlying epidemiology of chronic disease for a racially and culturally diverse population.

AB BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, implementation research and a science of global health delivery have emerged as important vehicles to improve the effectiveness of interventions. Efforts to control neglected tropical diseases (NTD) operate in challenging circumstances and with marginalized populations, making attention to context-specific details particularly relevant. Socio-anthropological insights have much to offer a science of NTD delivery. In this paper, an accessible and actionable framework for understanding NTD intervention effectiveness, based on socio-anthropological research, is presented and its utility for program planning and monitoring and evaluation is outlined.; METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The framework was developed inductively by comparatively analyzing three rapid ethnographic studies undertaken in Eastern Africa (2010-2013) on three different large-scale NTD interventions: rabies elimination in Tanzania, sleeping sickness control in Uganda and the prevention of parasitic worms in Zambia. The framework includes five "intervention domains" where the effectiveness of these interventions was negotiated and determined at the local level. This involves: 1) the terrain of intervention (including seasonality and geographical variability); 2) community agency (including local knowledge, risk perceptions, behaviors, leadership and social pressure); 3) the strategies and incentives of field staff (skills, motivations, capabilities and support); 4) the socio-materiality of technology (characteristics of intervention tools and the adoption process itself); and 5) the governance of interventions (policy narratives, available expertise, bureaucracy, politics and the utilization of knowledge). The paper illustrates the importance of each of these domains by drawing on the case study research, presenting lessons learnt and practical recommendations for how such insights could improve intervention delivery.; CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To help close the gap between efficacy and effectiveness in NTD programs, it is important that field staff: 1) generate meaningful knowledge about contextual factors; 2) use this knowledge to tailor field strategies; and 3) create routine mechanisms to account for the dynamic process of implementation itself. The framework presented here offers a simple analytical tool to strengthen these knowledge-to-action relationships existing project planning tools, drawing on the insights of socio-anthropology.

AB Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a common adult soft tissue sarcoma characterized by an infiltrative growth pattern and a high local recurrence rate. Here we report the genetic and epigenetic landscape of MFS based on the results of whole-exome sequencing (N=41), RNA sequencing (N=29), and methylation analysis (N=41), using 41 MFSs as a discovery set, and subsequent targeted sequencing of 140 genes in the entire cohort of 99 MFSs and 17 MFSs' data from TCGA. Fourteen driver genes are identified, including potentially actionable therapeutic targets seen in 37% of cases. There are frequent alterations in p53 signaling (51%) and cell cycle checkpoint genes (43%). Other conceivably actionable driver genes including ATRX, JAK1, NF1, NTRK1, and novel oncogenic BRAF fusion gene are identified. Methylation patterns cluster into three subtypes associated with unique combinations of driver mutations, clinical outcomes, and immune cell compositions. Our results provide a valuable genomic resource to enable the design of precision medicine for MFS.

AB Biomedical data sets are becoming increasingly larger and a plethora of high-dimensionality data sets ("Big Data") are now freely accessible for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. It is thus important that new informatic analysis platforms are developed that allow the organization and interrogation of Big Data resources into a rational and actionable mechanism for advanced therapeutic development. This will entail the generation of systems and tools that allow the cross-platform correlation between data sets of distinct types, for example, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest strategies, including latent semantic analytics, topological data investigation, and deep learning techniques that will drive the future development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications for Alzheimer's disease. We contend that diverse informatic "Big Data" platforms should be synergistically designed with more advanced chemical/drug and cellular/tissue-based phenotypic analytical predictive models to assist in either de novo drug design or effective drug repurposing.

AB BACKGROUND: The nature and consequences of patient and family emotional harm stemming from preventable medical error, such as losing a loved one or surviving serious medical injury, is poorly understood. Patients and families, clinicians, social scientists, lawyers, and foundation/policy leaders were brought together to establish research priorities for this issue.; METHODS: A one-day conference of diverse stakeholder groups to establish a consensus-driven research agenda focused on (1) priorities for research on the short-term and long-term emotional impact of harmful events on patients and families, (2) barriers and enablers to conducting such research, and (3) actionable steps toward better supporting harmed patients and families now.; RESULTS: Stakeholders discussed patient and family experiences after serious harmful events, including profound isolation, psychological distress, damaging aspects of medical culture, health care aversion, and negative effects on communities. Stakeholder groups reached consensus, defining four research priorities: (1) Establish conceptual framework and patient-centered taxonomy of harm and healing; (2) Describe epidemiology of emotional harm; (3) Determine how to make emotional harm and long-term impacts visible to health care organizations and society at large; and (4) Develop and implement best practices for emotional support of patients and families. The group also created a strategy for overcoming research barriers and actionable "Do Now" approaches to improve the patient and family experience while research is ongoing.; CONCLUSION: Emotional and other long-term impacts of harmful events can have profound consequences for patients and families. Stakeholders designed a path forward to inform approaches that better support harmed patients and families, with both immediately actionable and longer-term research strategies. Copyright © 2018.

AB Non-invasive wearable biosensors provide real-time, continuous, and actionable health information. However, difficulties detecting diluted biomarkers in excreted biofluids limit practical applications. Most biomarkers of interest are transported paracellularly into excreted biofluids from biomarker-rich blood and interstitial fluid during normal modulation of cellular tight junctions. Calcium chelators are reversible tight junction modulators that have been shown to increase absorption across the intestinal epithelium. However, calcium chelators have not yet been shown to improve the extraction of biomarkers. Here we show that for glucose, a paracellularly transported biomarker, the flux into sweat can be increased by >10x using citrate, a calcium chelator, in combination with electroosmosis. Our results demonstrate a method of increasing glucose flux through the sweat gland epithelium, thereby increasing the concentration in sweat. Future work should examine if this method enhances flux for other paracellularly transported biomarkers to make it possible to detect more biomarkers with currently available biosensors.

AB Human activity and land-use change are dramatically altering the sizes, geographical distributions and functioning of biological populations worldwide, with tremendous consequences for human well-being. Yet our ability to measure, monitor and forecast biodiversity change - crucial to addressing it - remains limited. Biodiversity monitoring systems are being developed to improve this capacity by deriving metrics of change from an array of insitu data (e.g. field plots or species occurrence records) and Earth observations (EO; e.g. satellite or airborne imagery). However, there are few ecologically based frameworks for integrating these data into meaningful metrics of biodiversity change. Here, I describe how concepts of pattern and scale in ecology could be used to design such a framework. I review three core topics: the role of scale in measuring and modelling biodiversity patterns with EO, scale-dependent challenges linking insitu and EO data and opportunities to apply concepts of pattern and scale to EO to improve biodiversity mapping. From this analysis emerges an actionable approach for measuring, monitoring and forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting key opportunities to establish EO as the backbone of global-scale, science-driven conservation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

AB BACKGROUND: Poor-quality patient drug information has been identified as a major cause of preventable medication errors in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to require marketing authorization holders of medicinal products to implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. Aside from medication guides, no research has been conducted to assess the quality of patient-targeted REMS materials, including whether, and to what extent, patients find these materials understandable and actionable.; PURPOSE: To describe the readability, understandability, and actionability of patient educational materials in currently approved REMS programs, and to highlight opportunities for improving both the quality and effectiveness of these important drug safety tools.; METHODS: Seventy-seven REMS programs were identified from the FDA REMS database. We excluded medication guides (MGs) from our analysis because of the fact that there is a mandatory MG template. Based on this, we identified a total of 27 (non-MG) REMS patient materials on the FDA REMS website for analysis purposes. The materials were tested for readability using the Lexile Measure, the Gunning Fog Index, and Flesch Kincaid and then assessed using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for printable materials, for understandability and actionability.; RESULTS: Twenty-three of 77 (30%) REMS programs used educational materials to communicate serious risks to patients, yielding a total of 27 REMS patient materials for analysis. The median readability score for these materials was at a ninth-grade reading level or higher. While most (89%) of these patient education materials met established criteria for being understandable, less than half (49%) were deemed actionable.; DISCUSSION: Currently approved REMS patient materials fell short in terms of recommended reading level, and over half did not meet recommended standards for actionability. Developers of these materials should apply plain language principles when design these materials to improve their readability and to assess both understandability and actionability in order to increase the effectiveness when distributed to patients. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Understanding the many factors that influence implementation of new programs, in addition to their success or failure, is extraordinarily complex. This qualitative study examines the implementation and adaptation process of two linked clinical programs within Primary Care, diabetes shared medical appointments (SMAs) and a reciprocal Peer-to-Peer (P2P) support program for patients with poorly controlled diabetes, through the lens of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We illustrate the role and importance of pre-implementation interviews for guiding ongoing adaptations to improve implementation of a clinical program, achieve optimal change, and avoid type III errors.; METHODS: We conducted 28 semi-structured phone interviews between September of 2013 and May of 2016, four to seven interviewees at each site. The interviewees were physician champions, chiefs of primary care, pharmacists, dieticians, nurses, health psychologists, peer facilitators, and research coordinators. Modifiable barriers and facilitators to implementation were identified and adaptations documented. Data analysis started with immersion in the data to obtain a sense of the whole and then by cataloging principal themes per CFIR constructs. An iterative consensus-building process was used to code. CFIR constructs were then ranked and compared by the researchers.; RESULTS: We identified a subset of CFIR constructs that are most likely to play a role in the effectiveness of the diabetes SMAs and P2P program based on our work with the participating sites to date. Through the identification of barriers and facilitators, a subset of CFIR constructs arose, including evidence strength and quality, relative advantage, adaptability, complexity, patient needs and resources, compatibility, leadership engagement, available resources, knowledge and beliefs, and champions.; CONCLUSIONS: We described our method for identification of contextual factors that influenced implementation of complex diabetes clinical programs - SMAs and P2P. The qualitative phone interviews aided implementation through the identification of modifiable barriers or conversely, actionable findings. Implementation projects, and certainly clinical programs, do not have unlimited resources and these interviews allowed us to determine which facets to target and act on for each site. As the study progresses, these findings will be compared and correlated to outcome measures. This comprehensive adaptation data collection will also facilitate and enhance understanding of the future success or lack of success of implementation and inform potential for translation and public health impact. The approach of using the CFIR to guide us to actionable findings and help us better understand barriers and facilitators has broad applicability and can be used by other projects to guide, adapt, and improve implementation of research into practice.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02132676 .

AB BACKGROUND: The greatest opportunity for lifelong impact of genomic sequencing is during the newborn period. The "BabySeq Project" is a randomized trial that explores the medical, behavioral, and economic impacts of integrating genomic sequencing into the care of healthy and sick newborns.; METHODS: Families of newborns are enrolled from Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital nurseries, and half are randomized to receive genomic sequencing and a report that includes monogenic disease variants, recessive carrier variants for childhood onset or actionable disorders, and pharmacogenomic variants. All families participate in a disclosure session, which includes the return of results for those in the sequencing arm. Outcomes are collected through review of medical records and surveys of parents and health care providers and include the rationale for choice of genes and variants to report; what genomic data adds to the medical management of sick and healthy babies; and the medical, behavioral, and economic impacts of integrating genomic sequencing into the care of healthy and sick newborns.; DISCUSSION: The BabySeq Project will provide empirical data about the risks, benefits and costs of newborn genomic sequencing and will inform policy decisions related to universal genomic screening of newborns.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02422511 .

AB OBJECTIVES: We aimed to implement participatory research to answer a question posed by four Kichwa indigenous communities in Andean Ecuador about what actionable factors are associated with childhood stunting, overweight and food insecurity among their people.; DESIGN: We used mixed methods including household questionnaires, discussion groups with respondents of the questionnaires and anthropometric measurement of children (6 months to 12 years) from surveyed households.; SETTING: The study involved four Andean indigenous communities transitioning from traditional to Western lifestyles. They subsist mainly on small-scale agriculture and have a rich cultural heritage including their traditional language.; PARTICIPANTS: Anthropometric data were collected from 298 children from 139 households in four communities; all households completed the questionnaire. We held five discussion groups (6-10 participants each): three composed of mothers and two of farmers.; PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were stunting, overweight, food insecurity and their relationship with demographics, dietary habits and agricultural habits.; RESULTS: Of 298 children, 48.6% were stunted and 43.3% overweight for age. Stunted children were more likely to live in households that sold livestock (ORa 1.77, 95% CIa 1.06 to 2.95) and with illiterate primary caretakers (ORa 1.81, 95% CIa 1.07 to 3.06), but were less likely to live in households with irrigation (ORa 0.47, 95% CIa 0.27 to 0.81). Overweight children were more likely to be male (ORa 1.87, 95% CIa 1.02 to 3.43) and live in a household that sold livestock (ORa 2.14, 95% CIa 1.14 to 4.02). Some 67.8% of children lived in a household with food insecurity, more frequently in those earning below minimum wage (ORa 2.90, 95% CIa 1.56 to 5.41) and less frequently in those that ate quinoa in the past 24hours (ORa 0.17, 95% CIa 0.06 to 0.48). Discussion groups identified irrigation and loss of agricultural and dietary traditions as important causes of poor childhood nutrition.; CONCLUSION: Many indigenous communities face tumultuous cultural, nutritional and epidemiological transitions. Community-based interventions on factors identified here could mitigate negative health outcomes. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB The oncogenesis-promoting role of chromosomal rearrangements for several hematologic and solid malignancies is well recognized. However, identifying targetable, actionable, and druggable chromosomal rearrangements remains a challenge. Targeting gene fusions and chromosomal rearrangements is an effective strategy in treating gene rearrangement-driven tumors. The NTRK (Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase) gene family encodes three tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) receptors that preserve central and peripheral nervous system development and function. NTRK genes, similar to other genes, are subject to alterations, including fusions. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that TRK fusion proteins promote oncogenesis by mediating constitutive cell proliferation and survival. Several clinical trials have estimated the safety and efficacy of TRK fusion kinase receptor inhibitors and have demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in patients with NTRK-rearranged malignancies. Specifically, larotrectinib and entrectinib have emerged as potent, safe, and promising TRK inhibitors. Herein, we discuss the potential oncogenic characteristics of TRK fusion proteins in various malignancies and highlight ongoing clinical trials of kinase inhibitors targeting them. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Genomic sequencing of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) uncovers a paucity of actionable mutations, underscoring the necessity to exploit epigenetic vulnerabilities for therapeutics. In HCC, EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 represents a major oncogenic chromatin modification, but how it modulates the therapeutic vulnerability of signaling pathways remains unknown. Here, we show EZH2 acts antagonistically to AKT signaling in maintaining H3K27 methylome through epigenetic silencing of IGFBP4. ChIP-seq revealed enrichment of Ezh2/H3K27me3 at silenced loci in HBx-transgenic mouse-derived HCCs, including Igfbp4 whose down-regulation significantly correlated with EZH2 overexpression and poor survivals of HCC patients. Functional characterizations demonstrated potent growth- and invasion-suppressive functions of IGFBP4, which was associated with transcriptomic alterations leading to deregulation of multiple signaling pathways. Mechanistically, IGFBP4 stimulated AKT/EZH2 phosphorylation to abrogate H3K27me3-mediated silencing, forming a reciprocal feedback loop that suppressed core transcription factor networks (FOXA1/HNF1A/HNF4A/KLF9/NR1H4) for normal liver homeostasis. Consequently, the in vivo tumorigenicity of IGFBP4-silenced HCC cells was vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of EZH2, but not AKT. Our study unveils chromatin regulation of a novel liver tumor suppressor IGFBP4, which constitutes an AKT-EZH2 reciprocal loop in driving H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic reprogramming. Defining the aberrant chromatin landscape of HCC sheds light into the mechanistic basis of effective EZH2-targeted inhibition.

AB Yu, Downes, Carter, and O'Boyle (2016) introduce a new technique to incorporate effect size heterogeneity into meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) labeled full information meta-analytical structural equation modeling (FIMASEM). Cheung's (2018) commentary raises concerns about the viability of FIMASEM and provides its initial validation. In this reply, we briefly respond to those concerns noting how they relate to Yu et al.'s original conclusions, general MASEM practices, and operational decisions within the FIMASEM procedure. We synthesize Cheung's criticisms and build on his findings to lay out a research agenda for the future of MASEM and the role that our technique might play in it. In doing so, we clarify the conceptual nature of FIMASEM, identity inferential mistakes that current MASEM studies are likely to make, and offer specific and actionable recommendations in terms of the types of research questions FIMASEM is best suited to address and how FIMASEM results can best be interpreted and reported.

AB We have shown that antagomiR inhibition of miRNA miR-21 and miR-196b activity is sufficient to ablate MLL-AF9 leukemia stem cells (LSC) in vivo. Here, we used an shRNA screening approach to mimic miRNA activity on experimentally verified miR-196b targets to identify functionally important and therapeutically relevant pathways downstream of oncogenic miRNA in MLL-r AML. We found Cdkn1b (p27Kip1) is a direct miR-196b target whose repression enhanced an embryonic stem cell-like signature associated with decreased leukemia latency and increased numbers of leukemia stem cells in vivo. Conversely, elevation of p27Kip1 significantly reduced MLL-r leukemia self-renewal, promoted monocytic differentiation of leukemic blasts, and induced cell death. Antagonism of miR-196b activity or pharmacologic inhibition of the Cks1-Skp2-containing SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase complex increased p27Kip1 and inhibited human AML growth. This work illustrates that understanding oncogenic miRNA target pathways can identify actionable targets in leukemia. © 2018 Crown copyright.

AB Background: Evidence-based guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD) health maintenance and management have been developed for primary health care providers, but not for individuals with SCD. To improve the quality of care delivered to individuals with SCD and their caregivers, the main purposes of this study were to: (1) understand the desire for patient-centered guidelines among the SCD community; and (2) adapt guideline material to be patient-centered using community-engagement strategies involving health care providers, community -based organizations, and individuals with the disease.; Methods: From May-December 2016, a volunteer sample of 107 individuals with SCD and their caregivers gave feedback at community forums (n=64) and community listening sessions (n=43) about technology use for health information and desire for SCD-related guidelines. A team of community research partners consisting of community stakeholders, individuals living with SCD, and providers and researchers (experts) in SCD at nine institutions adapted guidelines to be patient-centered based on the following criteria: (1) understandable, (2) actionable, and (3) useful.; Results: In community forums (n=64), almost all participants (91%) wanted direct access to the content of the guidelines. Participants wanted guidelines in more than one format including paper (73%) and mobile devices (79%). Guidelines were adapted to be patient-centered. After multiple iterations of feedback, 100% of participants said the guidelines were understandable, most (88%) said they were actionable, and everyone (100%) would use these adapted guidelines to discuss their medical care with their health care providers.; Conclusions: Individuals with SCD and their caregivers want access to guidelines through multiple channels, including technology. Guidelines written for health care providers can be adapted to be patient-centered using Community-engaged research involving providers and patients. These patient-centered guidelines provide a framework for patients to discuss their medical care with their health care providers.

AB Incidental or secondary findings (ISFs) in wholeexome or wholegenome sequencing have been widely debated in recent literature. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics' recommendations on diagnostic ISFs have strongly catalyzed the discussion, resulting in worldwide reactions and a variety of international guidelines. This article will outline how propositions on levels of terminology, policy, and underlying values are still internationally criticized and adjusted. Unsolved questions regarding ISFs include a suitable terminology, adequate counseling or informed consent procedures, opt-out possibilities, reporting ISFs to (parents of) minors and values regarding professional duty, patient autonomy, and actionability. These questions will be characterized as intrinsically related and reciprocally maintained and hence, symptomatic, single-level reflections will be marked as ineffective. Instead, a level-integrative approach of the debate that explicitly acknowledges this interaction and considers a balance between internationally significant and case-specific solutions, will be advocated. Second, the inclusion of a patient perspective will be strongly encouraged to complement the professional preponderance in the current debate. The examination of lived patient experiences, a qualitative focus on the subjective meaning of ISFs, and a contextualization of meaning processes will be suggested as specific concretizations. This integrative and inclusive approach aims for a more comprehensive understanding of ISFs, a consideration of all relevant stakeholders' perspective and, ultimately, an effective health-care policy.

AB The human microbiome is the collective of microbes living in symbiosis on and within humans. Modulating its composition and function has become an attractive means for the prevention and treatment of a variety of diseases including cancer. Since the initiation of the human microbiome project in 2007, the number of academic publications and active patent families around the microbiome has grown exponentially. Screening patent databases can be useful for the early detection and the tracking of new technology trends. However, it is not sufficient to assess portfolio sizes because emerging players with small but high-quality patent portfolios will be missed within the noise of large but low-quality portfolio owners. Here we used the consolidated database and software tool PatentSight to benchmark patent portfolios, and to analyze key patent owners and innovators in the microbiome space. Our study shows how in-depth patent analyses combining qualitative and quantitative parameters can identify actionable early indicators of technology and investment trends from large patent datasets.

AB BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is a metastatic epithelial malignancy in the absence of an identifiable primary tumour. Prognosis for patients with CUP is poor because treatment options are generally limited to broad spectrum chemotherapy. A shift towards personalised cancer management based on mutation profiling offers the possibility of new treatment paradigms. This study has explored whether actionable, oncogenic driver mutations are present in CUP that have potential to better inform treatment decisions.; METHODS: Carcinoma of unknown primary cases (n=21) were selected and DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections prior to amplification and sequencing. Two distinct yet complementary targeted gene panels were used to assess variants in up to 76 known cancer-related genes for the identification of biologically relevant and actionable mutations.; RESULTS: Variants were detected in 17/21 cases (81%) of which 11 (52%) were potentially actionable with drugs currently approved for use in known primary cancer types or undergoing clinical trials. The most common variants detected were in TP53 (47%), KRAS (12%), MET (12%) and MYC (12%). Differences at the molecular level were seen between common CUP histological subtypes. CUP adenocarcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas harboured the highest frequency of variants in genes involved in signal transduction pathways (e.g. MET, EGFR, HRAS, KRAS, and BRAF). In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma exhibited a higher frequency of variants in cell cycle control and DNA repair genes (e.g. TP53, CDKN2A and MLH1).; CONCLUSION: Taken together, mutations in biologically relevant genes were detected in the vast majority of CUP tumours, of which half provided a potentially novel treatment option not generally considered in CUP.

AB Traditional vaccine development to prevent some of the worst current pandemic diseases has been unsuccessful so far. Germline-targeting immunogens have potential to prime protective antibodies (Abs) via more targeted immune responses. Success of germline-targeting vaccines in humans will depend on the composition of the human naive B cell repertoire, including the frequencies and affinities of epitope-specific B cells. However, the human naive B cell repertoire remains largely undefined. Assessment of antigen-specific human naive B cells among hundreds of millions of B cells from multiple donors may be used as pre-phase 1 ex vivo human testing to potentially forecast B cell and Ab responses to new vaccine designs. VRC01 is an HIV broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) against the envelope CD4-binding site (CD4bs). We characterized naive human B cells recognizing eOD-GT8, a germline-targeting HIV-1 vaccine candidate immunogen designed to prime VRC01-class Abs. Several distinct subclasses of VRC01-class naive B cells were identified, sharing sequence characteristics with inferred precursors of known bnAbs VRC01, VRC23, PCIN63, and N6. Multiple naive B cell clones exactly matched mature VRC01-class bnAb L-CDR3 sequences. Non-VRC01-class B cells were also characterized, revealing recurrent public light chain sequences. Unexpectedly, we also identified naive B cells related to the IOMA-class CD4bs bnAb. These different subclasses within the human repertoire had strong initial affinities (KD) to the immunogen, up to 13 nM, and represent encouraging indications that multiple independent pathways may exist for vaccine-elicited VRC01-class bnAb development in most individuals. The frequencies of these distinct eOD-GT8 B cell specificities give insights into antigen-specific compositional features of the human naive B cell repertoire and provide actionable information for vaccine design and advancement.

AB Eosinophilic solid and cystic (ESC) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has recently been described as a potentially new subtype of RCC based upon morphologic and immunohistochemical features. These neoplasms typically demonstrate solid and cystic architecture, and the neoplastic cells contain voluminous eosinophilic cytoplasm with granular cytoplasmic stippling. There is frequently focal immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 20. Although the initial cases all occurred in adult females and had benign outcome, we recently expanded the proposed spectrum of this neoplasm to include pediatric cases, multifocal neoplasms, and a case with hematogenous metastasis. ESC has been postulated to be analogous to a subtype of RCC consistently identified in tuberous sclerosis complex patients, and while previous work has demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at the TSC1 locus and copy number gains at TSC2 in ESC RCC, these genes have not been sequenced in ESC RCC. Using capture-based and amplicon-based next-generation sequencing, we now demonstrate the consistent presence of either TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutations in pediatric ESC RCC (8/9 cases) and adult ESC RCC (6/6 cases). These included a metastatic ESC RCC which had a complete response to mTOR targeted therapy. We also found these mutations in some neoplasms with variant morphology and thus potentially expand the spectrum of ESC RCC. These include one of our adult cases which demonstrated dominant "type 2" papillary RCC morphology and 2 of 3 previously unclassified pediatric RCC with features of ESC RCC minus granular cytoplasmic stippling. We also demonstrate TSC mutations in a case of so-called "oncocytoid RCC after neuroblastoma" with identical morphology and immunoprofile, providing a molecular link between the latter and ESC RCC. In summary, ESC RCC consistently harbors actionable TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, which are infrequently seen in established subtypes of RCC. These findings support TSC1/2 mutation as a molecular marker of ESC RCC, and suggest expansion of the clinicopathologic spectrum to include neoplasms with papillary architecture, occasional cases lacking well-developed granular cytoplasmic stippling, and a subset of RCC with oncocytic features in patients who have survived neuroblastoma.

AB Thymic carcinoma represents a rare and poorly understood type of thymic epithelial neoplasm that has been the subject of much controversy. Poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, also known as lymphoepithelioma-like thymic carcinoma, is a rare variant of thymic carcinoma that has not been adequately characterized in the literature. The clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular features of 25 cases are reported. The patients were 19 men and 6 women, ranging in age from 20 to 85 years (mean: 60y). The tumors presented clinically as anterior mediastinal masses with chest pain and shortness of breath or were found incidentally on imaging studies. Tumor size ranged from 2.0 to 13.5cm in greatest diameter. Most of the tumors were small, well-circumscribed and confined to the mediastinum. Five cases presented with large, bulky, and infiltrative masses. Histologically, the hallmark of these tumors was a neoplastic proliferation of large, round to oval cells with vesicular nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. Two histologic growth patterns were identified: tumors with a heavy lymphoplasmacytic stroma (lymphoepithelioma-like pattern), and tumors showing abundant desmoplastic stroma (desmoplastic pattern). Immunohistochemical stains showed strong positivity of the tumor cells for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK5/6, CK18, MOC31, p16, p40, and p63. MIB-1 showed on average 35% nuclear positivity. CD117 was positive in 21/25 cases and CD5 in 20/25 cases. Epstein-Barr encoded RNA in situ hybridization was positive in only 1 case. Electron microscopy in 4 cases showed primitive round to oval cells with prominent nucleoli, scant cytoplasm and immature cell junctions. Molecular features were studied by next-generation sequencing using high quality sequence data obtained from 18 patients. Variants with allele frequency between 5% and 45% and quality scores >50 were classified as somatic. A total of 16/18 cases had one or more somatic variants of unknown significance. One case showed an IDH1 p. R132C mutation, also of unknown significance. No "actionable" genes amenable to currently available targeted therapies were identified in this cohort. Clinical follow-up was obtained in 20 patients; 14 patients were alive and well with no evidence of disease between 1.5 and 16 years after diagnosis (median survival: 4y; mean: 5.5y). Most survivors had relatively small tumors (<5cm. diameter), were in stage I and II at diagnosis and showed clear surgical margins. Five patients died of their tumors with metastases to bone, brain, chest wall, lungs and lymph nodes; all were in advanced stages and showed positive margins. Prognosis for these tumors appears to be correlated with the staging and status of the margins at the time of initial surgery.

AB Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics faculty are increasingly incorporating both formal and informal group work in their courses. Implementing group work can be improved by an understanding of the extensive body of educational research studies on this topic. This essay describes an online, evidence-based teaching guide published by CBE-Life Sciences Education (LSE). The guide provides a tour of research studies and resources related to group work (including many articles from LSE). Instructors who are new to group work, as well as instructors who have experienced difficulties in implementing group work, may value the condensed summaries of key research findings. These summaries are organized by teaching challenges, and actionable advice is provided in a checklist for instructors. Education researchers may value the inclusion of empirical studies, key reviews, and meta-analyses of group-work studies. In addition to describing key features of the guide, this essay also identifies areas in which further empirical studies are warranted. © 2018 K. J. Wilson et al.

AB Evidence-based teaching practices are being encouraged to increase student skills and understanding in the sciences. Finding, interpreting, and applying education literature to a specific context are barriers to adopting these evidence-based practices. Here, we introduce a new feature, Evidence-Based Teaching Guides This feature identifies literature associated with specific pedagogies, which we distill to practical recommendations for teaching. The goals of the feature are: to provide instructors with tools to make research-supported choices to implement the pedagogy in question, to articulate the reasons for their choices, and to develop increased awareness of biology education research. We think these guides may also be useful for biology education researchers in identifying critical components, adaptations, and contextual features that could be investigated for a given pedagogy. Each guide consists of a website with a visual map of instructional choices associated with the topic and linked pages that summarize findings from the literature and provide additional links to and summaries of key articles. Each guide will include an instructor checklist of recommendations consolidated from the entire guide in order to provide instructors with a snapshot of instructional choices and actionable advice. © 2018 K.

AB Sepsis, a life-threatening immune response to blood infections (bacteremia), has a 30% mortality rate and is the 10th leading cause of US hospital deaths. The typical bacterial loads in adult septic patients are ≤100 bacterial cells (colony forming units, CFU) per ml blood, while pediatric patients exhibit only 1000 CFU/ml. Due to the low numbers, bacteria must be propagated through 24-hours blood cultures to generate sufficient CFUs for diagnosis and further analyses. Herein, we demonstrate that, unlike other rapid post-blood culture antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs), our phenotypic approach can drastically accelerate ASTs for the most common sepsis-causing gram-negative pathogens by circumventing long blood culture-based amplification. For all blood isolates of multi-drug resistant pathogens investigated (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter nosocomialis), effective antibiotic(s) were readily identified within the equivalent of 8 hours from initial blood draw using <0.5 mL of adult blood per antibiotic. These methods should drastically improve patient outcomes by significantly reducing time to actionable treatment information and reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistance. © 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry. © 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

AB The abnormal expression of c-ros oncogene1 receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) has been identified as clinically actionable oncogenic driver in non-small-cell lung cancer. Since crizotinib was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of advanced ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, ROS1 kinase has become a promising therapeutic target. Under the guidance of some advanced computer-assisted technologies, such as structure-based drug design, homology modeling and lipophilic efficiency parameters, several potent and selective inhibitors against wild-type and mutant ROS1 were designed and synthesized. In this article, we will review a series of scaffolds targeting ROS1 kinase from the hit-to-drug evolution strategies of their representative compounds and it is hoped that these design strategies would facilitate medicinal chemists to optimize the process of drug design.

AB Good practice statements (GPSs) have been proposed by the GRADE working group as a way of avoiding the inappropriate characterization of evidence as low quality in support of strong recommendations justified by indirect evidence. This commentary examines how the GPS methodology was applied to the development of a recent guideline for pediatric deceased donation after circulatory determined death. This guideline was informed by a broad body of indirect literature and addressed a variety of social, legal, and ethical questions in addition to several implementation issues. While the resulting document contained a vast majority of GPS (63 as opposed to seven actionable GRADEd recommendations), we maintain that this application was appropriate to develop recommendations within the GRADE framework. This commentary explores how GPS may be applied in this context and explores whether a new classification of recommendations focused on these types of issues may be appropriate.

AB This qualitative study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30years ago and have lived with the implications of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.

AB Purpose: To broaden access to and implementation of precision medicine in the care of patients with pancreatic cancer, the Know Your Tumor (KYT) program was initiated using a turn-key precision medicine system. Patients undergo commercially available multiomic profiling to determine molecularly rationalized clinical trials and off-label therapies.Experimental Design: Tumor samples were obtained for 640 patients from 287 academic and community practices covering 44 states. College of American Pathologists/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-accredited laboratories were used for genomic, proteomic, and phosphoprotein-based molecular profiling.Results: Tumor samples were adequate for next-generation sequencing in 96% and IHC in 91% of patients. A tumor board reviewed the results for every patient and found actionable genomic alterations in 50% of patients (with 27% highly actionable) and actionable proteomic alterations (excluding chemopredictive markers) in 5%. Actionable alterations commonly found were in DNA repair genes (BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations, 8.4%) and cell-cycle genes (CCND1/2/3 or CDK4/6 alterations, 8.1%). A subset of samples was assessed for actionable phosphoprotein markers. Among patients with highly actionable biomarkers, those who received matched therapy (n = 17) had a significantly longer median progression-free survival (PFS) than those who received unmatched therapy [n = 18; PFS = 4.1 vs. 1.9 months; HR, 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.94; P adj = 0.03].Conclusions: A comprehensive precision medicine system can be implemented in community and academic settings, with highly actionable findings observed in over 25% of pancreatic cancers. Patients whose tumors have highly actionable alterations and receive matched therapy demonstrated significantly increased PFS. Our findings support further prospective evaluation of precision oncology in pancreatic cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 24(20); 5018-27. ©2018 AACR. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB The TransPORTEC consortium previouslclassified high-risk endometrial cancer including poor-risk histologies such as clear cells, into four molecular subtypes "POLE mutated," "microsatellite unstable," "TP53 mutated," and "no specific molecular profile." We evaluated whether DNA damage response biomarkers could further refine this high-risk tumors classification, in particular the heterogeneous "no specific molecular profile" and "TP53 mutated" subsets recently qualified as poor prognosis in high-risk endometrial cancer. DNA damage response biomarkers including proteins involved in DNA damage (delta-H2AX), homologous recombination (RAD51), regulators of error-prone Non Homologous End-Joining (DNA-pk, FANCD2), and PARP-1 were evaluated in 116 high-risk tumors by immunohistochemistry. CD8 and PD-1 expression by immunochemistry and mutation analyses were performed previously. Survival outcome were calculated using Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank test. None of the DNA damage response biomarkers alone were prognostic. However markers were informative within molecular subsets. Among the "no specific molecular profile" subset, delta-H2AX+ was significantly predictive of poor disease free survival (Hazard Ratio=2.56; p=0.026), and among "TP53 mutated," a DNA-pk+/FANCD2- profile (favouring error-prone Non Homologous End-Joining) predicted worst disease free survival (Hazard Ratio=4.95; p=0.009) resulting in five distinct prognostic subgroups from best to worst prognosis: group1 "POLE mutated/Microsatellite unstable">group2 "no specific molecular profile with no DNA damage">group3 "TP53 mutated/Non Homologous End-Joining negative">group4 "no specific molecular profile with high DNA damage">group5 "TP53 mutated/Non Homologous End-Joining positive"; p=0.0002). Actionable targets were also different among subsets. Group3 had significantly higher infiltration of PD-1+ immune cells (p=0.003), segregating with group1. Group2 had frequent PI3K pathway mutations and ER positivity. While group5, with the worst prognosis, had high DNA damage and PARP-1 expression providing a rationale for PARP inhibition. Our findings have refined the TransPORTEC prognostic classification of high-risk endometrial cancer into five distinct subgroups by integrating DNA damage response biomarkers and identified molecular subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.

AB While synthetic lethality (SL) holds promise in developing effective cancer therapies, SL candidates found via experimental screens often have limited translational value. Here we present a data-driven approach, ISLE (identification of clinically relevant synthetic lethality), that mines TCGA cohort to identify the most likely clinically relevant SL interactions (cSLi) from a given candidate set of lab-screened SLi. We first validate ISLE via a benchmark of large-scale drug response screens and by predicting drug efficacy in mouse xenograft models. We then experimentally test a select set of predicted cSLi via new screening experiments, validating their predicted context-specific sensitivity in hypoxic vs normoxic conditions and demonstrating cSLi's utility in predicting synergistic drug combinations. We show that cSLi can successfully predict patients' drug treatment response and provide patient stratification signatures. ISLE thus complements existing actionable mutation-based methods for precision cancer therapy, offering an opportunity to expand its scope to the whole genome.

AB Precision medicine aims to tailor cancer therapies to target specific tumor-promoting aberrations. For tumors that lack actionable drivers, which occurs frequently in the clinic, extensive molecular characterization and pre-clinical drug efficacy studies will be required. A cell line maintained at low passage and a patient- derived xenograft model (PDX) were generated using a fresh biopsy from a patient with a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary origin. Next-generation sequencing, high throughput signaling network analysis, and drug efficacy trials were then conducted to identify actionable targets for therapeutic intervention. No actionable mutations were identified after whole exome sequencing of the patient's DNA. However, whole genome sequencing revealed amplification of the 3q and 5p chromosomal arms, that include the PIK3CA and RICTOR genes, respectively. We then conducted pathway analysis, which revealed activation of the AKT pathway. Based on this analysis, efficacy of PIK3CA and AKT inhibitors were evaluated in the tumor biopsy-derived cell culture and PDX, and response to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 was observed both in vitro and in vivo indicating the patient would benefit from targeted therapies directed against the serine/threonine kinase AKT. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that high throughput signaling pathway analysis will significantly aid in identifying actionable alterations in rare tumors and guide patient stratification into early-phase clinical trials.

AB The Internet is an easily accessible source of information for women experiencing anxiety in pregnancy and/or postpartum to use when seeking health information. However, the Internet has several drawbacks, including inaccurate content that may be perceived as being accurate, non-biased, and evidence-based. Prior research indicates that anxiety and postpartum mental health websites have poor quality in terms of describing treatment options. There is a lack of research and knowledge in the area of perinatal anxiety, and an absence of research evaluating perinatal anxiety websites. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of information regarding perinatal anxiety available on the Internet. Websites concerning perinatal anxiety were selected using the Google search engine. Each website was evaluated based on quality of health information, website usability, and readability. The 20 websites included in this study had low to moderate quality scores based on the DISCERN tool. There were no associations found between website order and website quality, or between website readability and website quality. Many websites had high PEMAT scores for the understandability section, which included content, style, and layout of information; however, most did not use visual aids to enhance comprehension. Most websites had low actionability scores, suggesting that information may not be useful in describing what actions may be taken to manage perinatal anxiety. This study highlights the need for high-quality websites concerning perinatal anxiety that are easy to navigate and provide the public with evidence-based information.

AB BACKGROUND: Communicating results to participants is a fundamental component of community-based participatory research (CBPR). However, in environmental exposure studies this is not always practiced, partly due to ethical concerns of communicating results that haveunknown clinical significance.; METHODS: Growing Up Healthy was a community-based participatory research study that sought to understand the relationship between environmental exposures to phthalates and early puberty in young girls. After in-depth consultation with a Community Advisory Board, study investigators provided group summary results of phthalate exposures and related health information to the parents of study participants. Parents' comprehension and knowledge of the health information provided was then assessed through questionnaires.; RESULTS: After receiving the information from the research team, responders were able to correctly answer comprehension questions about phthalate exposures in their community, were able to identify ways to reduce exposure to phthalates, and indicated plans to do so. Questionnaires revealed that parents wanted more information on phthalates, and that children's environmental health was an important concern.; CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that effective communication of exposure results of unknown clinical significance to participants in environmental health studies can be achieved by providing group summary results and actionable health information. Results suggest thatthere was an improvement in knowledge of environmental health and in risk reduction behaviors in our study population.

AB The Accelerate Pheno system uses automated fluorescence in situ hybridization technology with morphokinetic cellular analysis to provide rapid species identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results for the most commonly identified organisms in bloodstream infections. The objective was to evaluate the accuracy and workflow of bacterial and yeast ID and bacterial AST using the Accelerate Pheno system in the clinical microbiology laboratory. The consecutive fresh blood cultures received in the laboratory were analyzed by the Accelerate Pheno system within 0 to 8 h of growth detection. ID/AST performance, the average times to results, and workflow were compared to those of the routine standard of care. Of the 232 blood cultures evaluated (223 monomicrobial and 9 polymicrobial) comprising 241 organisms, the overall sensitivity and specificity for the identification of organisms were 95.6% and 99.5%, respectively. For antimicrobial susceptibility, the overall essential agreement was 95.1% and categorical agreement was 95.5% compared to routine methods. There was one very major error and 3 major errors. The time to identification and the time to susceptibility using the Accelerate Pheno system were decreased by 23.47 and 41.86 h, respectively, compared to those for the standard of care. The reduction in hands on time was 25.5 min per culture. The Accelerate Pheno system provides rapid and accurate ID/AST results for most of the organisms found routinely in blood cultures. It is easy to use, reduces hands on time for ID/AST of common blood pathogens, and enables clinically actionable results to be released much earlier than with the current standard of care.

AB Prior to 2013, genetic testing for Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals primarily consisted of the three-site BRCA1/BRCA2 AJ panel, full sequencing of BRCA1/2, or the Lynch syndrome mismatch repair genes. Multigene panel testing became more widely available in 2013, but limited data are available regarding the impact of multigene panel testing for AJ individuals. Here, we report the frequency of cancer susceptibility gene mutations in a cohort of 427 AJ individuals seen in the Cancer Risk Clinic at The University of Chicago. We found that 29% of affected and 37% of unaffected individuals carried a pathogenic mutation (32% of overall cohort), primarily known familial mutations in BRCA1/2. A minority of mutations were identified in non-BRCA1/2 genes and consisted mainly of AJ founder mutations in CHEK2, APC, and the mismatch repair genes. A panel of AJ founder mutations would have identified the majority (94%) of mutations in clinically actionable genes in both affected and unaffected patients. Based on recent cost-effectiveness studies, offering all AJ individuals a founder mutation panel may be a cost-effective cancer prevention strategy.

AB OBJECTIVES: Health registries are commonly used in medicine to support public health activities and are increasingly used in quality improvement (QI) initiatives. Illustrations of dental registries and their QI applications are lacking. Within dentistry, caries risk assessment implementation and documentation are vital to optimal patient care. The purpose of this article is to describe the processes used to develop a caries risk assessment registry as a QI initiative to support clinical caries risk assessment, caries prevention, and disease management for children.; METHODS: Developmental steps reflected Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recommendations for planning QI registries and included engaging "champions," defining the project, identifying registry features, defining performance dashboard indicators, and pilot testing with participant feedback. We followed Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence guidelines.; RESULTS: Registry eligibility is patients aged 0-17 years. QI tools include prompts to register eligible patients; decision support tools grounded in evidence-based guidelines; and performance dashboard reports delivered at the provider and aggregated levels at regular intervals. The registry was successfully piloted in two practices with documented caries risk assessment increasing from 57 percent to 92 percent and positive feedback regarding the potential to improve dental practice patient centeredness, patient engagement and education, and quality of care.; CONCLUSIONS: The caries risk assessment registry demonstrates how dental registries may be used in QI efforts to promote joint patient and provider engagement, foster shared decision making, and systematically collect patient information to generate timely and actionable data to improve care quality and patient outcomes at the individual and population levels. © 2017 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.

AB Hepatic steatosis is a multifactorial condition that is often observed in obese patients and is a prelude to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we combine shotgun sequencing of fecal metagenomes with molecular phenomics (hepatic transcriptome and plasma and urine metabolomes) in two well-characterized cohorts of morbidly obese women recruited to the FLORINASH study. We reveal molecular networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplants and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under the curve=87%) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the steatosis phenome (>75% shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via microbiome-based therapies.

AB STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the causes, timing, and factors associated with unplanned 90-day readmissions following elective spine surgery.; SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Unplanned readmissions after spine surgery are costly and an important determinant of the value of care. Several studies using database information have reported on rates and causes of readmission. However, these often lack the clinical detail and actionable data necessary to guide early postdischarge interventions.; METHODS: Patients undergoing elective spine surgery for degenerative disease at a major medical center were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal registry. Patient and surgery-specific characteristics, baseline, and 3-month patient-reported outcomes were prospectively recorded. Readmissions were reviewed retrospectively to establish the reason and time to readmission. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was created to analyze the independent effects of several factors on readmission.; RESULTS: Of 2761 patients with complete 3-month follow-up, 156 had unplanned 90-day readmissions (5.6%). The most common reason was surgery-related (52%), followed by medical complications (38%) and pain (10%). Pain readmissions presented with a median time of 6 days. Medical readmissions presented at 12 days. Surgical complications presented at various times with wound complications at 6 days, cerebrospinal fluid leaks at 12 days, surgical site infections at 23 days, and surgical failure at 38 days. A history of myocardial infarction, osteoporosis, higher baseline leg and arm pain scores, longer operative duration, and lumbar surgery were associated with readmission.; CONCLUSION: Nearly half of all unplanned 90-day readmissions were because of pain and medical complications and occurred with a median time of 6 and 12 days, respectively. The remaining 52% of readmissions were directly related to surgery and occurred at various times depending on the specific reason. This timeline for pain and medical readmissions represents an opportunity for targeted postdischarge interventions to prevent unplanned readmissions following spine surgery.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB Background: Alterations involving the RET kinase are implicated in the pathogenesis of lung, thyroid and other cancers. However, the clinical activity of multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) with anti-RET activity in RET-altered patients appears limited, calling into question the therapeutic potential of targeting RET. LOXO-292 is a selective RET inhibitor designed to inhibit diverse RET fusions, activating mutations and acquired resistance mutations.; Patients and methods: Potent anti-RET activity, high selectivity, and central nervous system coverage were confirmed preclinically using a variety of in vitro and in vivo RET-dependent tumor models. Due to clinical urgency, two patients with RET-altered, MKI-resistant cancers were treated with LOXO-292, utilizing rapid dose-titration guided by real-time pharmacokinetic assessments to achieve meaningful clinical exposures safely and rapidly.; Results: LOXO-292 demonstrated potent and selective anti-RET activity preclinically against human cancer cell lines harboring endogenous RET gene alterations; cells engineered to express a KIF5B-RET fusion protein -/+ the RET V804M gatekeeper resistance mutation or the common RET activating mutation M918T; and RET-altered human cancer cell line and patient-derived xenografts, including a patient-derived RET fusion-positive xenograft injected orthotopically into the brain. A patient with RET M918T-mutant medullary thyroid cancer metastatic to the liver and an acquired RET V804M gatekeeper resistance mutation, previously treated with six MKI regimens, experienced rapid reductions in tumor calcitonin, CEA and cell-free DNA, resolution of painful hepatomegaly and tumor-related diarrhea and a confirmed tumor response. A second patient with KIF5B-RET fusion-positive lung cancer, acquired resistance to alectinib and symptomatic brain metastases experienced a dramatic response in the brain, and her symptoms resolved.; Conclusions: These results provide proof-of-concept of the clinical actionability of RET alterations, and identify selective RET inhibition by LOXO-292 as a promising treatment in heavily pretreated, multikinase inhibitor-experienced patients with diverse RET-altered tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Ensuring patients benefit from the latest medical and technical advances remains a major challenge, with rational-linear and reductionist approaches to translating evidence into practice proving inefficient and ineffective. Complexity thinking, which emphasises interconnectedness and unpredictability, offers insights to inform evidence translation theories and strategies. Drawing on detailed insights into complex micro-systems, this research aimed to advance empirical and theoretical understanding of the reality of making and sustaining improvements in complex healthcare systems.; METHODS: Using analytical auto-ethnography, including documentary analysis and literature review, we assimilated learning from 5years of observation of 22 evidence translation projects (UK). We used a grounded theory approach to develop substantive theory and a conceptual framework. Results were interpreted using complexity theory and 'simple rules' were identified reflecting the practical strategies that enhanced project progress.; RESULTS: The framework for Successful Healthcare Improvement From Translating Evidence in complex systems (SHIFT-Evidence) positions the challenge of evidence translation within the dynamic context of the health system. SHIFT-Evidence is summarised by three strategic principles, namely (1) 'act scientifically and pragmatically' - knowledge of existing evidence needs to be combined with knowledge of the unique initial conditions of a system, and interventions need to adapt as the complex system responds and learning emerges about unpredictable effects; (2) 'embrace complexity' -evidence-based interventions only work if related practices and processes of care within the complex system are functional, and evidence-translation efforts need to identify and address any problems with usual care, recognising that this typically includes a range of interdependent parts of the system; and (3) 'engage and empower' - evidence translation and system navigation requires commitment and insights from staff and patients with experience of the local system, and changes need to align with their motivations and concerns. Twelve associated 'simple rules' are presented to provide actionable guidance to support evidence translation and improvement in complex systems.; CONCLUSION: By recognising how agency, interconnectedness and unpredictability influences evidence translation in complex systems, SHIFT-Evidence provides a tool to guide practice and research. The 'simple rules' have potential to provide a common platform for academics, practitioners, patients and policymakers to collaborate when intervening to achieve improvements in healthcare.

AB BACKGROUND: Potentially lethal cardiac channelopathies/cardiomyopathies may underlie a substantial portion of sudden unexplained death in the young (SUDY). The whole-exome molecular autopsy represents the latest approach to postmortem genetic testing for SUDY. However, proper variant adjudication in the setting of SUDY can be challenging.; METHODS: From January 2012 through December 2013, 25 consecutive cases of SUDY from 1 to 40 years of age (average age at death 27±5.7 years; 13 white, 12 black) from Cook County, Illinois, were referred after a negative (n=16) or equivocal (n=9) conventional autopsy. A whole-exome molecular autopsy with analysis of 99 sudden death-susceptibility genes was performed. The predicted pathogenicity of ultrarare, nonsynonymous variants was determined using the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines.; RESULTS: Overall, 27 ultrarare nonsynonymous variants were seen in 16/25 (64%) victims of SUDY. Among black individuals, 9/12 (75%) had an ultrarare nonsynonymous variant compared with 7/13 (54%) white individuals. Of the 27 variants, 10 were considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic in 7/25 (28%) individuals in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in 5/16 (31%) of autopsy-negative cases and in 2/6 (33%) victims of SUDY with equivocal findings of cardiomyopathy. Overall, 6 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 4/25 (16%) cases were congruent with the phenotypic findings at autopsy and therefore considered clinically actionable.; CONCLUSIONS: Whole-exome molecular autopsy with gene-specific surveillance is an effective approach for the detection of potential pathogenic variants in SUDY cases. However, systematic variant adjudication is crucial to ensure accurate and proper care for surviving family members. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic metagenomics and its associated trail of publications are spreading across the world. Multiple clinical labs in the United States, Europe, and Asia have gone to considerable lengths to optimize and validate a range of protocols for agnostically detecting viral, bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic parasite nucleic acid across a range of patient specimens to aid in diagnosis for particularly recalcitrant cases. Others see a role for diagnostic metagenomics as a frontline diagnostic to replace other microbiological testing. Areas covered: There are considerable barriers to adoption for diagnostic metagenomics, including analytical sensitivity, interpretation, actionability, turnaround time, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical utility, laboratory workflow, trial comparators, cost, and reimbursement. Expert commentary: Metagenomics is unlikely to become 'one test to rule them all' any time soon, not least because it is not indicative of historical infection like some of the highest volume tests in the clinical virology lab, viral serologies. The high cost and low marginal utility compared to 'standard of care' diagnostics have forced metagenomics to be mostly used for last-ditch cases. However, waiting for such patients to declare themselves as being diagnostically challenging in turn likely lessens the diagnostic yield and actionability of the information. Significant reductions in the cost of metagenomic sequencing are required for it to move up in the diagnostic pipeline. This review covers these associated obstacles of metagenomics, arguing for a parsimonious role in last-ditch diagnostics and awaiting the answer of many outstanding questions regarding its adoption.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this document is to provide updated guidance for the genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy and for an approach to manage secondary findings from cardiomyopathy genes. The genetic bases of the primary cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and restrictive) have been established, and each is medically actionable; in most cases established treatments or interventions are available to improve survival, reduce morbidity, and enhance quality of life.; METHODS: A writing group of cardiologists and genetics professionals updated guidance, first published in 2009 for the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), in a collaboration with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Each recommendation was assigned to teams of individuals by expertise, literature was reviewed, and recommendations were decided by consensus of the writing group. Recommendations for family history, phenotype screening of at-risk family members, referral to expert centers as needed, genetic counseling, and cardiovascular therapies, informed in part by phenotype, are presented in the HFSA document.; RESULTS: A genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy is indicated with a cardiomyopathy diagnosis, which includes genetic testing. Guidance is also provided for clinical approaches to secondary findings from cardiomyopathy genes. This is relevant as cardiomyopathy is the phenotype associated with 27% of the genes on the ACMG list for return of secondary findings. Recommendations herein are considered expert opinion per current ACMG policy as no systematic approach to literature review was conducted.; CONCLUSION: Genetic testing is indicated for cardiomyopathy to assist in patient care and management of at-risk family members.

AB Problem analysis conducted by a university-based research partner can provide communities with data-driven options to address the local drivers of serious youth and gang violence. Situated in Worcester, Massachusetts, this article describes how subsequent to early childhood trauma being identified as a potential driver of adolescent and young adult violence; problem analysis using local data confirmed that being the victim or witness of a traumatic incident before the age of 12 years was significantly correlated with involvement in violence in adolescence or young adulthood. Although there is a robust literature on the relationship between early childhood trauma and later delinquency, local decision makers did not consider this knowledge actionable until the research partner used the city's own police records to demonstrate the extent of the problem in the city. Rigorous problem analysis, conducted collaboratively between practitioners and an academic research partner, helped to compel local change and ensured that strategies addressed the right risk factors and directed service to the appropriate target population.

AB Background: Direct observations with focused feedback are critical components for medical student education. Numerous challenges exist in providing useful comments to students during their clerkships. Students' evaluations of the clerkship indicated they were not receiving feedback from preceptors or house officers.; Objective: To encourage direct observation with feedback, Structured Patient Care Observation (SPCO) forms were used to evaluate third-year medical students during patient encounters.; Design: In 2014-2015, third-year medical students at a Midwestern medical school completing an 8-week pediatrics clerkship provided experiences on inpatient wards and in ambulatory clinics. Students were expected to solicit feedback using the SPCO form.; Results/Findings: A total of 121 third-year medical students completed the pediatrics clerkship. All of the students completed at least one SPCO form. Several students had more than one observation documented, resulting in 161 SPCOs submitted. Eight were excluded for missing data, leaving 153 observations for analysis. Encounter settings included hospital (70), well-child visits (34), sick visits (41), not identified (8). Observers included attending physicians (88) and residents (65). The SPCOs generated 769 points of feedback, comments coalesced into themes of patient interviews, physical examination, or communication with patients and family. Once themes were identified, comments within each theme were further categorized as either actionable or reinforcing feedback.; Discussion: SPCOs provided a structure to receive formative feedback from clinical supervisors. Within each theme, reinforcing feedback and actionable comments specific enough to be useful in shaping future encounters were identified.

AB Precision cancer medicine promises to tailor clinical decisions to patients using genomic information. Indeed, successes of drugs targeting genetic alterations in tumors, such as imatinib that targets BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia, have demonstrated the power of this approach. However, biological systems are complex, and patients may differ not only by the specific genetic alterations in their tumor, but also by more subtle interactions among such alterations. Systems biology and more specifically, network analysis, provides a framework for advancing precision medicine beyond clinical actionability of individual mutations. Here we discuss applications of network analysis to study tumor biology, early methods for N-of-1 tumor genome analysis, and the path for such tools to the clinic. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies are now set to transform translational cancer proteomics from an idea to a practice. Here, we present a robust proteomic workflow for the analysis of clinically relevant human cancer tissues that allows quantitation of thousands of tumor proteins in several hours of measuring time and a total turnaround of a few days. We applied it to a chemorefractory metastatic case of the extremely rare urachal carcinoma. Quantitative comparison of lung metastases and surrounding tissue revealed several significantly upregulated proteins, among them lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A). LSD1 is an epigenetic regulator and the target of active development efforts in oncology. Thus, clinical cancer proteomics can rapidly and efficiently identify actionable therapeutic options. While currently described for a single case study, we envision that it can be applied broadly to other patients in a similar condition. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Due to the high mutational somatic burden of Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma (CMM) a thorough profiling of the driver mutations and their interplay is necessary to explain the timing of tumorigenesis or for the identification of actionable genetic events. The aim of this study was to establish the mutation rate of some of the key drivers in melanoma tumorigenesis combining molecular analyses and/or immunohistochemistry in 93 primary CMMs from an Italian cohort also characterized for germline status, and to investigate an interplay between germline and somatic variants. BRAF mutations were present in 68% of cases, while CDKN2A germline mutations were found in 16 % and p16 loss in tissue was found in 63%. TERT promoter somatic mutations were detected in 38% of cases while the TERT -245T>C polymorphism was found in 51% of cases. NRAS mutations were found in 39% of BRAF negative or undetermined cases. NF1 was expressed in all cases analysed. MC1R variations were both considered as a dichotomous variable or scored. While a positive, although not significant association between CDKN2A germline mutations, but not MC1R variants, and BRAF somatic mutation was found, we did not observe other associations between germline and somatic events. A yet undescribed inverse correlation between TERT -245T>C polymorphism and the presence of BRAF mutation was found. It is possible to hypothesize that -245T>C polymorphism could be included in those genotypes which may influence the occurrence of BRAF mutations. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of -245T>C polymorphism as a germline predictor of BRAF somatic mutation status.

AB BACKGROUND: Nigeria reports high rates of mortality linked with recurring meningococcal meningitis outbreaks within the African meningitis belt. Few studies have thoroughly described the response to these outbreaks to provide strong and actionable public health messages. We describe how time delays affected the response to the 2016/2017 meningococcal meningitis outbreak in Nigeria.; METHODS: Using data from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organisation (WHO), and situation reports of rapid response teams, we calculated attack and death rates of reported suspected meningococcal meningitis cases per week in Zamfara, Sokoto and Yobe states respectively, between epidemiological week 49 in 2016 and epidemiological week 25 in 2017. We identified when alert and epidemic thresholds were crossed and determined when the outbreak was detected and notified in each state. We examined response activities to the outbreak.; RESULTS: There were 12,535 suspected meningococcal meningitis cases and 877 deaths (CFR: 7.0%) in the three states. It took an average time of three weeks before the outbreaks were detected and notified to NCDC. Four weeks after receiving notification, an integrated response coordinating centre was set up by NCDC and requests for vaccines were sent to International Coordinating Group (ICG) on vaccine provision. While it took ICG one week to approve the requests, it took an average of two weeks for approximately 41% of requested vaccines to arrive. On the average, it took nine weeks from the date the epidemic threshold was crossed to commencement of reactive vaccination in the three states.; CONCLUSION: There were delays in detection and notification of the outbreak, in coordinating response activities, in requesting for vaccines and their arrival from ICG, and in initiating reactive vaccination. Reducing these delays in future outbreaks could help decrease the morbidity and mortality linked with meningococcal meningitis outbreaks.

AB BACKGROUND: Routine laboratory studies are often obtained following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Moreover, laboratory studies are often continued daily until the patient is discharged regardless of medical management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of routine complete blood count (CBC) tests following THA. Secondarily, the purpose was to identify patient factors associated with abnormal postoperative lab values.; METHODS: This retrospective review identified 352 patients who underwent primary THA at a single institution from 2012 to 2014. Preoperative and postoperative CBC values were collected along with demographic data, use of tranexamic acid (TXA), and transfusion rates. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with an abnormal postoperative lab and risk of transfusion.; RESULTS: Of the 352 patients, 54 patients were transfused (15.3%). Patients who underwent transfusion had a significantly lower preoperative hemoglobin (Hb; 12.0 g/dL) compared to patients who did not undergo transfusion (13.5 g/dL; P < .001). Patients who did not receive TXA were 3.7 times more likely to receive a transfusion. No patients received medical intervention based on the outcome of postoperative platelet or white blood counts. A Hb value below 11.94 g/dL for patients who are anemic preoperative or did not receive TXA predicted transfusion after postoperative day1.; CONCLUSION: Under value-based care models, cost containment while maintaining high-quality patient care is critical. Routine postoperative CBC tests in patients with a normal preoperative Hb who receive TXA do not contribute to actionable information. Patients who are anemic before THA or do not receive TXA should at minimum obtain a CBC on postoperative day1. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On June 22, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration expanded indications for dabrafenib and trametinib to include treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring BRAF V600E mutations. Approval was based on results from an international, multicenter, multicohort, noncomparative, open-label trial, study BRF113928, which sequentially enrolled 93 patients who had received previous systemic treatment for advanced NSCLC (Cohort B, n=57) or were treatment-naive (Cohort C, n=36). All patients received dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily. In Cohort B, overall response rate (ORR) was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49%-76%) with response durations ≥6 months in 64% of responders. In Cohort C, ORR was 61% (95% CI 44%-77%) with response durations ≥6 months in 59% of responders. Results were evaluated in the context of the Intergroupe Francophone de Cancerologie Thoracique registry and a chart review of U.S. electronic health records at two academic sites, characterizing treatment outcomes data for patients with metastatic NSCLC with or without BRAF V600E mutations. The treatment effect of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily was evaluated in 78 patients with previously treated BRAF mutant NSCLC, yielding an ORR of 27% (95% CI 18%-38%), establishing that dabrafenib alone is active, but that the addition of trametinib is necessary to achieve an ORR of >40%. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, edema, rash, chills, hemorrhage, cough, and dyspnea.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The approvals of dabrafenib and trametinib, administered concurrently, provide a new regimen for the treatment of a rare subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and demonstrate how drugs active for treatment of BRAF-mutant tumors in one setting predict efficacy and can provide supportive evidence for approval in another setting. The FDA also approved the first next-generation sequencing oncology panel test for simultaneous assessment of multiple actionable mutations, which will facilitate selection of optimal, personalized therapy. The test was shown to accurately and reliably select patients with NSCLC with the BRAF V600E mutation for whom treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib is the optimal treatment. Published 2018.

AB Human fecal contamination of water is a public health risk. However, inadequate testing solutions frustrate timely, actionable monitoring. Bacterial culture-based methods are simple but typically cannot distinguish fecal host source. PCR assays can identify host sources but require expertise and infrastructure. To bridge this gap we have developed a field-ready nucleic acid diagnostic platform and rapid sample preparation methods that enable on-site identification of human fecal contamination within 80 min of sampling. Our platform relies on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of human-associated Bacteroides HF183 genetic markers from crude samples. Oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes reduce false positives by sequence specifically transducing LAMP amplicons into visible fluorescence that can be photographed by unmodified smartphones. Our assay can detect as few as 17 copies/ml of human-associated HF183 targets in sewage-contaminated water without cross-reaction with canine or feline feces. It performs robustly with a variety of environmental water sources and with raw sewage. We have also developed lyophilized assays and inexpensive 3D-printed devices to minimize cost and facilitate field application. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advances in our molecular understanding of cancer biology have paved the way to an expanding compendium of molecularly-targeted therapies, accompanied by the urgent need for biomarkers that enable the precise selection of the most appropriate therapies for individual cancer patients. Circulating biomarkers such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are poised to fill this need, since they are "liquid biopsies" that can be performed non-invasively and serially, and may capture the spectrum of spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity better than conventional tissue biopsies. Increasing evidence suggests that moving beyond the enumeration of CTCs towards more sophisticated molecular analyses can provide actionable data that may predict and potentially improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss the potential of molecular CTC analyses to serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers to guide cancer therapy and early cancer detection. As technologies to capture and analyze CTCs continue to increase in sophistication, we anticipate that the potential clinical applications of CTCs will grow exponentially in the coming years.

AB Advances in sequencing technologies permit the analysis of a larger selection of genes for preconception carrier screening. The study was designed as a sequential carrier screen using genome sequencing to analyze 728 gene-disorder pairs for carrier and medically actionable conditions in 131 women and their partners (n = 71) who were planning a pregnancy. We report here on the clinical laboratory results from this expanded carrier screening program. Variants were filtered and classified using the latest American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline; only pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were confirmed by orthologous methods before being reported. Novel missense variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance. We reported 304 variants in 202 participants. Twelve carrier couples (12/71 couples tested) were identified for common conditions; eight were carriers for hereditary hemochromatosis. Although both known and novel variants were reported, 48% of all reported variants were missense. For novel splice-site variants, RNA-splicing assays were performed to aid in classification. We reported ten copy-number variants and five variants in non-coding regions. One novel variant was reported in F8, associated with hemophilia A; prenatal testing showed that the male fetus harbored this variant and the neonate suffered a life-threatening hemorrhage which was anticipated and appropriately managed. Moreover, 3% of participants had variants that were medically actionable. Compared with targeted mutation screening, genome sequencing improves the sensitivity of detecting clinically significant variants. While certain novel variant interpretation remains challenging, the ACMG guidelines are useful to classify variants in a healthy population. Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.

AB Pathway-based analysis holds promise to be instrumental in precision and personalized medicine analytics. However, the majority of pathway-based analysis methods utilize "fixed" or "rigid" data sets that limit their ability to account for complex biological inter-dependencies. Here, we present REDESIGN: RDF-based Differential Signaling Pathway informatics framework. The distinctive feature of the REDESIGN is that it is designed to run on "flexible" ontology-enabled data sets of curated signal transduction pathway maps to uncover high explanatory differential pathway mechanisms on gene-to-gene level. The experiments on two morphoproteomic cases demonstrated REDESIGN's capability to generate actionable hypotheses in precision/personalized medicine analytics.

AB Because deterioration in overall metabolic health underlies multiple complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, a substantial overlap among risk factors for the complications exists, and this makes the outcomes difficult to distinguish. We hypothesized each risk factor had two roles: describing the extent of deteriorating overall metabolic health and signaling a particular complication the patient is progressing towards. We aimed to examine feasibility of our proposed methodology that separates these two roles, thereby, improving interpretation of predictions and helping prioritize which complication to target first. To separate these two roles, we built models for six complications utilizing Multi-Task Learning-a machine learning technique for modeling multiple related outcomes by exploiting their commonality-in 80% of EHR data (N=9,793) from a university hospital and validated them in remaining 20% of the data. Additionally, we externally validated the models in claims and EHR data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (N=72,720). Our methodology successfully separated the two roles, revealing distinguishing outcome-specific risk factors without compromising predictive performance. We believe that our methodology has a great potential to generate more understandable thus actionable clinical information to make a more accurate and timely prognosis for the patients.

AB Genetic variation in cis-regulatory elements related to splicing machinery and splicing regulatory elements (SREs) results in exon skipping and undesired protein products. We developed a splicing decision model to identify actionable loci among common SNPs for gene regulation. The splicing decision model identified SNPs affecting exon skipping by analyzing sequence-driven alternative splicing (AS) models and by scanning the genome for the regions with putative SRE motifs. We used non-Hispanic Caucasians with neuroimaging, and fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identified 17,088 common exonic SNPs affecting exon skipping. GWAS identified one SNP (rs1140317) in HLA-DQB1 as significantly associated with entorhinal cortical thickness, AD neuroimaging biomarker, after controlling for multiple testing. Further analysis revealed that rs1140317 was significantly associated with brain amyloid-f deposition (PET and CSF). HLA-DQB1 is an essential immune gene and may regulate AS, thereby contributing to AD pathology. SRE may hold potential as novel therapeutic targets for AD.

AB Medication regimen may be optimized based on individual drug efficacy identified by pharmacogenomic testing. However, majority of current pharmacogenomic decision support tools provide assessment only of single drug-gene interactions without taking into account complex drug-drug and drug-drug-gene interactions which are prevalent in people with polypharmacy and can result in adverse drug events or insufficient drug efficacy. The main objective of this project was to develop comprehensive pharmacogenomic decision support for medication risk assessment in people with polypharmacy that simultaneously accounts for multiple drug and gene effects. To achieve this goal, the project addressed two aims: (1) development of comprehensive knowledge repository of actionable pharmacogenes; (2) introduction of scoring approaches reflecting potential adverse effect risk levels of complex medication regimens accounting for pharmacogenomic polymorphisms and multiple drug metabolizing pathways. After pharmacogenomic knowledge repository was introduced, a scoring algorithm has been built and pilot-tested using a limited data set. The resulting total risk score for frequently hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy (72.04±17.84) was statistically significantly different (p<0.05) from the total risk score for older adults with polypharmacy with low hospitalization rate (8.98±2.37). An initial prototype assessment demonstrated feasibility of our approach and identified steps for improving risk scoring algorithms.

AB BACKGROUND: Point-of-care technology (POCT) provides actionable information at the site of care to allow rapid clinical decision-making. With healthcare emphasis shifting toward precision medicine, population health, and chronic disease management, the potential impact of POCT continues to grow, and several prominent POCT trends have emerged or strengthened in the last decade.; CONTENT: This review summarizes current and emerging trends in POCT, including technologies approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration or in development. Technologies included have either impacted existing clinical diagnostics applications (e.g., continuous monitoring and targeted nucleic acid testing) or are likely to impact diagnostics delivery in the near future. The focus is limited to in vitro diagnostics applications, although in some sections, technologies beyond in vitro diagnostics are also included given the commonalities (e.g., ultrasound plug-ins for smart phones). For technologies in development (e.g., wearables, noninvasive testing, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, paper-based diagnostics, nanopore-based devices, and digital microfluidics), we also discuss their potential clinical applications and provide perspectives on strategies beyond technological and analytical proof of concept, with the end goal of clinical implementation and impact.; SUMMARY: The field of POCT has witnessed strong growth over the past decade, as evidenced by new clinical or consumer products or research and development directions. Combined with the appropriate strategies for clinical needs assessment, validation, and implementation, these and future POCTs may significantly impact care delivery and associated outcomes and costs. © 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB Purpose of Review: An important number of newly identified molecular alterations in prostate cancer affect gene encoding master regulators of chromatin biology epigenetic regulation. This review will provide an updated view of the key epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression, therapy resistance, and potential actionable mechanisms and biomarkers.; Recent Findings: Key players in chromatin biology and epigenetic master regulators has been recently described to be crucially altered in metastatic CRPC and tumors that progress to AR independency. As such, epigenetic dysregulation represents a driving mechanism in the reprograming of prostate cancer cells as they lose AR-imposed identity.; Summary: Chromatin integrity and accessibility for transcriptional regulation are key features altered in cancer progression, and particularly relevant in nuclear hormone receptor-driven tumors like prostate cancer. Understanding how chromatin remodeling dictates prostate development and how its deregulation contributes to prostate cancer onset and progression may improve risk stratification and treatment selection for prostate cancer patients.

AB Research in psychology has shown that both motivation and wellbeing are contingent on the satisfaction of certain psychological needs. Yet, despite a long-standing pursuit in human-computer interaction (HCI) for design strategies that foster sustained engagement, behavior change and wellbeing, the basic psychological needs shown to mediate these outcomes are rarely taken into account. This is possibly due to the lack of a clear model to explain these needs in the context of HCI. Herein we introduce such a model: Motivation, Engagement and Thriving in User Experience (METUX). The model provides a framework grounded in psychological research that can allow HCI researchers and practitioners to form actionable insights with respect to how technology designs support or undermine basic psychological needs, thereby increasing motivation and engagement, and ultimately, improving user wellbeing. We propose that in order to address wellbeing, psychological needs must be considered within five different spheres of analysis including: at the point of technology adoption, during interaction with the interface, as a result of engagement with technology-specific tasks, as part of the technology-supported behavior, and as part of an individual's life overall. These five spheres of experience sit within a sixth, society, which encompasses both direct and collateral effects of technology use as well as non-user experiences. We build this model based on existing evidence for basic psychological need satisfaction, including evidence within the context of the workplace, computer games, and health. We extend and hone these ideas to provide practical advice for designers along with real world examples of how to apply the model to design practice.

AB The growing role of targeted medicine has led to an increased focus on the development of actionable biomarkers. Current penalized selection methods that are used to identify biomarker panels for classification in high-dimensional data, however, often result in highly complex panels that need careful pruning for practical use. In the framework of regularization methods, a penalty that is a weighted sum of the L1 and L0 norm has been proposed to account for the complexity of the resulting model. In practice, the limitation of this penalty is that the objective function is non-convex, non-smooth, the optimization is computationally intensive and the application to high-dimensional settings is challenging. In this paper, we propose a stepwise forward variable selection method which combines the L0 with L1 or L2 norms. The penalized likelihood criterion that is used in the stepwise selection procedure results in more parsimonious models, keeping only the most relevant features. Simulation results and a real application show that our approach exhibits a comparable performance with common selection methods with respect to the prediction performance while minimizing the number of variables in the selected model resulting in a more parsimonious model as desired.

AB PURPOSE: ASCO has worked to facilitate the improvement in quality oncology care via the development of the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI). The extent to which the ASCO QOPI identifies areas in which pharmacists may enhance care is not known. These findings are important, as pharmacists are an integral part of the care team, providing direct clinical care in addition to medication use guidelines and practice-based policies. In addition, high-performing practices may receive reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.; METHODS: Three pharmacists reviewed 200 QOPI measures for potential pharmacist involvement. We used the Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association Scope of Practice document and a validated summary of services provided by board-certified oncology pharmacists to identify which practice domains and pharmacy services would best fit the care provided by the selected QOPI measures.; RESULTS: A total of 177 QOPI measures were analyzed. Potential areas of pharmacist impact were identified in 67 (38%) of the included metrics. Measures largely related to optimizing drug therapy through the development and implementation of pharmacy guidelines. Patient counseling and symptom management are services that best described the majority of QOPI measures deemed actionable by a pharmacist. We also found that several QOPI measures pharmacists can intervene upon overlap with metrics currently assessed for reimbursement via the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Merit-Based Incentive Payment System.; CONCLUSION: Oncology pharmacists are uniquely positioned to improve the quality of care provided to patients with cancer within the team-based setting.

AB Metachronous neoplasms have rarely been reported in patients with neuroblastoma. This report presents the clinical case of a 23-month-old child who was diagnosed with an anaplastic medulloblastoma 5 months after completing treatment for stage IV neuroblastoma. The patient was treated with complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation followed by maintenance chemotherapy at an outside institution and came to our institution for further management. A pathologic diagnosis and review of both the suprarenal and posterior fossa masses were performed, as well as a genetic analysis of both cerebellar tumor tissue and blood using next-generation gene sequencing. At our institution, the patient was submitted to induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and remains free of disease 2 years after completion of treatment. Genetic analysis revealed multiple somatic copy number variations with most deleted genes located in 2q37, a region which harbors genes involved in epigenetic regulation and tumor suppression. A homozygous deletion was found in the TSC2 gene, which is a clinically actionable gene, and patients with activating deletions in TSC2 can potentially be eligible for basket clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors. Germline single nucleotide variants were also identified in multiple genes involved in cancer (ALK, FGFR3, FLT3/4, HNF1A, NCOR1, and NOTCH2/3), cancer predisposition (TP53, TSC1, and BRCA1/2), and genes involved in DNA repair (MSH6, PMS2, POLE, and ATM). Metachronous neoplasms are rare and challenging to treat, hence genetic analysis and referral are needed to exclude hereditary cause. DNA sequencing of the tumor and germline can help identify alterations that increase predisposition or can be used to guide treatment decisions on recurrence and when standard options fail.

AB INTRODUCTION: We analyzed a large set of EGFR-mutated (EGFR+) NSCLC to identify and characterize cases with co-occurring kinase fusions as potential resistance mechanisms to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).; METHODS: EGFR+ (del 19, L858R, G719X, S768I, L851Q) NSCLC clinical samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor and blood) were analyzed for the presence of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and BRAF fusions. Treatment history and response were obtained from provided pathology reports and treating clinicians.; RESULTS: Clinical samples from 3505 unique EGFR+ NSCLCs were identified from June 2012 to October 2017. A total of 31 EGFR+ cases had concurrent kinase fusions detected: 10 (32%) BRAF, 7 (23%) ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), 6 (19%) ret proto-oncogene (RET), 6 (19%) fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), 1 (3.2%) EGFR, and 1 (3.2%) neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), including two novel fusions (SALL2-BRAF and PLEKHA7-ALK). Twenty-seven of 31 patients had either a known history of EGFR+ NSCLC diagnosis or prior treatment with an EGFR TKI before the fusion+ sample was collected. Twelve of the 27 patients had paired pre-treatment samples where the fusion was not present before treatment with an EGFR TKI. Multiple patients treated with combination therapy targeting EGFR and the acquired fusion had clinical benefit, including one patient with osimertinib resistance due to an acquired PLEKHA7-ALK fusion achieving a durable partial response with combination of full-dose osimertinib and alectinib.; CONCLUSIONS: RTK and BRAF fusions are rare but potentially druggable resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs. Detection of RTK and BRAF fusions should be part of comprehensive profiling panels to determine resistance to EGFR TKIs and direct appropriate combination therapeutic strategies.

AB Although smart infusion pumps are intended to prevent medication errors by alerting users about doses that exceed set thresholds, a large number of clinically insignificant alarms and alerts create the potential for alert and alarm fatigue. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases for peer-reviewed literature (January 1, 2004-August 31, 2017) on managing smart pump alerts, alarms, and related fatigue. Twenty-nine articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed and organized into themes. Smart pumps give users two types of signals: alarms that indicate mechanical issues such as occlusion, air in the line, or low battery; and clinical alerts that indicate that a programmed dose exceeds a predefined safety limit. Mechanical alarms occur with greater frequency than clinical alerts, but alarms and alerts vary widely by pump model, patient population, time of day, month, and type of drug. Several causes of clinically insignificant alerts and alarms may be actionable, and strategies proposed in the literature include development of a multidisciplinary team to oversee the quality improvement effort with involvement of end users, standardization of medication administration practices, widening of drug limit library thresholds when clinically appropriate, maintaining up-to-date drug limit libraries, and interoperability. Whereas many strategies have been proposed, and case studies have been reported, none have been rigorously evaluated. In addition, more research is needed related to managing occlusion and air-in-line alarms, especially for complicated infusions. Future work should focus on the evaluation of specific and replicable alert and alarm reduction strategies with a greater emphasis on quantitative metrics. © 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: High-quality mental health services for infants, children, adolescents, and their families can improve outcomes for children exposed to early trauma. We sought to estimate the workforce needed to deliver tertiary-level community mental health care to all infants, children, adolescents, and their families in need using a generalisable model, applied to South Australia (SA).; METHODS: Workforce estimates were determined using a workforce planning model. Clinical need was established using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children and the Young Minds Matter survey. Care requirements were derived by workshopping clinical pathways with multiprofessional panels, testing derived estimates through an online survey of clinicians.; FINDINGS: Prevalence of tertiary-level need, defined by severity and exposure to childhood adversities, was estimated at 5-8% across infancy and childhood, and 16% in mid-adolescence. The derived care pathway entailed reception, triage, and follow-up (mean 3 h per patient), core clinical management (mean 27 h per patient per year), psychiatric oversight (mean 4 h per patient per year), specialised clinical role (mean 12 h per patient per year), and socioeconomic support (mean 12 h per patient per year). The modelled clinical full-time equivalent was 947 people and budget was AU$126 million, more than five times the current service level.; INTERPRETATION: Our novel needs-based workforce model produced actionable estimates of the community workforce needed to address tertiary-level mental health needs in infants, children, adolescents, and their families in SA. A considerable expansion in the skilled workforce is needed to support young people facing current distress and associated family-based adversities. Because mental illness is implicated in so many burgeoning social ills, addressing this shortfall could have wide-ranging benefits.; FUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), Department of Health SA.

AB INTRODUCTION: Despite a burgeoning knowledge of the intricacies and mechanisms responsible for human disease, technological advances in medicinal chemistry, and more efficient assays used for drug screening, it remains difficult to discover novel and effective pharmacologic therapies. Areas covered: By reference to the primary literature and concepts emerging from academic and industrial drug screening landscapes, the authors propose that this disconnect arises from the inability to scale and integrate responses from simpler model systems to outcomes from more complex and human-based biological systems. Expert opinion: Further collaborative efforts combining target-based and phenotypic-based screening along with systems-based pharmacology and informatics will be necessary to harness the technological breakthroughs of today to derive the novel drug candidates of tomorrow. New questions must be asked of enabling technologies-while recognizing inherent limitations-in a way that moves drug development forward. Attempts to integrate mechanistic and observational information acquired across multiple scales frequently expose the gap between our knowledge and our understanding as the level of complexity increases. We hope that the thoughts and actionable items highlighted will help to inform the directed evolution of the drug discovery process.

AB BACKGROUND: Large-sequencing cancer genome projects have shown that tumors have thousands of molecular alterations and their frequency is highly heterogeneous. In such scenarios, physicians and oncologists routinely face lists of cancer genomic alterations where only a minority of them are relevant biomarkers to drive clinical decision-making. For this reason, the medical community agrees on the urgent need of methodologies to establish the relevance of tumor alterations, assisting in genomic profile interpretation, and, more importantly, to prioritize those that could be clinically actionable for cancer therapy.; RESULTS: We present PanDrugs, a new computational methodology to guide the selection of personalized treatments in cancer patients using the variant lists provided by genome-wide sequencing analyses. PanDrugs offers the largest database of drug-target associations available from well-known targeted therapies to preclinical drugs. Scoring data-driven gene cancer relevance and drug feasibility PanDrugs interprets genomic alterations and provides a prioritized evidence-based list of anticancer therapies. Our tool represents the first drug prescription strategy applying a rational based on pathway context, multi-gene markers impact and information provided by functional experiments. Our approach has been systematically applied to TCGA patients and successfully validated in a cancer case study with a xenograft mouse model demonstrating its utility.; CONCLUSIONS: PanDrugs is a feasible method to identify potentially druggable molecular alterations and prioritize drugs to facilitate the interpretation of genomic landscape and clinical decision-making in cancer patients. Our approach expands the search of druggable genomic alterations from the concept of cancer driver genes to the druggable pathway context extending anticancer therapeutic options beyond already known cancer genes. The methodology is public and easily integratable with custom pipelines through its programmatic API or its docker image. The PanDrugs webtool is freely accessible at http://www.pandrugs.org .

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global public health problem. The implementation of public health interventions (PHI) to control HCV infection could effectively interrupt HCV transmission. PHI targeting high-risk populations, e.g., people who inject drugs (PWID), are most efficient but there is a lack of tools for prioritizing individuals within a high-risk community. Here, we present Intelligent Network DisRuption Analysis (INDRA), a targeted strategy for efficient interruption of hepatitis C transmissions.Using a large HCV transmission network among PWID in Indiana as an example, we compare effectiveness of random and targeted strategies in reducing the rate of HCV transmission in two settings: (1) long-established and (2) rapidly spreading infections (outbreak). Identification of high centrality for the network nodes co-infected with HIV or > 1 HCV subtype indicates that the network structure properly represents the underlying contacts among PWID relevant to the transmission of these infections. Changes in the network's global efficiency (GE) were used as a measure of the PHI effects. In setting 1, simulation experiments showed that a 50% GE reduction can be achieved by removing 11.2 times less nodes using targeted vs random strategies. A greater effect of targeted strategies on GE was consistently observed when networks were simulated: (1) with a varying degree of errors in node sampling and link assignment, and (2) at different levels of transmission reduction at affected nodes. In simulations considering a 10% removal of infected nodes, targeted strategies were ~2.8 times more effective than random in reducing incidence. Peer-education intervention (PEI) was modeled as a probabilistic distribution of actionable knowledge of safe injection practices from the affected node to adjacent nodes in the network. Addition of PEI to the models resulted in a 2-3 times greater reduction in incidence than from direct PHI alone. In setting 2, however, random direct PHI were ~3.2 times more effective in reducing incidence at the simulated conditions. Nevertheless, addition of PEI resulted in a ~1.7-fold greater efficiency of targeted PHI. In conclusion, targeted PHI facilitated by INDRA outperforms random strategies in decreasing circulation of long-established infections. Network-based PEI may amplify effects of PHI on incidence reduction in both settings. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB T-cell lymphoma (TCL) is an uncommon and aggressive form of human cancer. Lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic tumor in canines (companion animals), with TCL representing approximately 30% of diagnoses. Collectively, the canine is an appealing model for cancer research given the spontaneous occurrence of cancer, intact immune system, and phytogenetic proximity to humans. We sought to establish mutational congruence of the canine with known human TCL mutations in order to identify potential actionable oncogenic pathways. Following pathologic confirmation, DNA was sequenced in 16 canine TCL (cTCL) cases using a custom Human Cancer Hotspot Panel of 68 genes commonly mutated in human TCL. Sequencing identified 4,527,638 total reads with average length of 229 bases containing 346 unique variants and 1,474 total variants; each sample had an average of 92 variants. Among these, there were 258 germline and 32 somatic variants. Among the 32 somatic variants there were 8 missense variants, 1 splice junction variant and the remaining were intron or synonymous variants. A frequency of 4 somatic mutations per sample were noted with >7 mutations detected in MET, KDR, STK11 and BRAF. Expression of these associated proteins were also detected via Western blot analyses. In addition, Sanger sequencing confirmed three variants of high quality (MYC, MET, and TP53 missense mutation). Taken together, the mutational spectrum and protein analyses showed mutations in signaling pathways similar to human TCL and also identified novel mutations that may serve as drug targets as well as potential biomarkers.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common form of primary malignant brain cancer in adults, is a devastating disease for which effective treatment has remained elusive for over 75 years. One reason for the minimal progress during this time is the lack of accurate preclinical models to represent the patient's tumor's in vivo environment, causing a disconnect in drug therapy effectiveness between the laboratory and clinic. While patient-derived xenografts (PDX's or xenolines) are excellent human tumor representations, they are not amenable to high throughput testing. Therefore, we developed a miniaturized xenoline system (microtumors) for drug testing. Nineteen GBM xenolines were profiled for global kinase (kinomic) activity revealing actionable kinase targets associated with intracranial tumor growth rate. Kinase inhibitors for these targets (WP1066, selumetinib, crizotinib, and cediranib) were selected for single and combination therapy using a fully human-derived three-dimensional (3D) microtumor model of GBM xenoline cells embedded in HuBiogel for subsequent molecular and phenotype assays. GBM microtumors closely resembled orthotopically-implanted tumors based on immunohistochemical analysis and displayed kinomic and morphological diversity. Drug response testing could be reproducibly performed in a 96-well format identifying several synergistic combinations. Our findings indicate that 3D microtumors can provide a suitable high-throughput model for combination drug testing.

AB Delivering evidence-based, personalized care that engages patients requires profound changes in the structure, process, and organization of care, along with revised incentives to support such changes. Health care providers must absorb and apply a vast, usually overwhelming, amount of scientific information to provide high-quality patient care. Accordingly, care remains inconsistent, with unintentional adverse consequences. Decision support tools can provide patient-specific assessments that support clinical decisions, improve prescribing practices, reduce medication errors, improve the delivery of primary as well as secondary prevention, and improve adherence to standards of care. Decision support tools are created using an individual patient's genetic, sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics to improve the delivery of precise, personalized care. Implementation requires ease of use for busy clinicians; uptake improves with active education, and gradual adoption of a tool integrated into care processes without disrupting clinical work flow. As health care systems continue to evolve and computerized support increases, increased implementation of decision support tools that are provided automatically as part of usual work flow, with clinically actionable recommendations at the point ofcare, requiring accountability for deviations from recommended therapy, represent an important opportunity to enhance quality of care by tailoring treatment to risk, improving the consistency of health care delivery, increasing patient knowledge and engagement, and avoiding specific therapeutic interventions in patients who will receive no benefit. However, successful implementation also requires strategies to engage providers in accepting and using these tools to improve care. Copyright © 2018 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

AB INTRODUCTION: Routine laboratory studies are often obtained daily after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) regardless of medical management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of routine basic metabolic panel (BMP) tests after TJA. Furthermore, the goal was to identify factors that may predispose patients to abnormal laboratory values that require medical intervention.; METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 767 patients who underwent primary TJA at a single institution. Preoperative and postoperative potassium, sodium, creatinine, and glucose values were collected along with demographic data, comorbidities, and procedural characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine independent risk factors for abnormal postoperative laboratory values.; RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with abnormal glucose (odds ratio [OR] 23.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-51.0, P < .001), while chronic kidney disease was associated with abnormal creatinine (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.8, P < .001) and potassium (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8, P= .014) requiring medical intervention. An abnormal preoperative laboratory value was also associated with medical treatment for each of sodium, potassium, and creatinine (all P < .001). Average number of BMP tests collected for patients who did not receive medical intervention was 2.8. This equated to $472,372.56 in total hospital charges.; CONCLUSION: Cost containment while maintaining high-quality patient care is critical. Routine postoperative BMP tests in patients with normal preoperative values without major medical comorbidities do not contribute to actionable information. Patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or with abnormal preoperative values should obtain a BMP after TJA. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma by inducing DNA damage. We hypothesize that somatic alterations in DNA damage response and repair (DDR) genes are associated with improved sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with diagnosis of locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with platinum-based chemotherapy who had exon sequencing with the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay were identified. Patients were dichotomized based on the presence/absence of alterations in a panel of 34 DDR genes. DDR alteration status was correlated with clinical outcomes and disease features.; RESULTS: One hundred patients were identified, of which 47 harbored alterations in DDR genes. Patients with DDR alterations had improved progression-free survival (9.3 vs. 6.0 months, log-rank P = 0.007) and overall survival (23.7 vs. 13.0 months, log-rank P = 0.006). DDR alterations were also associated with higher number mutations and copy-number alterations. A trend toward positive correlation between DDR status and nodal metastases and inverse correlation with visceral metastases were observed. Different DDR pathways also suggested variable effect on clinical outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: Somatic DDR alteration is associated with improved clinical outcomes in platinum-treated patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. Once validated, it can improve patient selection for clinical practice and future study enrollment. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We used whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing to identify clinically actionable genomic alterations in young adults with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Molecular characterization of 17 patients with PDAC enrolled in a precision oncology program revealed gene fusions amenable to pharmacologic inhibition by small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in all patients with KRAS wild-type (KRASWT) tumors (4 of 17). These alterations included recurrent NRG1 rearrangements predicted to drive PDAC development through aberrant ERBB receptor-mediated signaling, and pharmacologic ERBB inhibition resulted in clinical improvement and remission of liver metastases in 2 patients with NRG1-rearranged tumors that had proved resistant to standard treatment. Our findings demonstrate that systematic screening of KRASWT tumors for oncogenic fusion genes will substantially improve the therapeutic prospects for a sizeable fraction of patients with PDAC.Significance: Advanced PDAC is a malignancy with few treatment options that lacks molecular mechanism-based therapies. Our study uncovers recurrent gene rearrangements such as NRG1 fusions as disease-driving events in KRASwt tumors, thereby providing novel insights into oncogenic signaling and new therapeutic options in this entity.

AB Despite success of ERBB2-targeted therapies such as lapatinib, resistance remains a major clinical concern. Multiple compensatory receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways are known to contribute to lapatinib resistance. The heterogeneity of these adaptive responses is a significant hurdle for finding most effective combinatorial treatments. The goal of this study was to identify a unifying molecular mechanism whose targeting could help prevent and/or overcome lapatinib resistance. Using the MMTV-ERBB2;mutant p53 (R175H) in vivo mouse model of ERBB2-positive breast cancer, together with mouse and human cell lines, we compared lapatinib-resistant vs. lapatinib-sensitive tumor cells biochemically and by kinome arrays and evaluated their viability in response to a variety of compounds affecting heat shock response. We found that multiple adaptive RTKs are activated in lapatinib-resistant cells in vivo, some of which have been previously described (Axl, MET) and some were novel (PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, VEGFR1, MUSK, NFGR). Strikingly, all lapatinib-resistant cells show chronically activated HSF1 and its transcriptional targets, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and, as a result, superior tolerance to proteotoxic stress. Importantly, lapatinib-resistant tumors and cells retained sensitivity to Hsp90 and HSF1 inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo, thus providing a unifying and actionable therapeutic node. Indeed, HSF1 inhibition simultaneously downregulated ERBB2, adaptive RTKs and mutant p53, and its combination with lapatinib prevented development of lapatinib resistance in vitro. Thus, the kinome adaptation in lapatinib-resistant ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells is governed, at least in part, by HSF1-mediated heat shock pathway, providing a novel potential intervention strategy to combat resistance.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most common cancers, is a major public health issue globally, especially in Westernized countries. Up to 35% of CRCs are thought to be due to heritable factors, but currently only 5% to 10% of CRCs are attributable to high-risk mutations in known CRC susceptibility genes, predominantly the mismatch repair genes (Lynch syndrome) and adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC; familial adenomatous polyposis). In this era of precision medicine, high-risk mutation carriers, when identified, can be offered various risk management options that prevent cancers and improve survival, including risk-reducing medication, screening for early detection, and surgery. The practice of clinical genetics is currently transitioning from phenotype-directed single gene testing to multigene panels, now offered by numerous providers. For CRC, the genes included across these panels vary, ranging from well established, clinically actionable susceptibility genes with quantified magnitude of risk, to genes that lack extensive validation or have less evidence of association with CRC and, therefore, have minimal clinical utility. The current lack of consensus regarding inclusion of genes in CRC panels presents challenges in patient counseling and management, particularly when a variant in a less validated gene is identified. Furthermore, there remain considerable challenges regarding variant interpretation even for the well established CRC susceptibility genes. Ironically though, only through more widespread testing and the accumulation of large international data sets will sufficient information be generated to (i) enable well powered studies to determine if a gene is associated with CRC susceptibility, (ii) to develop better models for variant interpretation and (iii) to facilitate clinical translation.

AB Complex socio-ecological issues, such as climate change have historically been addressed through technical problem solving methods. Yet today, climate science approaches are increasingly accounting for the roles of diverse social perceptions, experiences, cultural norms, and worldviews. In support of this shift, we developed a research program on Hawai'i Island that utilizes knowledge coproduction to integrate the diverse worldviews of natural and cultural resource managers, policy professionals, and researchers within actionable science products. Through their work, local field managers regularly experience discrete land and waterscapes. Additionally, in highly interconnected rural communities, such as Hawai'i Island, managers often participate in the social norms and values of communities that utilize these ecosystems. Such local manager networks offer powerful frameworks within which to co-develop and implement actionable science. We interviewed a diverse set of local managers with the aim of incorporating their perspectives into the development of a collaborative climate change research agenda that builds upon existing professional networks utilized by managers and scientists while developing new research products. We report our manager needs assessment, the development process of our climate change program, our interactive forums, and our ongoing research products. Our needs assessment showed that the managers' primary source of information were other professional colleagues, and our in-person forums informed us that local managers are very interested in interacting with a wider range of networks to build upon their management capacities. Our initial programmatic progress suggests that co-created research products and in-person forums strengthen the capacities of local managers to adapt to change.

AB OBJECTIVES: To promote establishment of effective ototoxicity monitoring programs (OMPs), this report reviews the U.S. national audiology guidelines in relation to "real world" OMP application. Background is provided on the mechanisms, risks and clinical presentation of hearing loss associated with major classes of ototoxic medications.; DESIGN: This is a non-systematic review using PubMed, national and international agency websites, personal communications between ototoxicity experts, and results of unpublished research. Examples are provided of OMPs in various healthcare settings within the U.S. civilian sector, Department of Defense (DoD), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).; STUDY SAMPLE: The five OMPs compared in this report represent a convenience sample of the programs with which the authors are affiliated. Their opinions were elicited via two semi-structured teleconferences on barriers and facilitators of OMP, followed by a self-administered questionnaire on OMP characteristics and practices, with responses synthesized herein. Preliminary results are provided from an ongoing VA clinical trial at one of these OMP sites. Participants were 40 VA patients who received cisplatin chemotherapy in 2014-2017. The study arms contrast access to care for OMP delivered on the treatment unit versus usual care as provided in the audiology clinic.; RESULTS: Protocols of the OMPs examined varied, reflecting their diverse settings. Service delivery concerns included baseline tests missed or completed after the initial treatment, and monitoring tests done infrequently or only after cessation of treatment. Perceived barriers involved logistics related to accessing and testing patients, such as a lack of processes to help patients enter programs, patients' time and scheduling constraints, and inconvenient audiology clinic locations. Use of abbreviated or screening methods facilitated monitoring.; CONCLUSIONS: The most effective OMPs integrated audiological management into care pathways of the clinical specialties that prescribe ototoxic medications. More OMP guidance is needed to inform evaluation schedules, outcome reporting, and determination of actionable ototoxic changes. Guidance is also lacking on the use of hearing conservation approaches suitable for the mass testing needed to support large-scale OMP efforts. Guideline adherence might improve with formal endorsement from organizations governing the medical specialty stakeholders in OMP such as oncologists, pulmonologists, infectious disease specialists, ototolaryngologists and pharmacists.

AB Opportunities to participate in genomic sequencing studies, as well as recommendations to screen for variants in 59 medically actionable genes anytime clinical genomic sequencing is performed, indicate adolescents will increasingly be involved in decisions about learning secondary findings from genome sequencing. However, how adolescents want to be involved in such decisions is unknown. We conducted five focus groups with adolescents (2) and parents (3) to learn their decisional preferences about return of genomic research results to adolescents. Discussions about decisional preferences centered around three themes: feelings about receiving genomic risk information, adolescent involvement and capacity to participate in decision-making, and recommendations for parental versus collaborative decision-making. We address the contested space between parental duties to act in their children's best interests when choosing which results to return and adolescents' desires to make autonomous decisions. A collaborative decision-making approach is recommended for obtaining consent from adolescents and their parents for genome sequencing research.

AB Management of newborn infants fell in-hospital is especially challenging given the limited signs and symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage in this age group. We present a case of a four day old well appearing newborn infant found to have a severe epidural hemorrhage requiring emergent surgical drainage. Development of imaging protocols for newborn infants suffering in-hospital falls need to consider the potential consequences of missing actionable intracranial hemorrhage when relying on clinical observation as a management strategy.

AB Background Hospitalizations and 30-day readmissions are common in the hemodialysis population. Actionable clinical markers for near-term hospital encounters are needed to identify individuals who require swift intervention to avoid hospitalization. Aspects of volume management, such as failed target weight (i.e, estimated dry weight) achievement, are plausible modifiable indicators of impending adverse events. The short-term consequences of failed target weight achievement are not well established.Methods Statistically deidentified data were taken from a cohort of Medicare-enrolled, prevalent hemodialysis patients treated at a large dialysis organization from 2010 to 2012. We used a retrospective cohort design with repeated intervals, each consisting of 180-day baseline, 30-day exposure assessment, and 30-day follow-up period, to estimate the associations between failed target weight achievement and the risk of 30-day emergency department visits and hospitalizations. We estimated adjusted risk differences using inverse probability of exposure weighted Kaplan-Meier methods.Results A total of 113,561 patients on hemodialysis contributed 788,722 study intervals to analyses. Patients who had a postdialysis weight >1.0 kg above the prescribed target weight in ≥30% (versus <30%) of exposure period treatments had a higher absolute risk (risk difference) of 30-day: emergency department visits (2.13%; 95% confidence interval, 2.00% to 2.32%); and all-cause (1.47%; 95% confidence interval, 1.34% to 1.62%), cardiovascular (0.31%; 95% confidence interval, 0.24% to 0.40%), and volume-related (0.15%; 95% confidence interval, 0.11% to 0.21%) hospitalizations.Conclusions In the absence of objective measures of volume status, recurrent failure to achieve target weight is an easily identifiable clinical risk marker for impending hospital encounters among patients on hemodialysis.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Few molecules are currently verified to be actionable drug targets in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) dysregulation is related to several malignancies. However, the role of PP5 in CCA is poorly defined.; METHODS: Colony and tumorsphere formation assays were conducted to establish the role of PP5 in CCA tumorigenesis. Cantharidin (CTD) and norcantharidin (NCTD), both potent PP5 inhibitors, were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments to validate the potential therapeutic role of PP5.; RESULTS: Increased cell growth, colony formation and tumorsphere formation were observed in PP5-overexpressing CCA cells, whereas PP5 knockdown by shRNA decreased cell growth and colony formation. Tumours from HuCCT1 xenograft-bearing mice treated with PP5-shRNA showed decreased growth and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, CTD treatment decreased cell viability, reduced PP5 activity and enhanced AMPK phosphorylation in CCA cell lines. Overexpressing PP5 or enhancing PP5 activity suppressed AMPK phosphorylation and decreased CTD-induced cell death. Suppressing p-AMPK with siRNA or inhibitors also decreased CTD-induced cell death, suggesting a pivotal role for PP5-AMPK cascades in CCA. Immunoprecipitation revealed that PP5 interacted with AMPK. Importantly, treatment of HuCCT1 xenograft-bearing mice with NCTD, a CTD analogue with a lower systemic toxicity in vivo, suppressed PP5 activity, increased p-AMPK and reduced tumour volume.; CONCLUSIONS: Protein phosphatase 5 negatively regulates AMPK phosphorylation and contributes to CCA aggressiveness; thus, PP5 may be a potential therapeutic target in CCA. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB Introduction An important yet understudied component of postpartum type 2 diabetes risk reduction among high risk women is experiences with the healthcare system. Our objective was to describe the healthcare experiences of a diverse, low-income sample of women with prior GDM, including their suggestions for improving care. Methods Focus groups were conducted among African American, Hispanic, and Appalachian women who were diagnosed with GDM within the past 10years. Participants were recruited from community and medical resources. Twelve focus groups were conducted, four within each race-ethnic group. Results Three broad themes were identified around barriers to GDM care, management, and follow-up: (1) communication issues; (2) personal and environmental barriers; and (3) type and quality of healthcare. Many women felt communication with their provider could be improved, including more education on the severity of GDM, streamlining information to be less overwhelming, and providing additional support through referrals to community resources. Although women expressed interest in receiving more actionable advice for managing GDM during pregnancy and for preventing type 2 diabetes postpartum, few women reported changing behaviors. Barriers to behavior change were related to cost, transportation, and competing demands. Several opportunities for improved care were elucidated. Discussion Our findings suggest that across all racial and ethnic representations in our sample, low-income women with GDM experience similar communication, personal, and environmental barriers related to the healthcare they receive for their GDM. Considering the increased exposure to the health care system during a GDM-affected pregnancy, there are opportunities to address barriers among women with GDM across different race-ethnic groups.

AB Cancer driver prioritization for functional analysis of potential actionable therapeutic targets is a significant challenge. Meta-analyses of mutated genes across different human cancer types for driver prioritization has reaffirmed the role of major players in cancer, including KRAS, TP53 and EGFR, but has had limited success in prioritizing genes with non-recurrent mutations in specific cancer types. Sleeping Beauty (SB) insertional mutagenesis is a powerful experimental gene discovery framework to define driver genes in mouse models of human cancers. Meta-analyses of SB datasets across multiple tumor types is a potentially informative approach to prioritize drivers, and complements efforts in human cancers. Here, we report the development of SB Driver Analysis, an in-silico method for defining cancer driver genes that positively contribute to tumor initiation and progression from population-level SB insertion data sets. We demonstrate that SB Driver Analysis computationally prioritizes drivers and defines distinct driver classes from end-stage tumors that predict their putative functions during tumorigenesis. SB Driver Analysis greatly enhances our ability to analyze, interpret and prioritize drivers from SB cancer datasets and will continue to substantially increase our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer.

AB AIM: To determine the projected impact of a multigene pharmacogenetic (PGx) test on medication prescribing.; MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted with 122 cardiac catheterization laboratory patients undergoing angiography for eligibility of potential PGx-guided interventions that could have occurred if multigene PGx information was pre-emptively available at the time of the procedure. Medication data and presence of actionable at-risk genotypes were used to determine eligibility of a PGx intervention.; RESULTS: 20% of the study population (n=24) would have qualified for at least one PGx-based medication intervention per US FDA or Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)guidelines within 6months of their cardiac catheterization procedure. Commonly encountered gene-drug pairs for these interventions included: CYP2C19 for clopidogrel and antidepressants, CYP2D6 for antidepressants and codeine, SLCO1B1 for simvastatin, and VKORC1/CYP2C9 for warfarin.; CONCLUSION: Pre-emptive use of a multigene PGx test in the cardiac catheterization laboratory offers potential to reduce adverse medication outcomes.

AB Two articles in this issue of the Hastings Center Report (May-June 2018) argue that having knowledge of genetic mutations can entail a moral responsibility to rescue others. In the lead article, Madison Kilbride, a philosopher at the Perelman School of Medicine, assigns to the patient, under certain conditions, a task physicians are prohibited from taking on without patient consent: to disclose a finding of a serious, clinically actionable genetic mutation to the patient's relatives who are likely to have the same mutation. Kilbride emphasizes that the responsibility to family members that comes with such a finding has nothing to do with special obligations, duties to people with whom one has special relationships, such as people one lives with, works with, or loves. Rather, Kilbride maintains, the patient's duty to warn is grounded, in the principle of rescue; "another person  who just happens to be the patient's relative  is at risk of suffering serious harm." In an article on disclosing incidental findings, Haley Sullivan and Benjamin Berkman, both at the National Institutes of Health, consider the ethical professional responsibility of those conducting genetic research on human subjects in low- and middle-income countries, where many people are made vulnerable by the scarcity and inferiority of medical and other resources. © 2018 The Hastings Center.

AB In "Genetic Privacy, Disease Prevention, and the Principle of Rescue," Madison Kilbride argues that patients have a duty to warn biological family members about clinically actionable adverse genetic findings. The duty does not stem from the special obligations that we may have to family members, she argues, but rather follows from the principle of rescue, which she understands as the idea that one ought to prevent, reduce, or mitigate the risk of harm to another person when the expected harm is serious and the cost or risk to oneself is sufficiently moderate. We doubt, however, whether the principle of rescue can ground a duty to warn in the cases Kilbride envisages, and we suggest that Kilbride may have underappreciated the role that special obligations could play in generating a duty to warn family members. © 2018 The Hastings Center.

AB Much new global genetic research employs whole genome sequencing, which provides researchers with large amounts of data. The quantity of data has led to the generation and discovery of more incidental or secondary findings and to vigorous theoretical discussions about the ethical obligations that follow from these incidental findings. After a decade of debate in the genetic research community, there is a growing consensus that researchers should, at the very least, offer to return incidental findings that provide high-impact, medically relevant information, when it is not unduly burdensome to the research enterprise to do so. Much as genetic research has been limited to U.S. and European settings, the incidental findings debate has primarily focused on research conducted in high-income countries. In a 2015 paper, Alberto Ortiz-Osorno, Linda Ehler, and Judith Brooks note salient differences between the circumstances of research participants in low- and high-resource settings that alter the analysis of when and why incidental findings should be offered to research participants. In this article, we expand on their analysis and present a framework for thinking about how investigators' obligations to return genomic data might change in low-resource settings, particularly in settings where participants do not have access to the medical care needed to treat, assess, or monitor incidental findings that are actionable in settings with plentiful resources. © 2018 The Hastings Center.

AB BACKGROUND: The shift toward value-based bundled payment models in total joint arthroplasty highlights the need for identification of modifiable risk factors for increased spending as well as opportunities to mitigate perioperative treatment of chronic disease. The purpose of this study was to identify preoperative comorbidities that result in an increased financial burden using institutional data at a single institution.; METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of total joint arthroplasty patients and collected payment data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for each patient up to 90 days after surgery in accordance with the regulations of the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement initiative. Statistical analysis and comparison of preoperative profile and Medicare payments as a surrogate for cost were completed.; RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-four patients were identified over a 4-year time period who underwent surgery before adoption of the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement but that met criteria for inclusion. The median total payment per patient episode of care was $20,048. Preoperative diagnosis of alcoholism, anemia, diabetes, and obesity was found to have a statistically significant effect on total payments. The model predicted a geometric mean increase from $1425 to $9308 for patients bearing these comorbidities.; CONCLUSION: With Medicare payments as a surrogate for cost, we demonstrate that specific patient comorbidities and a cumulative increase in comorbidities predict increased costs. This study was based on institutional data rather than administrative data to gain actionable information on an institutional level and highlight potential flaws in research based on administrative data.

AB The degree of agreement between four commercial pharmacogenetic-based decision support tools (DSTs) was examined in five outpatients with major depressive disorder and at least two previous antidepressant failures. Comparisons were made across seven pharmacokinetic (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and UGT2B15) and seven pharmacodynamic (BDNF, COMT, HLA-A, HTR2A, HTR2C, OPRM1, and SLC6A4) genes that were included on ≥2 of the four DST testing panels. Among these overlapping genes, genotype (33-100%) and predicted phenotype (20-100%) agreement varied substantially. Medication recommendation agreement was the greatest for mood stabilizers (84%), followed by antidepressants (56%), anxiolytics/hypnotics (56%), and antipsychotics (55%). Approximately one-quarter (26%) of all medication recommendations were jointly flagged by two or more DSTs as "actionable" but 19% of these recommendations provided conflicting advice (e.g., dosing) for the same medication.The level of disagreement in medication recommendations across the pharmacogenetic DSTs indicates that these tests cannot be assumed to be equivalent or interchangeable. Additional efforts to standardize genetic-based phenotyping and to develop medication guidelines are warranted.

AB Ensuring the conditions for all people to be healthy, though always the core mission of public health, has evolved in approaches in response to the changing epidemiology and challenges. In the Public Health 3.0 era, multisectorial efforts are essential in addressing not only infectious or noncommunicable diseases but also upstream social determinants of health. In this article, we argue that actionable, geographically granular, and timely intelligence is an essential infrastructure for the protection of our health today. Even though local and state efforts are key, there are substantial federal roles in accelerating data access, connecting existing data systems, providing guidance, incentivizing nonproprietary analytic tools, and coordinating measures that matter most.

AB BACKGROUND: Currently, many risk assessment tools are available for clinicians to assess a patient's periodontal disease risk. Numerous studies demonstrate the potential of these tools to promote preventive management and reduce morbidity due to periodontal disease. Despite these promising results, solo and small group dental practices, where most people receive care, have not adopted risk assessment tools widely, primarily due to lack of studies in these settings. The objective of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of dental providers in these settings toward risk-based care through focus groups.; METHODS: We conducted six focus group sessions with 52 dentists and dental hygienists practicing in solo and small group practices in Pittsburgh, PA and New York City (NYC), NY. An experienced moderator and a note-taker conducted the six sessions, each including 8-10 participants and lasting approximately 90min. All sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two researchers coded the focus group transcripts. Using a thematic analysis approach, they reviewed the coding results to identify important themes and selected representative excerpts that best described each theme.; RESULTS: Providers strongly believed identifying risk factors could predict periodontal disease and use this information to change their patients' behavior. A successful risk assessment tool could assist them in educating and changing their patient's behaviors to adopt a healthy lifestyle, thus enabling them to play a major role in their patients' overall health. However, to achieve this goal, it is essential to educate all dental providers and not just dentists on performing risk assessment and translating the results into actionable recommendations for patients. According to study participants, the research community has focused more on translating research findings into a risk assessment tool, and less on how clinicians would use these tools during patient encounters and if it affects a patients' risk or outcome.; CONCLUSIONS: Dental practitioners were open to performing risk assessment as routine care and playing a bigger role in their patients' overall health. Recommendations to overcome major barriers included educating dental providers at all levels, conducting more research about their adoption and use in real-world settings and developing appropriate reimbursement models.

AB Extensive spontaneous DNA damage from oncogene-induced replication stress is ubiquitous in precancerous lesions. While this damage induces differentiation, senescence, or apoptosis in normal cells, defects in DNA replication stress response (RSR) allow cells to continue proliferating, ultimately leading to early tumorigenesis. Using systems-level approaches, we developed a replication stress response defect gene signature that predicted riskof cancer development from hyperplastic lesions. Intriguingly, we found that replication stress response defects rewire non-malignant cells into a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like state, and analysis of CSCs indicated that they inherently harbor replication stress response defects. High-throughput drug screening to elucidate molecules required for survival of replication stress response defective cells identified a dependence on MEK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of this signaling cascade restored oncogene-induced senescence through a p53-independent MDM2/p21 axis. Moreover, MEK/ERK inhibition also depleted CSC populations. Together, these findings provide insights into the role of replication stress response defects in CSCs and an actionable pathway for therapeutic targeting. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

AB Purpose: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing provides a noninvasive method for obtaining actionable genomic information to guide personalized cancer treatment, but the presence of multiple alterations in circulation related to treatment and tumor heterogeneity complicate the interpretation of the observed variants.Experimental Design: We describe the somatic mutation landscape of 70 cancer genes from cfDNA deep-sequencing analysis of 21,807 patients with treated, late-stage cancers across >50 cancer types. To facilitate interpretation of the genomic complexity of circulating tumor DNA in advanced, treated cancer patients, we developed methods to identify cfDNA copy-number driver alterations and cfDNA clonality.Results: Patterns and prevalence of cfDNA alterations in major driver genes for non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancer largely recapitulated those from tumor tissue sequencing compendia (The Cancer Genome Atlas and COSMIC; r = 0.90-0.99), with the principal differences in alteration prevalence being due to patient treatment. This highly sensitive cfDNA sequencing assay revealed numerous subclonal tumor-derived alterations, expected as a result of clonal evolution, but leading to an apparent departure from mutual exclusivity in treatment-naive tumors. Upon applying novel cfDNA clonality and copy-number driver identification methods, robust mutual exclusivity was observed among predicted truncal driver cfDNA alterations (FDR = 5 * 10-7 for EGFR and ERBB2), in effect distinguishing tumor-initiating alterations from secondary alterations. Treatment-associated resistance, including both novel alterations and parallel evolution, was common in the cfDNA cohort and was enriched in patients with targetable driver alterations (>18.6% patients).Conclusions: Together, these retrospective analyses of a large cfDNA sequencing data set reveal subclonal structures and emerging resistance in advanced solid tumors.

AB Purpose: High-risk neuroblastoma is an aggressive disease. DNA sequencing studies have revealed a paucity of actionable genomic alterations and a low mutation burden, posing challenges to develop effective novel therapies. We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the biology of this disease, including a focus on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).Experimental Design: We performed deep RNA-seq on pretreatment diagnostic tumors from 129 high-risk and 21 low- or intermediate-risk patients with neuroblastomas. We used single-sample gene set enrichment analysis to detect gene expression signatures of TILs in tumors and examined their association with clinical and molecular parameters, including patient outcome. The expression profiles of 190 additional pretreatment diagnostic neuroblastomas, a neuroblastoma tissue microarray, and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were used to validate our findings.Results: We found that MYCN-not-amplified (MYCN-NA) tumors had significantly higher cytotoxic TIL signatures compared with MYCN-amplified (MYCN-A) tumors. A reported MYCN activation signature was significantly associated with poor outcome for high-risk patients with MYCN-NA tumors; however, a subgroup of these patients who had elevated activated natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and cytolytic signatures showed improved outcome and expansion of infiltrating TCR clones. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of immune exhaustion marker genes, indicating an immune-suppressive microenvironment in these neuroblastomas.Conclusions: This study provides evidence that RNA signatures of cytotoxic TIL are associated with the presence of activated NK/T cells and improved outcomes in high-risk neuroblastoma patients harboring MYCN-NA tumors. Our findings suggest that these high-risk patients with MYCN-NA neuroblastoma may benefit from additional immunotherapies incorporated into the current therapeutic strategies.

AB In recent decades, breast cancer has become largely manageable due to successes with hormone receptor targeting. Hormone receptor-positive tumors have favorable outcomes in comparison to estrogen receptor (ESR1, ER)/progesterone receptor-negative tumors given the targetable nature of these tumors, as well as their inherently less aggressive character. Nonetheless, treatment resistance is frequently encountered due to a variety of mechanisms, including ESR1 mutations and loss of ER expression. A new era of precision medicine utilizes a range of methodologies to allow real-time analysis of individual genomic signatures in metastases and liquid biopsies with the goal of finding clinically actionable targets. Preliminary studies have shown improved progression-free survival and overall survival with implementation of this information for clinical decision making. In this review, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges in integrating precision medicine through next-generation genomic sequencing into the management of breast cancer.

AB PURPOSE: Clinically relevant secondary variants were identified in parents enrolled with a child with developmental delay and intellectual disability.; METHODS: Exome/genome sequencing and analysis of 789 "unaffected" parents was performed.; RESULTS: Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in 21 genes within 25 individuals (3.2%), with 11 (1.4%) participants harboring variation in a gene defined as clinically actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. These 25 individuals self-reported either relevant clinical diagnoses (5); relevant family history or symptoms (13); or no relevant family history, symptoms, or clinical diagnoses (7). A limited carrier screen was performed yielding 15 variants in 48 (6.1%) parents. Parents were also analyzed as mate pairs (n=365) to identify cases in which both parents were carriers for the same recessive disease, yielding three such cases (0.8%), two of which had children with the relevant recessive disease. Four participants had two findings (one carrier and one noncarrier variant). In total, 71 of the 789 enrolled parents (9.0%) received secondary findings.; CONCLUSION: We provide an overview of the rates and types of clinically relevant secondary findings, which may be useful in the design and implementation of research and clinical sequencing efforts to identify such findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: Genomic sequencing is becoming increasingly accessible, highlighting the need to understand the social and psychological factors that drive interest in receiving testing results. These decisions may depend on perceived descriptive norms (how most others behave) and injunctive norms (what is approved of by others). We predicted that descriptive norms would be directly associated with intentions to learn genomic sequencing results, whereas injunctive norms would be associated indirectly, via attitudes. These differential associations with intentions versus attitudes were hypothesized to be strongest when individuals held ambivalent attitudes toward obtaining results.; METHOD: Participants enrolled in a genomic sequencing trial (n = 372) reported intentions to learn medically actionable, nonmedically actionable, and carrier sequencing results. Descriptive norms items referenced other study participants. Injunctive norms were analyzed separately for close friends and family members. Attitudes, attitudinal ambivalence, and sociodemographic covariates were also assessed.; RESULTS: In structural equation models, both descriptive norms and friend injunctive norms were associated with intentions to receive all sequencing results (ps < .004). Attitudes consistently mediated all friend injunctive norms-intentions associations, but not the descriptive norms-intentions associations. Attitudinal ambivalence moderated the association between friend injunctive norms (p ≤ .001), but not descriptive norms (p = .16), and attitudes. Injunctive norms were significantly associated with attitudes when ambivalence was high, but were unrelated when ambivalence was low. Results replicated for family injunctive norms.; CONCLUSIONS: Descriptive and injunctive norms play roles in genomic sequencing decisions. Considering mediators and moderators of these processes enhances ability to optimize use of normative information to support informed decision making.

AB Precision medicine is an approach to disease prevention and treatment that takes into account genetic variability and environmental and lifestyle influences that are unique to each patient. It facilitates stratification of patient populations that vary in their susceptibility to disease and response to therapy. Shared databases and the implementation of new technology systems designed to advance the integration of this information will enable health care providers to more accurately predict and customize prevention and treatment strategies for patients. Although precision medicine has had a limited impact in most areas of medicine, it has been shown to be an increasingly successful approach to cancer therapy. Despite early promising results targeting aberrant signaling pathways or inhibitors designed to block tumor-driven processes such as angiogenesis, limited success emphasizes the need to discover new biomarkers and treatment targets that are more reliable in predicting response to therapy and result in better health outcomes. Recent successes in the use of immunity-inducing antibodies have stimulated increased interest in the use of precision immunotherapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using next-generation sequencing, the precise profiling of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has great promise to identify hypoimmunogenic cancer that would benefit from a rationally designed combinatorial approach. Continued interrogation of tumors will reveal new actionable targets with increasing therapeutic efficacy and fulfill the promise of precision therapy of head and neck cancer.

AB Since Hurricane Katrina there has been a movement across the U.S. to examine best practice for disaster response within the aging population. However, little is known about the experience of natural disasters from the perspective of family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). In this exploratory, qualitative study, family caregivers (n=27) were interviewed about their experience with the historic 2015 South Carolina flood. By using thematic analysis, themes were identified to better understand what unique challenges caregivers of person with ADRD experienced. While many caregivers stated they had experienced a natural disaster previously, none had ever done so in their current caregiving role. The caregiving role affected their ability to prepare for the storm and influenced their decision-making regarding evacuation and utilization of recovery resources. Thus, caregivers were confronted by a "perfect storm" of circumstances and uncertainty. Family caregivers need to have actionable emergency plans for disasters that are specific to their role as caregivers of persons with ADRD. Study implications also suggest the role social work professionals can have in educating, advocating, evaluating, and coordinating support to assist caregivers of persons with ADRD as a potentially vulnerable and at-risk population during all phases of disaster.

AB Since Garrod's first description of alkaptonuria in 1902, and newborn screening for phenylketonuria introduced in the 1960s, P4 medicine (preventive, predictive, personalized, and participatory) has been a reality for the clinician serving patients with inherited metabolic diseases. The era of high-throughput technologies promises to accelerate its scale dramatically. Genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, glycomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics offer an amazing opportunity for holistic investigation and contextual pathophysiologic understanding of inherited metabolic diseases for precise diagnosis and tailored treatment. While each of the -omics technologies is important to systems biology, some are more mature than others. Exome sequencing is emerging as a reimbursed test in clinics around the world, and untargeted metabolomics has the potential to serve as a single biochemical testing platform. The challenge lies in the integration and cautious interpretation of these big data, with translation into clinically meaningful information and/or actionfor our patients. A daunting but exciting task for the clinician; we provide clinical cases to illustrate the importance of his/her role as the connector between physicians, laboratory experts and researchers in the basic, computer, and clinical sciences. Open collaborations, data sharing, functional assays, and model organisms play a key role in the validation of -omics discoveries. Having all the right expertise at the table when discussing the diagnostic approach and individualized management plan according to the information yielded by -omics investigations (e.g., actionable mutations, novel therapeutic interventions), is the stepping stone of P4 medicine. Patient participation and the adjustment of the medical team's plan to his/her and the family's wishes most certainly is the capstone. Are you ready?

AB MLL-fusions represent a large group of leukemia drivers, whose diversity originates from the vast molecular heterogeneity of C-terminal fusion partners of MLL. While studies of selected MLL-fusions have revealed critical molecular pathways, unifying mechanisms across all MLL-fusions remain poorly understood. We present the first comprehensive survey of protein-protein interactions of seven distantly related MLL-fusion proteins. Functional investigation of 128 conserved MLL-fusion-interactors identifies a specific role for the lysine methyltransferase SETD2 in MLL-leukemia. SETD2 loss causes growth arrest and differentiation of AML cells, and leads to increased DNA damage. In addition to its role in H3K36 tri-methylation, SETD2 is required to maintain high H3K79 di-methylation and MLL-AF9-binding to critical target genes, such as Hoxa9. SETD2 loss synergizes with pharmacologic inhibition of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L to induce DNA damage, growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. These results uncover a dependency for SETD2 during MLL-leukemogenesis, revealing a novel actionable vulnerability in this disease.

AB Determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.

AB Health care systems primarily focus on patients after they present with disease, not before. The emerging field of precision health encourages disease prevention and earlier detection by monitoring health and disease based on an individual's risk. Active participation in health care can be encouraged with continuous health-monitoring devices, providing a higher-resolution picture of human health and disease. However, the development of monitoring technologies must prioritize the collection of actionable data and long-term user engagement.

AB Advances in genomics and proteomics drive precision medicine by providing actionable genetic alterations and molecularly targeted therapies, respectively. While genomic analysis and medicinal chemistry have advanced patient stratification with treatments tailored to the genetic profile of a patient's tumor, proteomic targeting has the potential to enhance the therapeutic index of drugs like poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. PARP inhibitors in breast and ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations have shown promise. About 10% of the patients who received Olaparib (PARP inhibitor) showed adverse side effects including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and in some cases resulted in myelodysplastic syndrome, indicating that off-target effects were substantial in these patients. Through proteomic analysis, our lab previously identified plectin, a cytolinker protein that mislocalized onto the cell surface during malignant transformation of healthy ovarian tissue. This cancer specific phenotype allowed us to image pancreatic cancer successfully using plectin targeted peptide (PTP) conjugated to nanoparticles or displayed on capsid protein of adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles. Objective: The goal of this study was to integrate the available pharmacogenomics and proteomic data to develop effective anti-tumor therapies using a targeted drug delivery approach. Methods: Plectin expression and localization in human ovarian tumor specimens were analyzed followed by in vitro confirmation of cell surface plectin localization in healthy and ovarian cancer cell lines. PTP-conjugated liposomes were prepared and their specificity for plectin+ cells was determined in vitro and in vivo. A remote loading method was employed to encapsulate a PARP inhibitor (AZ7379) into liposomes. An ideal buffer exchange method and remote loading conditions were determined based on the amount of lipid and drug recovered at the end of a remote loading process. Finally, in vivo tumor growth studies were performed to determine the efficacy of PTP liposomes in preventing PARP activity in mice bearing OVCAR8 (high grade epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)) tumors. Results: PTP liposomal AZ7379 delivery not only enhanced PARP inhibition but also resulted in decelerated tumor growth in mice bearing subcutaneous and intraperitoneal OVCAR8 tumors. In mice bearing subcutaneous or intraperitoneal tumors, treatment with PTP liposomes resulted in a 3- and 1.7-fold decrease in tumor volume, respectively, compared to systemic drug treatment. Conclusion: Targeted drug delivery assisted by genomic and proteomic data provides an adaptable model system that can be extended to effectively treat other cancers and diseases.

AB INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer is a common solid tumor. Outcomes are poor in advanced disease, with few novel clinical therapeutics introduced over the previous several decades. Otto Warburg's original hypothesis that cancer cells use aerobic glycolysis to produce ATP instead of traditional oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria was a landmark discovery in its time. Recent studies indicate metabolic changes in cancer are far more complex than originally anticipated though. The purpose of this review is to understand metabolic changes that occur in bladder cancer, how targeting these changes could potentially be used therapeutically, and the current treatments that target these metabolic changes METHODS: A literature review on recent advances in cancer metabolism with an emphasis on bladder cancer was performed.; RESULTS: Significant metabolic change occurs in bladder cancer; however, these changes associated are not yet well understood. Therapeutic development in this area is growing and a diverse array of actionable targets such as mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial metabolic enzymes and cellular signaling proteins have been identified. Many of these proteins may also be involved in chemoresistance.; CONCLUSION: Metabolism is a growing area of therapeutic interest in bladder cancer, but more studies are required to advance therapeutic development in this area.

AB This workshop targeted opportunities to stimulate transformative innovation in organ transplantation. Participants reached consensus regarding the following: (1) Mechanisms are needed to improve the coordination of policy and oversight activities, given overlapping responsibilities for transplantation and clinical investigation among federal agencies. Innovative clinical trials span traditional administrative boundaries and include stakeholders with diverse interests. Participants identified the need for a governmental interagency working group to coordinate nationwide transplant-related activities. (2) Improvements are required in clinical metrics for transplantation, with alignment of performance goals across transplantation organizations and any development of data requirements being consistent with those goals. Database coordination among clinical centers, organ procurement organizations, regulatory agencies, and payers would facilitate research and better inform policy. New data requirements should provide actionable insights into clinical performance. (3) Innovative research seen as potentially adversely affecting Program-Specific Reports may reduce centers' participation. Cutting-edge research requires mitigation of risk-aversive behaviors created by reporting of clinical outcomes data. Participants proposed a new review process in advance of implementation of clinical trials to guide "carve-outs" of transplant center outcomes data from Program-Specific Reports. Clinical transplantation will be advanced by the development of a shared and comprehensive research agenda to facilitate coordination of research and policy. © 2018 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.

AB PURPOSE: Despite concerted actions to streamline care transitions, the journey from hospital to home remains hazardous for patients and caregivers. Remarkably little is known about the patient and caregiver experience during care transitions, the services they need, or the outcomes they value. The aims of this study were to (1) describe patient and caregiver experiences during care transitions and (2) characterize patient and caregiver desired outcomes of care transitions and the health services associated with them.; METHODS: We interviewed 138 patients and 110 family caregivers recruited from 6 health networks across the United States. We conducted 34 homogenous focus groups (103 patients, 65 caregivers) and 80 key informant interviews (35 patients, 45 caregivers). Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using principles of grounded theory to identify themes and the relationship between them.; RESULTS: Patients and caregivers identified 3 desired outcomes of care transition services: (1) to feel cared for and cared about by medical providers, (2) to have unambiguous accountability from the health care system, and (3) to feel prepared and capable of implementing care plans. Five care transition services or provider behaviors were linked to achieving these outcomes: (1) using empathic language and gestures, (2) anticipating the patient's needs to support self-care at home, (3) collaborative discharge planning, (4) providing actionable information, and (5) providing uninterrupted care with minimal handoffs.; CONCLUSIONS: Clear accountability, care continuity, and caring attitudes across the care continuum are important outcomes for patients and caregivers. When these outcomes are achieved, care is perceived as excellent and trustworthy. Otherwise, the care transition is experienced as transactional and unsafe, and leaves patients and caregivers feeling abandoned by the health care system. © 2018 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Germline and tumor pharmacogenomics impact drug responses, but germline markers less commonly guide oncology prescribing. The authors hypothesized that a critical number of clinically actionable germline pharmacogenomic associations exist, representing clinical implementation opportunities.; METHODS: In total, 125 oncology drugs were analyzed for positive germline pharmacogenomic associations in journals with impact factors ≥5. Studies were assessed for design and genotyping quality, clinically relevant outcomes, statistical rigor, and evidence of drug-gene effects. Associations from studies of high methodologic quality were deemed potentially clinically actionable, and translational summaries were written as point-of-care clinical decision support (CDS) tools and formally evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.; RESULTS: The authors identified germline pharmacogenomic results for 56 of 125 oncology drugs (45%) across 173 publications. Actionable associations were detected for 12 drugs, including 6 that had germline pharmacogenomic information within US Food and Drug Administration labels or published guidelines (capecitabine/fluorouracil/dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [DPYD], irinotecan/uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 [UGT1A1], mercaptopurine/thioguanine/thiopurine S-methyltransferase [TPMT], tamoxifen/cytochrome P450 [CYP] family 2 subfamily D member 6 [CYP2D6]), and 6 others were novel (asparaginase/nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 [NFATC2]/human leukocyte antigen D-related beta1 [HLA-DRB1], cisplatin/acylphosphatase 2 [ACYP2], doxorubicin/adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily C member 2/Rac family small guanosine triphosphatase 2/neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 [ABCC2/RAC2/NCF4], lapatinib/human leukocyte antigen DQ alpha1 [HLA-DQA1], sunitinib/cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 5 [CYP3A5], vincristine/centrosomal protein 72 [CEP72]). By using AGREE II, the developed CDS summaries had high mean±standard deviation scores (maximum score, 100) for scope and purpose (92.7±5.1) and rigour of development (87.6±7.4) and moderate yet robust scores for clarity of presentation (58.6±25.1) and applicability (55.9±24.6). The overall mean guideline quality score was 5.2±1.0 (maximum score, 7). Germline pharmacogenomic CDS summaries for these 12 drugs were recommended for implementation.; CONCLUSIONS: Several oncology drugs have actionable germline pharmacogenomic information, justifying their delivery through institutional pharmacogenomic implementations to determine clinical utility.

AB Immunoediting caused by antitumor immunity drives tumor cells to acquire refractory phenotypes. We demonstrated previously that tumor antigen-specific T cells edit these cells such that they become resistant to CTL killing and enrich NANOGhigh cancer stem cell-like cells. In this study, we show that synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3), a member of the Cor1 family, is overexpressed in immunoedited cells and upregulates NANOG by hyperactivating the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 axis. The SCP3-cyclin D1-CDK4/6 axis was preserved across various types of human cancer and correlated negatively with progression-free survival of cervical cancer patients. Targeting CDK4/6 with the inhibitor palbociclib reversed multiaggressive phenotypes of SCP3high immunoedited tumor cells and led to long-term control of the disease. Collectively, our findings establish a firm molecular link of multiaggressiveness among SCP3, NANOG, cyclin D1, and CDK4/6 and identify CDK4/6 inhibitors as actionable drugs for controlling SCP3high immune-refractory cancer.Significance: These findings reveal cyclin D1-CDK4/6 inhibition as an effective strategy for controlling SCP3high immune-refractroy cancer.

AB Peer instruction, a form of active learning, is generally defined as an opportunity for peers to discuss ideas or to share answers to questions in an in-class environment, where they also have opportunities for further interactions with their instructor. When implementing peer instruction, instructors have many choices to make about group design, assignment format, and grading, among others. Ideally, these choices can be informed by research about the impact of these components of peer instruction on student learning. This essay describes an online, evidence-based teaching guide published by CBE-Life Sciences Education at http://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/peer-instruction . The guide provides condensed summaries of key research findings organized by teaching choices, summaries of and links to research articles and other resources, and actionable advice in the form of a checklist for instructors. In addition to describing key features of the guide, this essay also identifies areas in which further empirical studies are warranted.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Choosing the optimal treatment approach for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) demands that oncologists assess both clinical and genomic variables and individualize care based upon the findings. Clinically, choices depend on assessing the side of the colon in which the primary tumor originates, the sites and burden of metastatic disease, the patient's performance status, and their individual comorbidities. Genomic assessment of the tumor to discern the mutational status of genes such as RAS/RAF, HER2, and TRK, as well as assessing whether tumors have defective mismatch repair (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), all factor in to potential treatment options and can determine clinical trial eligibility. Metastasectomy may be an option for patients with a low burden of disease and accessible liver- or lung-limited metastases. In some unresectable cases, systemic therapy with a FOLFOX- or FOLFIRI-based regimen with or without a biologic agent can lead to sufficient disease reduction to make a patient eligible for resection of metastatic disease. Tumor sidedness and RAS mutational status guide which biologic we add to the initial chemotherapy backbone, with patients with left-sided, RAS wild-type (WT) tumors receiving anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy and patients with right-sided tumors or those with RAS mutations receiving bevacizumab. In patients with tumors that manifest microsatellite instability or deficient mismatch repair, we typically administer checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab after progression on irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based therapies. In patients with progressive disease, we routinely send tumor tissue for next generation sequencing (NGS) to assess for the presence of actionable genomic alterations such as HER2, BRAF, and TRK fusions and offer them the option of enrollment on clinical trials with agents targeting those or other identified alterations.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a long-lasting orphan disease in terms of little therapeutic progress during the past several decades and still the standard of care remains chemotherapy. Experimental discovery of molecular signatures including the 'BRCAness' highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC, generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread. Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC.

AB Citizen science provides quantitative results to support environmental health assessments (EHAs), but standardized approaches do not currently exist to translate findings into actionable solutions. The emergence of low-cost portable sensor technologies and proliferation of publicly available datasets provides unparalleled access to supporting evidence; yet data collection, analysis, interpretation, visualization, and communication are subjective approaches that must be tailored to a decision-making audience capable of improving environmental health. A decade of collaborative efforts and two citizen science projects contributed to three lessons learned and a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that address the complexities of environmental health and interpersonal relations often encountered in citizen science EHAs. Each project followed a structured step-by-step process in order to compare and contrast methods and approaches. These lessons and FAQs provide advice to translate citizen science research into actionable solutions in the context of a diverse range of environmental health issues and local stakeholders.

AB BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, Ethiopia has made impressive national improvements in health outcomes, including reductions in maternal, neonatal, infant, and child mortality attributed in large part to their Health Extension Program (HEP). As this program continues to evolve and improve, understanding the unit cost of health extension worker (HEW) services is fundamental to planning for future growth and ensuring adequate financial support to deliver effective primary care throughout the country.; METHODS: We sought to examine and report the data needed to generate a HEW fee schedule that would allow for full cost recovery for HEW services. Using HEW activity data and estimates from national studies and local systems we were able to estimate salary costs and the average time spent by an HEW per patient/community encounter for each type of services associated with specific users. Using this information, we created separate fee schedules for activities in urban and rural settings with two estimates of non-salary multipliers to calculate the total cost for HEW services.; RESULTS: In the urban areas, the HEW fees for full cost recovery of the provision of services (including salary, supplies, and overhead costs) ranged from 55.1 birr to 209.1 birr per encounter. The rural HEW fees ranged from 19.6 birr to 219.4 birr.; CONCLUSION: Efforts to support health system strengthening in low-income settings have often neglected to generate adequate, actionable data on the costs of primary care services. In this study, we have combined time-motion and available financial data to generate a fee schedule that allows for full cost recovery of the provision of services through billable health education and service encounters provided by Ethiopian HEWs. This may be useful in other country settings where managers seek to make evidence-informed planning and resource allocation decisions to address high burden of disease within the context of weak administrative data systems and severe financial constraints. © 2018 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

AB Macrophages are susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection despite abundant expression of antiviral proteins. Perhaps the most important antiviral protein is the restriction factor sterile alpha motif domain and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). We investigated the role of SAMHD1 and its phospho-dependent regulation in the context of HIV-1 infection in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and the ability of various interferons (IFNs) and pharmacologic agents to modulate SAMHD1. Here we show that stimulation by type I, type II, and to a lesser degree, type III interferons share activation of SAMHD1 via dephosphorylation at threonine-592 as a consequence of signaling. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), a known effector kinase for SAMHD1, was downregulated at the protein level by all IFN types tested. Pharmacologic inhibition or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CDK1 phenocopied the effects of IFN on SAMHD1. A panel of FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors potently induced activation of SAMHD1 and subsequent HIV-1 inhibition. The viral restriction imposed via IFNs or dasatinib could be overcome through depletion of SAMHD1, indicating that their effects are exerted primarily through this pathway. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 activation, but not transcriptional upregulation or protein induction, is the predominant mechanism of HIV-1 restriction induced by type I, type II, and type III IFN signaling in macrophages. Furthermore, SAMHD1 activation presents a pharmacologically actionable target through which HIV-1 infection can be subverted.IMPORTANCE Our experimental results demonstrate that SAMHD1 dephosphorylation at threonine-592 represents a central mechanism of HIV-1 restriction that is common to the three known families of IFNs. While IFN types I and II were potent inhibitors of HIV-1, type III IFN showed modest to undetectable activity. Regulation of SAMHD1 by IFNs involved changes in phosphorylation status but not in protein levels. Phosphorylation of SAMHD1 in macrophages occurred at least in part via CDK1. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors similarly induced SAMHD1 dephosphorylation, which protects macrophages from HIV-1 in a SAMHD1-dependent manner. SAMHD1 is a critical restriction factor regulating HIV-1 infection of macrophages. Copyright © 2018 Szaniawski et al.

AB TWIST1 (TW) is a bHLH transcription factor (TF) and master regulator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Invitro, TW promotes mesenchymal change, invasion, and self-renewal in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. However, the potential therapeutic relevance of TW has not been established through loss-of-function studies in human GBM cell xenograft models. The effects of TW loss of function (gene editing and knockdown) on inhibition of tumorigenicity of U87MG and GBM4 glioma stem cells were tested in orthotopic xenograft models and conditional knockdown in established flank xenograft tumors. RNAseq and the analysis of tumors investigated putative TW-associated mechanisms. Multiple bioinformatic tools revealed significant alteration of ECM, membrane receptors, signaling transduction kinases, and cytoskeleton dynamics leading to identification of PI3K/AKT signaling. We experimentally show alteration of AKT activity and periostin (POSTN) expression invivo and/or invitro. For the first time, we show that effect of TW knockout inhibits AKT activity in U87MG cells invivo independent of PTEN mutation. The clinical relevance of TW and candidate mechanisms was established by analysis of the TCGA and ENCODE databases. TW expression was associated with decreased patient survival and LASSO regression analysis identified POSTN as one of top targets of TW in human GBM. While we previously demonstrated the role of TW in promoting EMT and invasion of glioma cells, these studies provide direct experimental evidence supporting protumorigenic role of TW independent of invasion invivo and the therapeutic relevance of targeting TW in human GBM. Further, the role of TW driving POSTN expression and AKT signaling suggests actionable targets, which could be leveraged to mitigate the oncogenic effects of TW in GBM. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains incurable despite the approval of several new treatments. Identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets to enable personalization of CRPC therapy, with the aim of maximizing therapeutic responses and minimizing toxicity in patients, is urgently needed. Prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance are frequently driven by aberrantly activated kinase signalling pathways that are amenable to pharmacological inhibition. Personalized phosphoproteomics, which enables the analysis of signalling networks in individual tumours, is a promising approach to advance personalized therapy by discovering biomarkers of pathway activity and clinically actionable targets. Several technologies for global and targeted phosphoproteomic analysis exist, each with its own strengths and shortcomings. Global discovery phosphoproteomics is predominantly conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with data-dependent or data-independent acquisition technologies. Multiplexed targeted phosphoproteomics can be divided into platforms based on mass spectrometry or antibodies, including selected or parallel reaction monitoring and triggered by offset, multiplexed, accurate mass, high-resolution, absolute quantification (known as TOMAHAQ) or forward-phase or reverse-phase protein arrays, respectively. Several obstacles still need to be overcome before the full potential of phosphoproteomics can be realized in routine clinical practice, but a future phosphoproteomics-centric trans-omic profiling approach should enable optimized personalized CRPC management through improved biomarkers and targeted treatments.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of screening patients at increased risk for hereditary cancer syndromes with an extended panel of cancer predisposition genes to identify actionable genetic mutations.; METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients presenting to a multidisciplinary cancer program for genetic counseling and testing from January 2015 to December 2016. Individuals presenting to the program were identified as at-risk by a personal or family history of cancer, by their health care provider, or by self-referral. All participants met current National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for genetic risk evaluation for hereditary cancer. The results of testing and its implications for management, based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, were recorded.; RESULTS: Of 670 at-risk patients who underwent genetic testing, 66 (9.9%) had BRCA-limited testing; of these, 26 of 670 (3.9%) had a deleterious or likely pathogenic mutation. Expanded panel testing was done for 560 of the 670 patients (83.4%), and abnormal results were found in 65 of 670 (9.7%); non-BRCA mutations (predominantly CHEK2) were found in 49 of the 65 (75%). Abnormal genetic testing was associated with increased surveillance in 96% of those with deleterious mutations, whereas negative testing for a known familial mutation in 45 patients was associated with a downgrade of their risk and reduction of subsequent surveillance and management.; CONCLUSION: Guideline-based management is frequently altered by genetic testing, including panel testing, in patients at risk for cancer. We recommend that obstetrics and gynecology providers routinely refer at-risk patients for genetic counseling and testing when clinically appropriate.

AB The basic physics of earthquakes is such that strong ground motion cannot be expected from an earthquake unless the earthquake itself is very close or has grown to be very large. We use simple seismological relationships to calculate the minimum time that must elapse before such ground motion can be expected at a distance from the earthquake, assuming that the earthquake magnitude is not predictable. Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems are in operation or development for many regions around the world, with the goal of providing enough warning of incoming ground shaking to allow people and automated systems to take protective actions to mitigate losses. However, the question of how much warning time is physically possible for specified levels of ground motion has not been addressed. We consider a zero-latency EEW system to determine possible warning times a user could receive in an ideal case. In this case, the only limitation on warning time is the time required for the earthquake to evolve and the time for strong ground motion to arrive at a user's location. We find that users who wish to be alerted at lower ground motion thresholds will receive more robust warnings with longer average warning times than users who receive warnings for higher ground motion thresholds. EEW systems have the greatest potential benefit for users willing to take action at relatively low ground motion thresholds, whereas users who set relatively high thresholds for taking action are less likely to receive timely and actionable information.

AB BACKGROUND: Because imaging has a high sensitivity to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and tissue biopsies carry risks such as bleeding, the latter are often not performed in HCC. Blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis can identify somatic alterations, but its utility has not been characterized in HCC.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 14 patients with advanced HCC (digital ctDNA sequencing [68 genes]). Mutant relative to wild-type allele fraction was calculated.; RESULTS: All patients (100%) had somatic alterations (median= 3 alterations/patient [range, 1-8]); median mutant allele fraction, 0.29% (range, 0.1%-37.77%). Mutations were identified in several genes: TP53 (57% of patients), CTNNB1 (29%), PTEN (7%), CDKN2A (7%), ARID1A (7%), and MET (7%); amplifications, in CDK6 (14%), EGFR (14%), MYC (14%), BRAF (7%), RAF1 (7%), FGFR1 (7%), CCNE1 (7%), PIK3CA (7%), and ERBB2/HER2 (7%). Eleven patients (79%) had ≥1 theoretically actionable alteration. No two patients had identical genomic portfolios, suggesting the need for customized treatment. A patient with a CDKN2A-inactivating and a CTNNB1-activating mutation received matched treatment: palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and celecoxib (COX-2/Wnt inhibitor); des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin level decreased by 84% at 2 months (1,410 to 242 ng/mL [normal: ≤7.4 ng/mL]; alpha fetoprotein [AFP] low at baseline). A patient with a PTEN-inactivating and a MET-activating mutation (an effect suggested by in silico molecular dynamic simulations) received sirolimus (mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor) and cabozantinib (MET inhibitor); AFP declined by 63% (8,320 to 3,045 ng/mL [normal: 0-15 ng/mL]).; CONCLUSION: ctDNA derived from noninvasive blood tests can provide exploitable genomic profiles in patients with HCC.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study reports that blood-derived circulating tumor DNA can provide therapeutically exploitable genomic profiles in hepatocellular cancer, a malignancy that is known to be difficult to biopsy. © AlphaMed Press 2018.

AB Although endoscopy is a sophisticated technique for evaluating patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the single diagnostic test that enables the most comprehensive assessment for GERD is a well-performed video esophagram. Not only does the barium study permit assessment of morphologic abnormalities in the pharynx and esophagus, but also oropharyngeal swallowing function, esophageal motility, and gastroesophageal reflux. These factors are especially important for detection of anatomic findings such as strictures and hernias, for assessment of esophageal motility before and after fundoplication, and for excluding conditions that mimic GERD. Thus, esophagography and esophagoscopy are complementary procedures that provide a more comprehensive and therapeutically actionable plan for patients with GERD than either diagnostic test alone.

AB Teaching and assessing trainees' professionalism now represents an explicit expectation for Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education-accredited radiology programs. Challenges to meeting this expectation include variability in defining the construct of professionalism; limits of traditional teaching and assessment methods, used for competencies historically more prominent in medical education, for professionalism; and emerging expectations for credible and feasible professionalism teaching and assessment practices in the current context of health-care training and practice. This article identifies promising teaching resources and methods that can be used strategically to augment traditional teaching of the cognitive basis for professionalism, including role modeling, case-based scenarios, debriefing, simulations, narrative medicine (storytelling), guided discussions, peer-assisted learning, and reflective practice. This article also summarizes assessment practices intended to promote learning, as well as to inform how and when to assess trainees as their professional identities develop over time, settings, and autonomous practice, particularly in terms of measurable behaviors. This includes assessment tools (including mini observations, critical incident reports, and appreciative inquiry) for authentic assessment in the workplace; engaging multiple sources (self-, peer, other health professionals, and patients) in assessment; and intentional practices for trainees to take responsibility for seeking our actionable feedback and reflection. This article examines the emerging evidence of the feasibility and value added of assessment of medical competency milestones, including professionalism, coordinated by the Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education in radiology and other medical specialties. Radiology has a strategic opportunity to contribute to scholarship and inform policies in professionalism teaching and assessment practices.

AB OBJECTIVE: Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers for predicting therapeutic response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The synovium may unlock critical information for determining efficacy, since a reduction in the numbers of sublining synovial macrophages remains the most reproducible biomarker. Thus, a clinically actionable method for the collection of synovial tissue, which can be analyzed using high-throughput strategies, must become a reality. This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of utilizing synovial biopsies as a precision medicine-based approach for patients with RA.; METHODS: Rheumatologists at 6 US academic sites were trained in minimally invasive ultrasound-guided synovial tissue biopsy. Biopsy specimens obtained from patients with RA and synovial tissue from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were subjected to histologic analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). An optimized protocol for digesting synovial tissue was developed to generate high-quality RNA-seq libraries from isolated macrophage populations. Associations were determined between macrophage transcriptional profiles and clinical parameters in RA patients.; RESULTS: Patients with RA reported minimal adverse effects in response to synovial biopsy. Comparable RNA quality was observed from synovial tissue and isolated macrophages between patients with RA and patients with OA. Whole tissue samples from patients with RA demonstrated a high degree of transcriptional heterogeneity. In contrast, the transcriptional profile of isolated RA synovial macrophages highlighted different subpopulations of patients and identified 6 novel transcriptional modules that were associated with disease activity and therapy.; CONCLUSION: Performance of synovial tissue biopsies by rheumatologists in the US is feasible and generates high-quality samples for research. Through the use of cutting-edge technologies to analyze synovial biopsy specimens in conjunction with corresponding clinical information, a precision medicine-based approach for patients with RA is attainable. © 2018, American College of Rheumatology.

AB BACKGROUND: Raising Well (RW) was initiated in 2015 by Envolve PeopleCare at the request of health plans seeking a solution to work with families on Medicaid that have a child with overweight or obesity. RW uses expert clinical coaches via phone contact to deliver an educational intervention promoting lifestyle change to families with at least one overweight or obese child in an eligible Medicaid health plan. This gives RW significant potential for reach and population impact. This project aimed to understand how to maximize this impact by exploring perspectives of RW, using a conceptual framework informed by the Conceptual Model of Implementation Research, including assessment of the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of RW; determining satisfaction among those experiencing coaching; identifying reasons individuals do not participate; and developing recommendations to enhance interest and participation.; METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 70 RW-eligible families across four states, who were described as: active participants, respondents who dropped or stopped RW, and RW non-participants. Following the interviews, the transcripts were coded inductively and deductively using a grounded theory approach, considering themes from the conceptual framework; themes also emerged from the data.; RESULTS: From this sample, 19 families reported to be active coaching participants, 24 had dropped coaching, and 27 were RW non-participants. A number of themes were identified. Feasibility themes included coaches' flexibility and willingness to work with the family's schedule. Acceptability themes suggest providing actionable strategies tailored to the family's context and needs, beyond just nutrition information and tips, early in the coaching relationship so the family perceives a benefit for continued participation. With regard to appropriateness, families were also interested in other methods of communication including email, texting, and in person visits. Access to resources for activity and healthy eating in their local community was also recommended.; CONCLUSIONS: RW has the potential to improve health and promote wellness. To enhance the impact of this program, RW could incorporate these findings to promote feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness and improve program implementation. Strategies may include modifying the information provided or the mode of delivering the information.

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors exhibit potentially actionable genetic alterations against which targeted therapies have been effective in treatment of other cancers. However, these therapies have largely failed in GBM patients. A notable example is kinase inhibitors of EGFR, which display poor clinical efficacy despite overexpression and/or mutation of EGFR in >50% of GBM. In addressing this issue, preclinical models may be limited by the inability to accurately replicate pathophysiologic interactions of GBM cells with unique aspects of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM), which is relatively enriched in hyaluronic acid (HA) and flexible. In this study, we present a brain-mimetic biomaterial ECM platform for 3D culturing of patient-derived GBM cells, with improved pathophysiologic properties as an experimental model. Compared with orthotopic xenograft assays, the novel biomaterial cultures we developed better preserved the physiology and kinetics of acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibition than gliomasphere cultures. Orthogonal modulation of both HA content and mechanical properties of biomaterial scaffolds was required to achieve this result. Overall, our findings show how specific interactions between GBM cell receptors and scaffold components contribute significantly to resistance to the cytotoxic effects of EGFR inhibition.Significance: Three-dimensional culture scaffolds of glioblastoma provide a better physiological representation over current methods of patient-derived cell culture and xenograft models.

AB Purpose: Pediatric cancers are often difficult to classify and can be complex to treat. To ensure precise diagnostics and identify relevant treatment targets, we implemented comprehensive molecular profiling of consecutive pediatric patients with cancer relapse. We evaluated the clinical impact of extensive molecular profiling by assessing the frequency of identified biological onco-drivers, altered diagnosis, and/or identification of new relevant targeted therapies. Patients and Methods: Forty-six tumor samples (44 fresh-frozen; two formalin-fixed paraffin embedded), two bone marrow aspirates, three cerebrospinal fluid samples, and one archived DNA were obtained from 48 children (0-17 years; median 9.5) with relapsed or refractory cancer, where the disease was rapidly progressing in spite of their current treatment or they had exhausted all treatment options. The samples were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNAseq), transcriptome arrays, and SNP arrays. Final reports were available within 3-4 weeks after patient inclusion and included mutation status, a description of copy number alterations, differentially expressed genes, and gene fusions, as well as suggestions for targeted treatment. Results: Of the 48 patients, 33 had actionable findings. The most efficient method for the identification of actionable findings was WES (39%), followed by SNP array (37%). Of note, gene fusions were identified by RNAseq in 21% of the samples. Eleven findings led to clinical intervention, i.e., oncogenetic counseling, targeted treatment, and treatment based on changed diagnosis. Four patients received compassionate use targeted therapy. Six patients experienced direct benefits in the form of stable disease or response. Conclusion: The application of comprehensive genetic diagnostics in children with recurrent cancers allowed for discovery and implementation of effective targeted therapies and hereby improvement of outcome in some patients.

AB PURPOSE: As genome sequencing moves from research to clinical practice, sequencing technologies focused on "medically actionable" targets are being promoted for preventive screening despite the dearth of systematic evidence of risks and benefits and of criteria for selection of screening subjects. This study investigates researchers' and research participants' perceptions of these issues within the context of a preventive genomic screening study, GeneScreen.; METHODS: We recorded researcher deliberations regarding age eligibility criteria and the risks and benefits of screening, and conducted interviews with 50 GeneScreen participants about their motivations for joining and their perceptions of risks and benefits.; RESULTS: Researchers made assumptions about who would want and benefit from screening based on age. After discussion, researchers opted not to have an upper age limit for enrollment. Participants of all ages perceived similar benefits, including prevention, treatment, and cascade testing, and similar risks, such as insurance discrimination and worry.; CONCLUSION: While clinical benefits of preventive genomic screening for older adults are debatable, our respondents perceived a range of benefits of screening in both clinical and research settings. Researchers and clinicians should carefully consider decisions about whether to exclude older adults and whether to provide information about benefits and risks across age groups.

AB PURPOSE: Fresh-frozen (FF) tissue is the optimal source of DNA for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of cancer patients. However, it is not always available, limiting the widespread application of WGS in clinical practice. We explored the viability of using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, available routinely for cancer patients, as a source of DNA for clinical WGS.; METHODS: We conducted a prospective study using DNAs from matched FF, FFPE, and peripheral blood germ-line specimens collected from 52 cancer patients (156 samples) following routine diagnostic protocols. We compared somatic variants detected in FFPE and matching FF samples.; RESULTS: We found the single-nucleotide variant agreement reached 71% across the genome and somatic copy-number alterations (CNAs) detection from FFPE samples was suboptimal (0.44 median correlation with FF) due to nonuniform coverage. CNA detection was improved significantly with lower reverse crosslinking temperature in FFPE DNA extraction (80°C or 65°C depending on the methods). Our final data showed somatic variant detection from FFPE for clinical decision making is possible. We detected 98% of clinically actionable variants (including 30/31 CNAs).; CONCLUSION: We present the first prospective WGS study of cancer patients using FFPE specimens collected in a routine clinical environment proving WGS can be applied in the clinic.

AB PURPOSE: Internationally adopted variant interpretation guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) are generic and require disease-specific refinement. Here we developed CardioClassifier ( http://www.cardioclassifier.org ), a semiautomated decision-support tool for inherited cardiac conditions (ICCs).; METHODS: CardioClassifier integrates data retrieved from multiple sources with user-input case-specific information, through an interactive interface, to support variant interpretation. Combining disease- and gene-specific knowledge with variant observations in large cohorts of cases and controls, we refined 14 computational ACMG criteria and created three ICC-specific rules.; RESULTS: We benchmarked CardioClassifier on 57 expertly curated variants and show full retrieval of all computational data, concordantly activating 87.3% of rules. A generic annotation tool identified fewer than half as many clinically actionable variants (64/219 vs. 156/219, Fisher's P=1.1 * 10-18), with important false positives, illustrating the critical importance of disease and gene-specific annotations. CardioClassifier identified putatively disease-causing variants in 33.7% of 327 cardiomyopathy cases, comparable with leading ICC laboratories. Through addition of manually curated data, variants found in over 40% of cardiomyopathy cases are fully annotated, without requiring additional user-input data.; CONCLUSION: CardioClassifier is an ICC-specific decision-support tool that integrates expertly curated computational annotations with case-specific data to generate fast, reproducible, and interactive variant pathogenicity reports, according to best practice guidelines.

AB Several reviews and case reports have described how information derived from the analysis of genomes are currently included in electronic health records (EHRs) for the purposes of supporting clinical decisions. Since the introduction of this new type of information in EHRs is relatively new (for instance, the widespread adoption of EHRs in the United States is just about a decade old), it is not surprising that a myriad of approaches has been attempted, with various degrees of success. EHR systems undergo much customization to fit the needs of health systems; these approaches have been varied and not always generalizable. The intent of this article is to present a high-level view of these approaches, emphasizing the functionality that they are trying to achieve, and not to advocate for specific solutions, which may become obsolete soon after this review is published. We start by broadly defining the end goal of including genomics in EHRs for healthcare and then explaining the various sources of information that need to be linked to arrive at a clinically actionable genomics analysis using a pharmacogenomics example. In addition, we include discussions on open issues and a vision for the next generation systems that integrate whole genome sequencing and EHRs in a seamless fashion.

AB With the ever-increasing demand for reconfigurability and modularity in manufacturing, industrial work cells are increasingly integrating newer and more diverse technologies to not only support the production of a wider range of parts, but also ease the repair or replacement of faulty systems and components. Complex relationships between different elements of a work cell originate from the integration of multiple layers of hardware and software needed to successfully execute the complicated manufacturing processes. Much work within the science of PHM (prognostics and health management) has been dedicated towards the management of some of this complexity via monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies. The strategic application of PHM technologies has been shown to effectively reduce equipment/process downtime and lower maintenance costs. Part of the challenge of PHM, particularly for manufacturers, is to know exactly where, and how to apply PHM within their work cell operations to gain the maximum actionable information. This problem is further compounded for small to medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) who are typically limited in their resources and investment capital. Effectively designing and implementing PHM requires a fundamental understanding of the overall work cell and its constituent physical components and sub-components. Likewise, understanding the relationships between these physical elements and how these elements relate to one another is critical to determining how the degradation of one element will impact the degradation of another. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is researching various PHM technologies that aim to enhance decision-making at the factory floor to promote smarter maintenance and control strategies. Part of NIST's research focuses on the decomposition of a work cell into a hierarchical structure to understand the physical and functional relationships among the overall system's critical elements. This physical and functional decomposition is a necessity to promote a meaningful rollup of diagnostic and prognostic information from the lower levels to the higher levels of the hierarchy. The hierarchy seeks to encapsulate how the overall system, and its subsequent components, will behave when an element within the system is compromised or begins to fail. Neighboring components and sub-components could be subject to the 'domino effect' or the 'ripple effect', making diagnosing the root cause of a cascade alarms difficult without some reflective model of the system. This paper presents NIST's efforts to develop a hierarchical decomposition methodology that will support PHM design and implementation within a complex work cell.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence and prognostic significance of major driver molecular alterations in adult midline diffuse gliomas (MLG).; METHODS: Adults with histologically proven MLG diagnosed between 1996 and 2017 were identified from our tumor bank, systematically reviewed, and reclassified according to WHO 2016. Targeted sequencing was performed, including determination of H3F3A, HIST1H3B, TERTp, IDH1/2, FGFR1, p16/CDKN2A, and EGFR status.; RESULTS: A total of 116 adult patients (M/F 71/45, median age 46.5 years) with MLG (17 cerebellar, 8 spinal, 30 brainstem, 57 thalamic, and 4 diencephalic nonthalamic) were identified. Most patients had high-grade disease at presentation (grade II: 11%, grade III: 15%, grade IV: 75%). Median overall survival was 17.3 months (14.5-23.8 months). Main molecular alterations observed were TERT promoter, H3F3A, and hotspot FGFR1 (N546 and K656) mutations, in 37%, 34%, and 18% of patients, respectively. IDH1 mutations only affected brainstem gliomas (6/24 vs 0/78; p = 7.5 * 10-5), were mostly non-R132H (contrasting with hemispheric gliomas, p = 0.0001), and were associated with longer survival (54 vs 12 months). TERT promoter mutation (9.1 vs 24.2 months), CDKN2A deletion (9.9 vs 23.8 months), and EGFR amplification (4.3 vs 23.8 months) were associated with shorter survival. Of interest, in contrast with pediatric MLG, H3K27M mutations were not associated with worse prognosis (23 vs 15 months).; CONCLUSIONS: Patients with adult MLG present with unique clinical and molecular characteristics, differing from their pediatric counterparts. The identification of potentially actionable FGFR1 mutations in a subset of adult MLG highlights the importance of comprehensive genomic analysis in this rare affection. © 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

AB Gene mutations play critical roles during cancer development and progression, and therefore represent targets for precision medicine. Here we recapitulated the pharmacogenomic data to delineate novel candidates for actionable mutations and therapeutic target drugs. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that the loss-of-function of SULF2 by mutation (N491K) or inhibition enhanced sorafenib sensitivity in liver cancer cells and in vivo mouse models. This effect was mediated by deregulation of EGFR signaling and downstream expression of LCN2. We also report that the liver cancer patients non-responding to sorafenib treatment exhibit higher expression of SULF2 and LCN2. In conclusion, we suggest that SULF2 plays a key role in sorafenib susceptibility and resistance in liver cancer via deregulation of LCN2. Diagnostic or therapeutic targeting of SULF2 (e.g., OKN-007) and/or LCN2 can be a novel precision strategy for sorafenib treatment in cancer patients.

AB Uveal melanoma is the most common primary cancer of the eye, and despite rapidly emerging insights into the molecular profile of this disease, prognosis of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma remains poor with mortality rates unchanged in over 35years. Early genetic events activate G protein-coupled receptor signaling in nearly all uveal tumors via mutually exclusive mutations in the GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, or PLCB4 genes. A multitude of signaling cascades downstream of G protein activation, including protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, are actionable, and many ongoing clinical trials are targeting these pathways. Additional cytogenetic and genetic changes, however, including chromosome 3 monosomy, mutations in the BAP1 tumor suppressor gene, alterations in the splicing factors SRSF2/SF3B1, and mutations in the translation initiation factor EIF1AX, modulate signaling output in uveal tumors and modify the risk of metastases. Here, we review the complex interactions between genetic, molecular signaling, and prognostic profiles in uveal melanoma; the clinical implications of these interactions; and the latest potential targets for rational therapy. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB The Arabs represent one of the most genetically heterogeneous populations characterized by a high prevalence of Mendelian disorders due to consanguinity. Population-scale genomic datasets provide a unique opportunity to understand the epidemiology of variants associated with differential therapeutic response. We analyzed publicly available genomic data for 1005 Qatari individuals encompassing five subpopulations. The frequencies of known and novel pharmacogenetic variants were compared with global populations. Impact of genetic substructure on the pharmacogenetic landscape of the population was studied. We report an average of three clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variants with FDA-recommended genetic testing per Qatari individual regardless of their genetic ancestry. We observed extensive differences in the frequencies of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variants among the Qatari subpopulations. Our analysis revealed 3579 deleterious pharmacogenetic variants potentially altering the function of 1163 genes associated with 1565 drugs. This study has thus compiled the first comprehensive landscape of pharmacogenetic variants for any Arab population.

AB BACKGROUND: The domestic response to the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic from 2014-2016 provides a unique opportunity to distill lessons learned about health sector planning and operations from those individuals directly involved. This research project aimed to identify and integrate these lessons into an actionable checklist that can improve health sector resilience to future high-consequence infectious disease (HCID) events.; METHODS: Interviews (N=73) were completed with individuals involved in the domestic EVD response in 4 cities (Atlanta, Dallas, New York, and Omaha), and included individuals who worked in academia, emergency management, government, health care, law, media, and public health during the response. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. Two focus groups were then conducted to expand on themes identified in the interviews. Using these themes, an evidence-informed checklist was developed and vetted for completeness and feasibility by an expert advisory group.; RESULTS: Salient themes identified included health care facility issues-specifically identifying assessment and treatment hospitals, isolation and treatment unit layout, waste management, community relations, patient identification, patient isolation, limitations on treatment, laboratories, and research considerations-and health care workforce issues-specifically psychosocial impact, unit staffing, staff training, and proper personal protective equipment.; CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of those involved in the domestic Ebola response provide critical lessons that can help strengthen resilience of health care systems and improve future responses to HCID events.

AB BACKGROUND: With the advancement of next generation sequencing technology, researchers are now able to identify important variants and structural changes in DNA and RNA in cancer patient samples. With this information, we can now correlate specific variants and/or structural changes with actionable therapeutics known to inhibit these variants. We introduce the creation of the IMPACT Web Portal, a new online resource that connects molecular profiles of tumors to approved drugs, investigational therapeutics and pharmacogenetics associated drugs.; RESULTS: IMPACT Web Portal contains a total of 776 drugs connected to 1326 target genes and 435 target variants, fusion, and copy number alterations. The online IMPACT Web Portal allows users to search for various genetic alterations and connects them to three levels of actionable therapeutics. The results are categorized into 3 levels: Level 1 contains approved drugs separated into two groups; Level 1A contains approved drugs with variant specific information while Level 1B contains approved drugs with gene level information. Level 2 contains drugs currently in oncology clinical trials. Level 3 provides pharmacogenetic associations between approved drugs and genes.; CONCLUSION: IMPACT Web Portal allows for sequencing data to be linked to actionable therapeutics for translational and drug repurposing research. The IMPACT Web Portal online resource allows users to query genes and variants to approved and investigational drugs. We envision that this resource will be a valuable database for personalized medicine and drug repurposing. IMPACT Web Portal is freely available for non-commercial use at http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/IMPACT .

AB INTRODUCTION: Genome sequencing, a novel genetic diagnostic technology that analyses the billions of base pairs of DNA, promises to optimise healthcare through personalised diagnosis and treatment. However, implementation of genome sequencing faces challenges including the lack of consensus on disclosure of incidental results, gene changes unrelated to the disease under investigation, but of potential clinical significance to the patient and their provider. Current recommendations encourage clinicians to return medically actionable incidental results and stress the importance of education and informed consent. Given the shortage of genetics professionals and genomics expertise among healthcare providers, decision aids (DAs) can help fill a critical gap in the clinical delivery of genome sequencing. We aim to assess the effectiveness of an interactive DA developed for selection of incidental results.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will compare the DA in combination with a brief Q&A session with a genetic counsellor to genetic counselling alone in a mixed-methods randomised controlled trial. Patients who received negative standard cancer genetic results for their personal and family history of cancer and are thus eligible for sequencing will be recruited from cancer genetics clinics in Toronto. Our primary outcome is decisional conflict. Secondary outcomes are knowledge, satisfaction, preparation for decision-making, anxiety and length of session with the genetic counsellor. A subset of participants will complete a qualitative interview about preferences for incidental results.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by research ethics boards of St. Michael's Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. This research poses no significant risk to participants. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a novel patient-centred tool to support clinical delivery of incidental results. Results will be shared through national and international conferences, and at a stakeholder workshop to develop a consensus statement to optimise implementation of the DA in practice.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03244202; Pre-results. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains an incurable brain tumor. The highly malignant behavior of GBM may, in part, be attributed to its intraclonal genetic and phenotypic diversity (subclonal evolution). Identifying the molecular pathways driving GBM relapse may provide novel, actionable targets for personalized diagnosis, characterization of prognosis and improvement of precision therapy. We screened single-cell transcriptomes, namely RNA-seq data of primary and relapsed GBM tumors from a patient, to define the molecular profile of relapse. Characterization of hundreds of individual tumor cells identified three mutated genes within single cells, involved in the RAS/GEF GTP-dependent signaling pathway. The identified molecular pathway was further verified by meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from more than 3000 patients. This study showed that single-cell molecular analysis overcomes the inherent heterogeneity of bulk tumors with respect to defining tumor subclonal evolution relevant to GBM relapse.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent lymphoma genome sequencing projects have shed light on the genomic landscape of indolent and aggressive lymphomas, as well as some of the molecular mechanisms underlying recurrent mutations and translocations in these entities. Here, we review these recent genomic discoveries, focusing on acquired DNA repair defects in lymphoma. In addition, we highlight recently identified actionable molecular vulnerabilities associated with recurrent mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which serves as a model entity.; RECENT FINDINGS: The results of several large lymphoma genome sequencing projects have recently been reported, including CLL, T-PLL and DLBCL. We align these discoveries with proposed mechanisms of mutation acquisition in B-cell lymphomas. Moreover, novel autochthonous mouse models of CLL have recently been generated and we discuss how these models serve as preclinical tools to drive the development of novel targeted therapeutic interventions. Lastly, we highlight the results of early clinical data on novel compounds targeting defects in the DNA damage response of CLL with a particular focus on deleterious ATM mutations.; SUMMARY: Defects in DNA repair pathways are selected events in cancer, including lymphomas. Specifically, ATM deficiency is associated with PARP1- and DNA-PKcs inhibitor sensitivity in vitro and in vivo.

AB PURPOSE: In a diagnostic exome sequencing study (the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-Generation Exome Sequencing project, NCGENES), we investigated adult patients' intentions to request six categories of secondary findings (SFs) with low or no medical actionability and correlates of their intentions.; METHODS: At enrollment, eligible participants (n=152) completed measures assessing their sociodemographic, clinical, and literacy-related characteristics. Prior to and during an in-person diagnostic result disclosure visit, they received education about categories of SFs they could request. Immediately after receiving education at the visit, participants completed measures of intention to learn SFs, interest in each category, and anticipated regret for learning and not learning each category.; RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of participants intended to learn at least some SFs. Logistic regressions examined their intention to learn any or all of these findings (versus none) and interest in each of the six individual categories (yes/no). Results revealed little association between intentions and sociodemographic, clinical, or literacy-related factors. Across outcomes, participants who anticipated regret for learning SFs reported weaker intention to learn them (odds ratios (ORs) from 0.47 to 0.71), and participants who anticipated regret for not learning these findings reported stronger intention to learn them (OR 1.61-2.22).; CONCLUSION: Intentions to request SFs with low or no medical actionability may be strongly influenced by participants' desire to avoid regret.

AB BACKGROUND: The spread of substandard and falsified (SF) medical products constitutes a growing global public health concern. Some countries use portable, handheld screening technologies (STs) in the field to accelerate detection of SF medicines and reduce the number of medicine samples that undergo costly and time-consuming confirmatory analysis.; METHODS: A multi-country, multi-stakeholder landscape assessment utilizing qualitative methodology was used to examine practices and perceptions related to the use of STs. Qualitative interview guides were designed using the results of a literature review and comprised of open-ended questions with the study participants, who were from national medicine regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacies, and distributors. Ten geographically and economically diverse countries were selected: Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, the United States, and Zimbabwe. Of the completed 53 interviews, 32 were in-person, 16 were phone interviews, and 5 were via written questionnaires.; RESULTS: Data analysis shows a wide variation in understanding and usage of STs in different sectors. Virtually all of the study participants indicated a lack of objective, accessible information on STs to advise them on what technologies would be beneficial for their needs. Study participants also described their ideal capabilities of the next generation of STs, including shareable spectral libraries, lower acquisition costs, lesser training requirements, and in-country maintenance and technical support.; CONCLUSION: The results and recommendations presented in this article can be used to help regulators communicate and justify their needs to acquire and invest in new STs. There is a need for additional standardized, trustworthy and scientifically sound evaluations of STs, and to support regulators to effectively deploy the most promising technologies. ST manufacturers can take into account some of the limitations of the technologies the interviewees identified in this article, such as a dearth of technologies, which provide quantitative information about the active ingredient, and take steps to address them to better serve their customers. These results and recommendations, can catalyze research and actionable interventions into the development, review, application, and use of STs.

AB Delirium is a multifactorial entity, and its understanding continues to evolve. Delirium has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and cost for hospitalized patients, especially for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Recent literature on delirium focuses on specific pharmacologic risk factors and pharmacologic interventions to minimize course and severity of delirium. While medication management clearly plays a role in delirium management, there are a variety of nonpharmacologic interventions, pharmacologic minimization strategies, and protocols that have been recently described. A PubMed search was performed to review the evidence for nonpharmacologic management, pharmacologic minimization strategies, and prevention of delirium for patients in the ICU. Recent approaches were condensed into 10 actionable steps to manage delirium and minimize medications for ICU patients and are presented in this review.

AB Mobile technologies, such as wireless glucometers and mobile health apps, are increasingly being integrated into health and medical care. Because patients openly share real-time information about their health behaviors and outcomes on social media, social media data may also be used as a tool for monitoring patient care. This commentary describes how recent advances in computer science, psychology, and medicine enable social media data to become a new health "vital sign," as well as actionable steps that public health officials, health systems, and clinics can take to integrate social data into both public and population health as well as into individual patient care. Barriers that first need to be addressed, including privacy concerns, legal and ethical responsibilities, and infrastructure support, are discussed. ©Sean D Young.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has limited treatment options. Molecular analysis of its mutational landscape may enable the identification of novel therapies. However, biopsy is not routinely performed in HCC. The utility of analyzing cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is not established. We performed 32 ctDNA NGS analyses on 26 patients; 10 of these patients had tissue NGS (236 to 626 genes). ctDNA was evaluated using an assay that detects single nucleotide variants, amplifications, fusions, and specific insertion/deletion alterations in 54 to 70 genes. The ctDNA demonstrated that 23 of 26 patients (88.5%) had ≥1 characterized alteration, and all these individuals had ≥1 potentially actionable alteration. The most frequently mutated gene was TP53 (16 of 26 patients, 61.5%). There were 47 unique characterized molecular alterations among 18 total gene alterations [variants of unknown significance (VUS) excluded)]. ctDNA and tissue NGS frequently showed different profiles, perhaps due to length of time between tissue and blood samples [median = 370 days (range, 29 to 876 days)]. Serial ctDNA evaluation in an illustrative patient treated with capecitabine demonstrated emergence of a new TP53 alteration after progression. In conclusion, ctDNA profiling is feasible in advanced HCC, and serial assessment using ctDNA NGS can reveal genomic changes with time. NGS of ctDNA provides a minimally invasive alternative for identifying potentially actionable gene alterations and potential molecular targeted therapies. Dynamic changes in molecular portfolio associated with therapeutic pressure in difficult-to-biopsy patients can be observed.

AB Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) of cancer tissues is increasingly being carried out to identify somatic genomic alterations that may guide physicians to make therapeutic decisions. However, a single tissue biopsy may not reflect complete genomic architecture due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis is a robust noninvasive method to detect and monitor genomic alterations in blood in real time. We analyzed 28 matched tissue NGS and ctDNA from gastrointestinal and lung cancers for concordance of somatic genomic alterations, driver, and actionable alterations. Six patients (21%) had at least one concordant mutation between tissue and ctDNA sequencing. At the gene level, among all the mutations (n = 104) detected by tissue and blood sequencing, 7.7% (n = 8) of mutations were concordant. Tissue and ctDNA sequencing identified driver mutations in 60% and 64% of the tested samples, respectively. We found high discordance between tissue and ctDNA testing, especially with respect to the driver and actionable alterations. Both tissue and ctDNA NGS detected actionable alterations in 25% of patients. When somatic alterations identified by each test were combined, the total number of patients with actionable mutations increased to 32%. Our data show significant discordance between tissue NGS and ctDNA analysis. These results suggest tissue NGS and ctDNA NGS are complementary approaches rather than exclusive of each other. When performed in isolation, tissue and ctDNA NGS can each potentially miss driver and targetable alterations, suggesting that both approaches should be incorporated to enhance mutation detection rates. Larger prospective studies are needed to better clarify this emerging precision oncology landscape. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(5); 1123-32. ©2018 AACR. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease that is further classified into transcriptionally defined activated B cell (ABC) and germinal center B cell (GCB) subtypes. We carried out a comprehensive genetic analysis of 304 primary DLBCLs and identified low-frequency alterations, captured recurrent mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants, and defined coordinate signatures in patients with available outcome data. We integrated these genetic drivers using consensus clustering and identified five robust DLBCL subsets, including a previously unrecognized group of low-risk ABC-DLBCLs of extrafollicular/marginal zone origin; two distinct subsets of GCB-DLBCLs with different outcomes and targetable alterations; and an ABC/GCB-independent group with biallelic inactivation of TP53, CDKN2A loss, and associated genomic instability. The genetic features of the newly characterized subsets, their mutational signatures, and the temporal ordering of identified alterations provide new insights into DLBCL pathogenesis. The coordinate genetic signatures also predict outcome independent of the clinical International Prognostic Index and suggest new combination treatment strategies. More broadly, our results provide a roadmap for an actionable DLBCL classification.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of surveillance after therapy of localized esophageal cancer (LEC) is to identify actionable relapses amenable to salvage; however, the current surveillance algorithms are not optimized. We report on a large cohort of LEC patients with actionable locoregional relapses (LRRs).; METHODS: Between 2000 and 2013, 127 (denominator = 752) patients with actionable LRR were identified. Histologic/cytologic confirmation was the gold standard. All surveillance tools (imaging, endoscopy, fine needle aspiration) were assessed.; RESULTS: Most patients were men (89%), had adenocarcinoma (79%), and had no new symptoms (72%) when diagnosed with LRR. In trimodality patients, endoscopic confirmation of positron emission tomography-computed tomography-suspected LRR occurred in only 44%, and 56% required additional tools (e.g., fine needle aspiration). Alternatively, in bimodality patients, endoscopy confirmed LRRs in 81%. Trimodality patients had a higher risk of subsequent LRR/distant metastases after the first LRR than the bimodality patients (p = 0.03). In all patients, 78% of the subsequent relapses were distant. For patients who were salvaged, survival was significantly prolonged (50.6 vs. 25.1 months, p < 0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: Patients live longer after successful salvage of the LRR than if salvage is not possible. After LRR, patients have a high risk of subsequent distant metastasis and whether the second relapse is local or distant, survival is uniformly poor. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the radiation risk to a child undergoing trauma evaluation with chest computed tomography (CCT) for every clinically actionable injury identified.; STUDY DESIGN: This observational, cross-sectional study included all blunt trauma patients under 18 years of age undergoing CCT in a single urban emergency department. Via a retrospective chart review, therapeutic interventions done exclusively for chest injuries identified on CCT scan were identified. Effective radiation from each CCT was calculated and averaged and the dose required to diagnose 1 management-changing chest injury was determined.; RESULTS: Of 209 children undergoing CCT over a 19-month period, 168 were victims of blunt trauma. Ten required an intervention specifically for a chest injury identified on CCT (suggesting development of 1 malignancy per 37 actionable injures identified). None required an intervention for an injury exclusively noted on CCT, as all 10 actionable injuries were apparent via other modalities (radiograph, ultrasound examination, clinical examination).; CONCLUSION: Although 10 uniquely actionable injuries were identified on CCT, none were found only on CCT. Because CCTs rarely modified management, the amount of radiation administered per management change was sufficiently high to recommend reconsideration of current imaging practice in this single-center study.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify the elements necessary for successful collaboration between patient groups and academic and industry sponsors of clinical trials, in order to develop recommendations for best practices for effective patient group engagement.; METHODS: In-depth interviews, informed by a previously reported survey, were conducted to identify the fundamentals of successful patient group engagement. Thirty-two respondents from 3 sectors participated: patient groups, academic researchers, and industry. The findings were presented to a multistakeholder group of experts in January 2015. The expert group came to consensus on a set of actionable recommendations for best practices for patient groups and research sponsors.; RESULTS: Interview respondents acknowledged that not all patient groups are created equal in terms of what they can contribute to a clinical trial. The most important elements for effective patient group engagement include establishing meaningful partnerships, demonstrating mutual benefits, and collaborating as partners from the planning stage forward. Although there is a growing appreciation by sponsors about the benefits of patient group engagement, there remains some resistance and some uncertainty about how best to engage. Barriers include mismatched expectations and a perception that patient groups lack scientific sophistication and that "wishful thinking" may cloud their recommendations.; CONCLUSIONS: Patient groups are developing diverse skillsets and acquiring assets to leverage in order to become collaborators with industry and academia on clinical trials. Growing numbers of research sponsors across the clinical trials enterprise are recognizing the benefits of continuous and meaningful patient group engagement, but there are still mindsets to change, and stakeholders need further guidance on operationalizing a new model of clinical trial conduct.

AB BACKGROUND: Global health care manufacturer Novo Nordisk commissioned research regarding awareness of drug safety department activities and potential to increase patient feedback. Objectives were to examine patients' knowledge of pharmaceutical manufacturers' responsibilities and efforts regarding drug safety, their perceptions and experiences related to these efforts, and how these factors influence their thoughts and behaviors. Data were collected before and after respondents read a description of a drug safety department and its practices.; METHODS: We conducted quantitative survey research across 608 health care consumers receiving treatment for diabetes in the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and Italy. This research validated initial, exploratory qualitative research (across 40 comparable consumers from the same countries) which served to guide design of the larger study.; RESULTS: Before reading a drug safety department description, 55% of respondents were unaware these departments collect safety information on products and patients. After reading the description, 34% reported the department does more than they expected to ensure drug safety, and 56% reported "more confidence" in the industry as a whole. Further, 66% reported themselves more likely to report an adverse event or product complaint, and 60% reported that they were more likely to contact a drug safety department with questions. The most preferred communication methods were websites/online forums (39%), email (27%), and telephone (25%).; CONCLUSIONS: Learning about drug safety departments elevates consumers' confidence in manufacturers' safety efforts and establishes potential for patients to engage in increased self-monitoring and reporting. Study results reveal potentially actionable insights for the industry across patient and physician programs and communications.

AB Despite increased awareness and recognition of the prevalence of physician burnout and the associated risks of depression and suicide, there is a paucity of actionable guidelines for residency programs to mitigate these risks for their residents. In this Invited Commentary, the authors acknowledge that, although there are inherent barriers to resident wellness, there are numerous modifiable barriers that present opportunities for programs to enable culture change and improve resident well-being. The authors frame the discussion with a personal narrative written by a resident in their internal medicine program who experienced burnout, depression, and suicidality during his intern year. They aim to inspire residency programs and hospital leadership to identify and intervene upon the modifiable barriers to wellness for residents in their programs in order to shape meaningful cultural change.

AB OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the morphologic features and clinical characteristics of lung adenocarcinomas (ACAs) harboring mutated BRAF.; STUDY DESIGN: A review of the histology/cytology of BRAF-mutated lung ACAs was performed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2015. Patient demographics, clinical history, and ACA morphology were assessed.; RESULTS: Thirty-six cases were identified with a median age of 66 years (range 44-87), 58% (21/36) were female, and 94% (34/36) were current or former smokers. In total, 28% (10/36) had a BRAF-V600E mutation. Concurrent mutations were identified in KRAS in 4 cases (11%), PIK3CA in 2 cases (6%), and AKT1 in 2 cases (6%). No cases tested for ALK rearrangement were positive. The tumor grading varied from well to poorly differentiated, and the architecture assumed various patterns, including papillary, micropapillary, solid/cribriform, lepidic, and acinar. Of the cases with immunostains, 90% (18/20) were TTF-1 positive, 88% (14/16) were napsin-A positive, and 100% (8/8) were P63 negative.; CONCLUSION: Mutated-BRAF lung ACA arose on average in the seventh decade of life in patients who were current or former smokers and was infrequently found in combination with other common lung ACA driver mutations. The actionable V600E mutation was present in <30% of cases, more commonly in females. The histologic grade and architecture of these tumors varied significantly. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Vascular access outcomes in hemodialysis are critically important for patients and clinicians, but frequently are neither patient relevant nor measured consistently in randomized trials. A Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Hemodialysis (SONG-HD) consensus workshop was convened to discuss the development of a core outcome measure for vascular access. 13 patients/caregivers and 46 professionals (clinicians, policy makers, industry representatives, and researchers) attended. Participants advocated for vascular access function to be a core outcome based on the broad applicability of function regardless of access type, involvement of a multidisciplinary team in achieving a functioning access, and the impact of access function on quality of life, survival, and other access-related outcomes. A core outcome measure for vascular access required demonstrable feasibility for implementation across different clinical and trial settings. Participants advocated for a practical and flexible outcome measure with a simple actionable definition. Integrating patients' values and preferences was warranted to enhance the relevance of the measure. Proposed outcome measures for function included "uninterrupted use of the access without the need for interventions" and "ability to receive prescribed dialysis," but not "access blood flow," which was deemed too expensive and unreliable. These recommendations will inform the definition and implementation of a core outcome measure for vascular access function in hemodialysis trials. Copyright © 2018 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB Diversity in the genetic lesions that cause cancer is extreme. In consequence, a pressing challenge is the development of drugs that target patient-specific disease mechanisms. To address this challenge, we employed a chemistry-first discovery paradigm for de novo identification of druggable targets linked to robust patient selection hypotheses. In particular, a 200,000 compound diversity-oriented chemical library was profiled across a heavily annotated test-bed of >100 cellular models representative of the diverse and characteristic somatic lesions for lung cancer. This approach led to the delineation of 171 chemical-genetic associations, shedding light on the targetability of mechanistic vulnerabilities corresponding to a range of oncogenotypes present in patient populations lacking effective therapy. Chemically addressable addictions to ciliogenesis in TTC21B mutants and GLUT8-dependent serine biosynthesis in KRAS/KEAP1 double mutants are prominent examples. These observations indicate a wealth of actionable opportunities within the complex molecular etiology of cancer. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To analytically and clinically validate a circulating cell-free tumor DNA sequencing test for comprehensive tumor genotyping and demonstrate its clinical feasibility.Experimental Design: Analytic validation was conducted according to established principles and guidelines. Blood-to-blood clinical validation comprised blinded external comparison with clinical droplet digital PCR across 222 consecutive biomarker-positive clinical samples. Blood-to-tissue clinical validation comprised comparison of digital sequencing calls to those documented in the medical record of 543 consecutive lung cancer patients. Clinical experience was reported from 10,593 consecutive clinical samples.Results: Digital sequencing technology enabled variant detection down to 0.02% to 0.04% allelic fraction/2.12 copies with ≤0.3%/2.24-2.76 copies 95% limits of detection while maintaining high specificity [prevalence-adjusted positive predictive values (PPV) >98%]. Clinical validation using orthogonal plasma- and tissue-based clinical genotyping across >750 patients demonstrated high accuracy and specificity [positive percent agreement (PPAs) and negative percent agreement (NPAs) >99% and PPVs 92%-100%]. Clinical use in 10,593 advanced adult solid tumor patients demonstrated high feasibility (>99.6% technical success rate) and clinical sensitivity (85.9%), with high potential actionability (16.7% with FDA-approved on-label treatment options; 72.0% with treatment or trial recommendations), particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where 34.5% of patient samples comprised a directly targetable standard-of-care biomarker.Conclusions: High concordance with orthogonal clinical plasma- and tissue-based genotyping methods supports the clinical accuracy of digital sequencing across all four types of targetable genomic alterations. Digital sequencing's clinical applicability is further supported by high rates of technical success and biomarker target discovery.

AB The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), at www.iedb.org, has the mission to make published experimental data relating to the recognition of immune epitopes easily available to the scientific public. By presenting curated data in a searchable database, we have liberated it from the tables and figures of journal articles, making it more accessible and usable by immunologists. Recently, the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability have been formulated as goals that data repositories should meet to enhance the usefulness of their data holdings. We here examine how the IEDB complies with these principles and identify broad areas of success, but also areas for improvement. We describe short-term improvements to the IEDB that are being implemented now, as well as a long-term vision of true 'machine-actionable interoperability', which we believe will require community agreement on standardization of knowledge representation that can be built on top of the shared use of ontologies.

AB OBJECTIVE: Focusing health interventions in places with suboptimal glycemic control can help direct resources to neighborhoods with poor diabetes-related outcomes, but finding these areas can be difficult. Our objective was to use indirect measures versus a gold standard, population-based A1C registry to identify areas of poor glycemic control.; RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Census tracts in New York City (NYC) were characterized by race, ethnicity, income, poverty, education, diabetes-related emergency visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and proportion of adults with diabetes having poor glycemic control, based on A1C >9.0% (75 mmol/mol). Hot spot analyses were then performed, using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for all measures. We then calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of using the indirect measures to identify hot spots of poor glycemic control found using the NYC A1C Registry data.; RESULTS: Using A1C Registry data, we identified hot spots in 42.8% of 2,085 NYC census tracts analyzed. Hot spots of diabetes-specific inpatient hospitalizations, diabetes-specific emergency visits, and age-adjusted diabetes prevalence estimated from emergency department data, respectively, had 88.9%, 89.6%, and 89.5% accuracy for identifying the same hot spots of poor glycemic control found using A1C Registry data. No other indirect measure tested had accuracy >80% except for the proportion of minority residents, which had 86.2% accuracy.; CONCLUSIONS: Compared with demographic and socioeconomic factors, health care utilization measures more accurately identified hot spots of poor glycemic control. In places without a population-based A1C registry, mapping diabetes-specific health care utilization may provide actionable evidence for targeting health interventions in areas with the highest burden of uncontrolled diabetes. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB The AML1-ETO fusion protein (A/E), which results from the t(8;21) translocation, is considered to be a leukemia-initiating event. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic activity of A/E remains a major challenge. In this study, we identified a specific down-regulation of brain acid-soluble protein 1 (BASP1) in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A/E recognized AML1-binding sites and recruited DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) to the BASP1 promoter sequence, which triggered DNA methylation-mediated silencing of BASP1. Ectopic expression of BASP1 inhibited proliferation and the colony-forming ability of A/E-positive AML cell lines and led to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The DNMT inhibitor decitabine up-regulated the expression of BASP1 in A/E-positive AML cell lines. In conclusion, our data suggest that BASP1 silencing via promoter methylation may be involved in A/E-mediated leukemogenesis and that BASP1 targeting may be an actionable therapeutic strategy in t(8;21) AML.

AB OBJECTIVE: Extra-pulmonary small cell carcinomas of the gynecologic tract (EPSCC-GTs) are a rare group of aggressive malignancies associated with poor prognoses and limited treatment options. Here, we review the clinical and molecular aspects of EPSCC-GTs and discuss how understanding their molecular features can assist in their diagnosis and the identification of novel effective treatments.; METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus for articles using the following keywords: "small cell carcinoma" in combination with "neuroendocrine", "ovary", "vagina", "fallopian tube", "vulva", "endometrium", "uterus", "cervix", or "gynecologic". Articles were limited to those published in English from January 1984 to October 2017.; RESULTS: EPSCC-GTs account for 2% of all gynecologic malignancies. The molecular features of EPSCC-GTs are largely understudied and unknown, with the exception of small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and SCC of the cervix (SCCC). In nearly all cases, SCCOHT displays mutation in a single gene, SMARCA4, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The loss of expression of the SWI/SNF protein SMARCA2 is another feature of SCCOHT. Dual negative staining for SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 is specific for SCCOHT and is generally used by gynecologic pathologists for the accurate diagnosis of this malignancy. Mutational analysis of SCCC has shown alterations in PIK3CA, KRAS and TP53, of which the last is the most common, although other actionable mutations have been identified. The molecular features of other EPSCC-GTs are largely unknown.; CONCLUSIONS: Due to their rarity, the majority of EPSCC-GTs are understudied and poorly understood. As demonstrated in the case of SCCOHT, unraveling the mutational profiles of these tumors can lead to improved diagnosis and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

AB Urachal cancer (UrC) is a rare but aggressive malignancy often diagnosed in advanced stages requiring systemic treatment. Although cytotoxic chemotherapy is of limited effectiveness, prospective clinical studies can hardly be conducted. Targeted therapeutic treatment approaches and potentially immunotherapy based on a biological rationale may provide an alternative strategy. We therefore subjected 70 urachal adenocarcinomas to targeted next-generation sequencing, conducted in situ and immunohistochemical analyses (including PD-L1 and DNA mismatch repair proteins [MMR]) and evaluated the microsatellite instability (MSI) status. The analytical findings were correlated with clinicopathological and outcome data and Kaplan-Meier and univariable/multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed. The patients had a mean age of 50 years, 66% were male and a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 58% and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 45% was detected. Sequence variations were observed in TP53 (66%), KRAS (21%), BRAF (4%), PIK3CA (4%), FGFR1 (1%), MET (1%), NRAS (1%), and PDGFRA (1%). Gene amplifications were found in EGFR (5%), ERBB2 (2%), and MET (2%). We detected no evidence of MMR-deficiency (MMR-d)/MSI-high (MSI-h), whereas 10 of 63 cases (16%) expressed PD-L1. Therefore, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy approaches might be tested in UrC. Importantly, we found aberrations in intracellular signal transduction pathways (RAS/RAF/PI3K) in 31% of UrCs with potential implications for anti-EGFR therapy. Less frequent potentially actionable genetic alterations were additionally detected in ERBB2 (HER2), MET, FGFR1, and PDGFRA. The molecular profile strengthens the notion that UrC is a distinct entity on the genomic level with closer resemblance to colorectal than to bladder cancer. © 2018 UICC.

AB We utilized a participatory mapping approach to collect point locations, photographs, and descriptive data about select built environment stressors identified and prioritized by community residents living in the Proctor Creek Watershed, a degraded, urban watershed in Northwest Atlanta, Georgia. Residents (watershed researchers) used an indicator identification framework to select three watershed stressors that influence urban livability: standing water, illegal dumping on land and in surface water, and faulty stormwater infrastructure. Through a community⁻university partnership and using Geographic Information Systems and digital mapping tools, watershed researchers and university students designed a mobile application (app) that enabled them to collect data associated with these stressors to create a spatial narrative, informed by local community knowledge, that offers visual documentation and representation of community conditions that negatively influence the environment, health, and quality of life in urban areas. By elevating the local knowledge and lived experience of community residents and codeveloping a relevant data collection tool, community residents generated fine-grained, street-level, actionable data. This process helped to fill gaps in publicly available datasets about environmental hazards in their watershed and helped residents initiate solution-oriented dialogue with government officials to address problem areas. We demonstrate that community-based knowledge can contribute to and extend scientific inquiry, as well as help communities to advance environmental justice and leverage opportunities for remediation and policy change.

AB OBJECTIVES: Extant evidence indicates that ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressive (TRD) symptoms as a part of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The identification of depressed sub-populations that are more likely to benefit from ketamine treatment remains a priority. In keeping with this view, the present narrative review aims to identify the pretreatment predictors of response to ketamine in TRD as part of MDD and BD.; METHOD: Electronic search engines PubMed/MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus were searched for relevant articles from inception to January 2018. The search term ketamine was cross-referenced with the terms depression, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, predictors, and response and/or remission.; RESULTS: Multiple baseline pretreatment predictors of response were identified, including clinical (i.e., Body Mass Index (BMI), history of suicide, family history of alcohol use disorder), peripheral biochemistry (i.e., adiponectin levels, vitamin B12 levels), polysomnography (abnormalities in delta sleep ratio), neurochemistry (i.e., glutamine/glutamate ratio), neuroimaging (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex activity), genetic variation (i.e., Val66Met BDNF allele), and cognitive functioning (i.e., processing speed). High BMI and a positive family history of alcohol use disorder were the most replicated predictors.; CONCLUSIONS: A pheno-biotype of depression more, or less likely, to benefit with ketamine treatment is far from complete. Notwithstanding, metabolic-inflammatory alterations are emerging as possible pretreatment response predictors of depressive symptom improvement, most notably being cognitive impairment. Sophisticated data-driven computational methods that are iterative and agnostic are more likely to provide actionable baseline pretreatment predictive information.

AB INTRODUCTION: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130 million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises.; OBJECTIVE: Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media.; METHODOLOGY: We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis.; RESULTS: Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common.; CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common cancer of bone in children and young adults. Despite extensive research efforts, there has been no significant improvement in patient outcome for many years. An improved understanding of the biology of this cancer and how genes frequently mutated contribute to OS may help improve outcomes for patients. While our knowledge of the mutational burden of OS is approaching saturation, our understanding of how these mutations contribute to OS initiation and maintenance is less clear. Murine models of OS have now been demonstrated to be highly valid recapitulations of human OS. These models were originally based on the frequent disruption of p53 and Rb in familial OS syndromes, which are also common mutations in sporadic OS. They have been applied to significantly improve our understanding about the functions of recurrently mutated genes in disease. The murine models can be used as a platform for preclinical testing and identifying new therapeutic targets, in addition to testing the role of additional mutations in vivo. Most recently these models have begun to be used for discovery based approaches and screens, which hold significant promise in furthering our understanding of the genetic and therapeutic sensitivities of OS. In this review, we discuss the mouse models of OS that have been reported in the last 3-5 years and newly identified pathways from these studies. Finally, we discuss the preclinical utilization of the mouse models of OS for identifying and validating actionable targets to improve patient outcome. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients are frequently discharged from the hospital before all test results have been finalized. Thirty to 40% of tests pending at discharge (TPADs) return potentially actionable results that could necessitate change in the patients' management, often unbeknownst to their physicians. Delayed follow-up of TPADs can lead to patient harm. We sought to synthesize the existing literature on interventions intended to improve the management of TPADs, including interventions designed to enhance documentation of TPADs, increase physician awareness when TPAD results finalize post-discharge, decrease adverse events related to missed TPADs, and increase physician satisfaction with TPAD management.; METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Controlled Clinical Trials and Medline (January 1, 2000-November 10, 2016) for randomized controlled trials and prospective, controlled observational studies that evaluated interventions to improve follow-up of TPADs for adult patients discharged from acute care hospitals or emergency department settings. From each study we extracted characteristics of the intervention being evaluated and its impact on TPAD management.; RESULTS: Nine studies met the criteria for inclusion. Six studies evaluated electronic discharge summary templates with a designated field for documenting TPADs, and three of six of these studies reported a significant improvement in documentation of TPADs in discharge summaries in pre- and post-intervention analysis. One study reported that auditing discharge summaries and providing feedback to physicians were associated with improved TPAD documentation in discharge summaries. Two studies found that email alerts when TPADs were finalized improved physicians' awareness of the results and documentation of their follow-up actions. Of the four studies that assessed patient morbidity, two showed a positive effect; however, none specifically measured the impact of their interventions on downstream patient harm due to delayed follow-up of TPADs. Three studies surveyed physicians' attitudes towards the interventions, of which two studies reported improved physician satisfaction with TPAD management with the implementation of an enhanced discharge template and a notification system when TPADs finalize.; DISCUSSION: Discharge summary templates, educational interventions for discharging physicians, and email alerts when TPAD results are finalized show promise in improving management of TPADs. Given the complexity of the processes necessary to ensure follow-up of TPADs, rigorous evaluations of multifaceted interventions (e.g., improved discharge documentation of TPADs combined with email alerts when results become available) is needed.

AB Patients with heritable cancer syndromes characterized by germline PTEN mutations (termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, PHTS) benefit from PTEN-enabled cancer risk assessment and clinical management. PTEN-wildtype patients (~50%) remain at increased risk of developing certain cancers. Existence of germline mutations in other known cancer susceptibility genes has not been explored in these patients, with implications for different medical management. We conducted a 4-year multicenter prospective study of incident patients with features of Cowden/Cowden-like (CS/CS-like) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes (BRRS) without PTEN mutations. Exome sequencing and targeted analysis were performed including 59 clinically actionable genes from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and 24 additional genes associated with inherited cancer syndromes. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic cancer susceptibility gene alterations were found in 7 of the 87 (8%) CS/CS-like and BRRS patients and included MUTYH, RET, TSC2, BRCA1, BRCA2, ERCC2 and HRAS. We found classic phenotypes associated with the identified genes in 5 of the 7 (71.4%) patients. Variant positive patients were enriched for the presence of second malignant neoplasms compared to patients without identified variants (OR = 6.101, 95% CI 1.143-35.98, p = 0.035). Germline variant spectrum and frequencies were compared to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including 6 apparently sporadic cancers associated with PHTS. With comparable overall prevalence of germline variants, the spectrum of mutated genes was different in our patients compared to TCGA. Intriguingly, we also found notable enrichment of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in our patients (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.5, p = 0.0002). Our data suggest that only a small subset of PTEN-wildtype CS/CS-like and BRRS patients could be accounted for by germline variants in some of the known cancer-related genes. Thus, the existence of alterations in other and more likely non-classic cancer-associated genes is plausible, reflecting the complexity of these heterogeneous hereditary cancer syndromes.

AB The main objective of this project was to introduce approaches for comprehensive medication risk assessment in people with polypharmacy that simultaneously account for multiple drug and gene effects. To achieve this goal, we developed an integrated knowledge repository of actionable pharmacogenes and a scoring algorithm that was pilot-tested using a data set containing pharmacogenomic information of people with polypharmacy. Metabolic phenotyping using resulting database demonstrated recall of 83.6% and precision of 87.1%. The final scoring algorithm yielded medication risk scores that allowed distinguish frequently hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy and older adults with polypharmacy with low hospitalization rate (average scores respectively: 75.89±15.45 and 10.51±1.82, p&lt;0.05). The initial prototype assessment demonstrated feasibility of our approach and identified steps for improving risk scoring algorithms. Pharmacogenomics-driven medication risk assessment in patient with polypharmacy has potential in identifying inadequate drug regimens and preventing adverse drug events.

AB OBJECTIVES: To provide actionable recommendations for improving care coordination programs for children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN) in Medicaid managed care.; STUDY DESIGN: Literature review and interviews with stakeholders and policy experts to adapt lessons learned from Medicare care coordination programs for CSHCN in Medicaid managed care.; METHODS: We reviewed syntheses of research on Medicare care coordination programs to identify lessons learned from successful programs. We adapted findings from Medicare to CSHCN in Medicaid based on an environmental scan and discussions with experts. The scan focused on Medicaid financing and eligibility for care coordination and how these intersect with Medicaid managed care. The expert discussions included pediatricians, Medicaid policy experts, Medicaid medical directors, and a former managed care executive, all experienced in care coordination for CSHCN.; RESULTS: We found 6 elements that are consistently associated with improved outcomes from Medicare care coordination programs and relevant to CSHCN in Medicaid: 1) identifying and targeting high-risk patients, 2)clearly articulating what outcomes programs are likely to improve, 3) encouraging active engagement between care coordinators and primary care providers, 4) requiring some in-person contact between care coordinators and patients, 5) facilitating information sharing among providers, and 6) supplementing care coordinators' expertise with that of other clinical experts.; CONCLUSIONS: States and Medicaid managed care organizations have many options for designing effective care coordination programs for CSHCN. Their choices should account for the diversity of conditions among CSHCN, families' capacity to coordinate care, and social determinants of health.

AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging is frequently said to be "overused" in the evaluation of low back pain, yet data concerning the extent of overuse and the potential harmful effects are lacking.; PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of examinations with a detectable impact on patient care (actionable outcomes).; STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study.; PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 5,365 outpatient lumbar spine magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were conducted.; OUTCOME MEASURES: Actionable outcomes included (1) findings leading to an intervention making use of anatomical information such as surgery; (2) new diagnoses of cancer, infection, or fracture; or (3) following known lumbar spine pathology. Potential harm was assessed by identifying examinations where suspicion of cancer or infection was raised but no positive diagnosis made.; METHODS: A medical record aggregation/search system was used to identify lumbar spine MR examinations with positive outcome measures. Patient notes were examined to verify outcomes. A random sample was manually inspected to identify missed positive outcomes.; RESULTS: The proportion of actionable lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging was 13%, although 93% were appropriate according to the American College of Radiology guidelines. Of 36 suspected cases of cancer or infection, 81% were false positives. Further investigations were ordered on 59% of suspicious examinations, 86% of which were false positives.; CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of lumbar spine MR examinations that inform management is small. The false-positive rate and the proportion of false positives involving further investigation are high. Further study to improve the efficiency of imaging is warranted. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Tumours can be viewed as aberrant tissues or organs sustained by tumorigenic stem-like cells that engage into dysregulated histo/organogenetic processes. Paragangliomas, prototypical organoid tumours constituted by dysmorphic variants of the vascular and neural tissues found in normal paraganglia, provide a model to test this hypothesis. To understand the origin of paragangliomas, we built a biobank comprising 77 cases, 18 primary cultures, 4 derived cell lines, 80 patient-derived xenografts and 11 cell-derived xenografts. We comparatively investigated these unique complementary materials using morphofunctional, ultrastructural and flow cytometric assays accompanied by microRNA studies. We found that paragangliomas contain stem-like cells with hybrid mesenchymal/vasculoneural phenotype, stabilized and expanded in the derived cultures. The viability and growth of such cultures depended on the downregulation of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, which allowed high PDGFRA and ZEB1 protein expression levels. Both tumour tissue- and cell culture-derived xenografts recapitulated the vasculoneural paraganglioma structure and arose from mesenchymal-like cells through a fixed developmental sequence. First, vasculoangiogenesis organized the microenvironment, building a perivascular niche which in turn supported neurogenesis. Neuroepithelial differentiation was associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction, not present in cultured paraganglioma cells, but acquired in vivo during xenograft formation. Vasculogenesis was the Achilles' heel of xenograft development. In fact, imatinib, that targets endothelial-mural signalling, blocked paraganglioma xenograft formation (11 xenografts from 12 cell transplants in the control group versus 2 out of 10 in the treated group, P=0.0015). Overall our key results were unaffected by the SDHx gene carrier status of the patient, characterized for 70 out of 77 cases. In conclusion, we explain the biphasic vasculoneural structure of paragangliomas and identify an early and pharmacologically actionable phase of paraganglioma organization.

AB OBJECTIVES: We examined perceptions and behaviors associated with smoking susceptibility among adolescents in the current tobacco landscape.; METHODS: Participants were 8th and 10th grade never-smokers of conventional cigarettes (N = 19,853) from Monitoring the Future surveys (2014-2016). Using weighted multivariable logistic regression, we examined risk factors for smoking susceptibility: alternative tobacco product use (e-cigarettes, large cigars, little cigars/cigarillos, and flavored little cigars/cigarillos), ownership of tobacco promotional items (TPIs), access to cigarettes, perceived influence of antismoking advertisements, and perceived addictiveness of conventional cigarette smoking.; RESULTS: Among never-smokers of conventional cigarettes, 16.7% were susceptible to smoking, 6.2% were past 30-day alternative tobacco product users, and 3.5% owned TPIs. Alternative tobacco product use, ownership of TPIs, and easy access to cigarettes were associated with increased likelihood of smoking susceptibility. Perceived great influence by antismoking ads and higher perceived addictiveness of conventional cigarette smoking were associated with lower odds of smoking susceptibility.; CONCLUSION: Alternative tobacco product use, ownership of TPIs, easy access to cigarettes, low influence by antismoking ads, and low perceptions of the addictiveness of conventional cigarettes are significant and actionable risk factors for smoking susceptibility among today's adolescents.

AB Genetic testing is used for screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases consistent with a genetic cause and to guide drug therapy to improve drug efficacy and avoid adverse effects (pharmacogenomics). This In Practice review aims to inform about DNA-related genetic test availability, interpretation, and recommended clinical actions based on results using evidence from clinical guidelines, when available. We discuss challenges that limit the widespread use of genetic information in the clinical care setting, including a small number of actionable genetic variants with strong evidence of clinical validity and utility, and the need for improving the health literacy of health care providers and the public, including for direct-to-consumer tests. Ethical, legal, and social issues and incidental findings also need to be addressed. Because our understanding of genetic factors associated with disease and drug response is rapidly increasing and new genetic tests are being developed that could be adopted by clinicians in the short term, we also provide extensive resources for information and education on genetic testing.

AB Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an oncogenic driver, and a well-established therapeutic target in breast and gastric cancers. Using functional and genomic analyses of patient-derived xenografts, we previously showed that a subset (approximately 5%) of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors is driven by amplification or mutation of HER2. This paper reviews the role of HER2 amplification as an oncogenic driver, a prognostic and predictive biomarker, and a clinically actionable target in CRC, considering the specifics of HER2 testing in this tumor type. While the role of HER2 as a biomarker for prognosis in CRC remains uncertain, its relevance as a therapeutic target has been established. Indeed, independent studies documented substantial clinical benefit in patients treated with biomarker-driven HER2-targeted therapies, with an impact on response rates and duration of response that compared favorably with immunotherapy and other examples of precision oncology. HER2-targeted therapeutic strategies have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for a clinically relevant subgroup of metastatic CRC patients.

AB FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) mutations are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with poor patient prognosis. Although new-generation FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have shown promising results, the outcome of FLT3ITD AML patients remains poor and demands the identification of novel, specific, and validated therapeutic targets for this highly aggressive AML subtype. Utilizing an unbiased genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 screen, we identify GLS, the first enzyme in glutamine metabolism, as synthetically lethal with FLT3-TKI treatment. Using complementary metabolomic and gene-expression analysis, we demonstrate that glutamine metabolism, through its ability to support both mitochondrial function and cellular redox metabolism, becomes a metabolic dependency of FLT3ITD AML, specifically unmasked by FLT3-TKI treatment. We extend these findings to AML subtypes driven by other tyrosine kinase (TK) activating mutations and validate the role of GLS as a clinically actionable therapeutic target in both primary AML and in vivo models. Our work highlights the role of metabolic adaptations as a resistance mechanism to several TKI and suggests glutaminolysis as a therapeutically targetable vulnerability when combined with specific TKI in FLT3ITD and other TK activating mutation-driven leukemias. © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequent subtype of lymphoid malignancy, remains a significant clinical challenge, as 30% of patients are not cured. Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, spurred by the implementation of powerful genomic technologies that enabled the definition of its genetic and epigenetic landscape. These studies have uncovered a multitude of genomic alterations that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the tumor clone by disrupting biological functions known to be critical for the normal biology of its cells of origin, germinal center B cells. The identified alterations involve epigenetic remodeling, block of differentiation, escape from immune surveillance, and the constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. This wealth of new information offers unique opportunities for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic tools that could help guide the clinical management of DLBCL patients. Furthermore, a number of the mutated genes identified are potentially actionable targets that are currently being explored for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge of the most common genetic alterations associated with DLBCL in relation to their functional impact on the malignant transformation process, and discusses their clinical implications for mechanism-based therapeutics. © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been few studies that compared the effects of lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) and double-pigtail plastic stents (DPS) in patients with peripancreatic fluid collections from pancreatitis. We aimed to compare technical and clinical success and adverse events in patients who received LAMS vs DPS for pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off necrosis.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of endoscopic ultrasound-mediated drainage in 149 patients (65% male; mean age, 47 y) with pancreatic pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis (97received LAMS and 152 received DPS), from January 2011 through September 2016 at a single center. We collected data on patient characteristics, outcomes, hospitalizations, and imaging findings. Technical success was defined as LAMS insertion or a minimum of 2 DPS. Clinical success was defined as resolution of pancreatic pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis based on imaging results. The primary outcome was resolution of peripancreatic fluid collection with reduced abdominal pain or obstructive signs or symptoms. Secondary outcomes included the identification and management of adverse events, number of additional procedures required to resolve fluid collection, and the recurrence of fluid collection.; RESULTS: Patients who received LAMS had larger peripancreatic fluid collections than patients who received DPS prior to intervention (P= .001), and underwent an average 1.7 interventions vs 1.9 interventions for patients who received DPS (P= .93). Technical success was achieved for 90 patients with LAMS (92.8%) vs 137 patients with DPS (90.1%) (odds ratio [OR] for success with DPS, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.33-2.0; P= .67). Despite larger fluid collections in the LAMS group, there was no significant difference in proportions of patients with clinical success following placement of LAMS (82 of 84 patients, 97.6%) vs DPS (118 of 122 patients, 96.7%) (OR for clinical success with DPS, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.13-4.0; P= .71). Adverse events developed in 24 patients who received LAMS (24.7%) vs 27 patients who received DPS (17.8%) (OR for an adverse event in a patient receiving a DPS, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.33-2.0; P= .67). However, patients with LAMS had a higher risk of pseudoaneurysm bleeding than patients with DPS (OR, 10.0; 95% CI, 1.19-84.6; P= .009).; CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients undergoing drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis, we found LAMS and DPS to have comparable rates of technical and clinical success and adverse events. Drainage of walled-off necrosis or pancreatic pseudocysts using DPS was associated with fewer bleeding events overall, including pseudoaneurysm bleeding, but bleeding risk with LAMS should be weighed against the trend of higher actionable perforation and infection rates with DPS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a useful tool for gene mutation testing which is required for targeted therapies. The aim of this study was to validate the GeneRead QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel (Qiagen) on the GeneReader System in a diagnostic laboratory setting.; METHODS: The GeneRead QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel allows the analysis of 773 variant positions in 12 genes (ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ESR1, KIT, KRAS, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA and RAF1). For the validation of the panel we used a commercial available multiplex reference standard carrying 11 mutations in defined positions, samples from interlaboratory tests, and FFPE tumor samples from patients which were tested previously for mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, KIT, and/or PDGFRA with pyrosequencing.; RESULTS: Among the 122 tested samples, 121 samples (99.2%) were successfully sequenced. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting variants was 100% and results proved to be reproducible and precise. 119 (98.3%) results were concordant to the expected results. The differences between NGS and pyrosequencing observed in two samples were due to a wrong analysis by the pyrosequencing software which did not cover the present mutations.; CONCLUSION: Overall, the GeneRead QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel was specific and sensitive for mutation analysis for targeted therapies and can be incorporated into laboratory diagnostics' daily practice.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to determine whether monitoring of duodenoscope cleaning by rapid adenosine triphosphate (ATP) combined with channel-purge storage could eliminate high-concern microorganisms.; METHODS: In a simulated-use study, suction channels, as well as lever recesses, from 2 duodenoscopes models and the unsealed elevator guidewire (EGW) channel from 1 of these 2 duodenoscopes (the other model has a sealed EGW) were perfused with ATS2015 containing approximately 8 Log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Pump-assisted cleaning was monitored by rapid ATP testing. Duodenoscopes exceeding 200 relative light units (RLUs) were recleaned. Clean duodenoscopes were processed through an automated endoscope reprocessor and then stored in a channel-purge storage cabinet for 1 to 3 days. Cultures of EGW channel and instrument channel combined with the lever recess (IC-LR) were taken after storage. The impacts of extended cleaning and alcohol flush were evaluated.; RESULTS: E coli was reliably eliminated in IC-LR and EGW channels of 119 duodenoscope tests (59 with sealed EGW and 60 with nonsealed EGW). However, actionable levels of E faecalis and environmental bacteria persisted. Neither alcohol flush nor extended cleaning resulted in a reduction of actionable levels for these organisms. Identification of isolates indicated that residual organisms in duodenoscope channels were hardy Gram-positive bacteria (often spore formers) that likely originated from environmental sources.; CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that high-concern Gram-negative bacteria but not E faecalis or environmental bacteria can be reliably eliminated by use of the manufacturer's instructions for reprocessing with ATP monitoring of cleaning and channel-purge storage conditions.

AB Compared to RNA-sequencing transcript differential analysis, gene-level differential expression analysis is more robust and experimentally actionable. However, the use of gene counts for statistical analysis can mask transcript-level dynamics. We demonstrate that 'analysis first, aggregation second,' where the p values derived from transcript analysis are aggregated to obtain gene-level results, increase sensitivity and accuracy. The method we propose can also be applied to transcript compatibility counts obtained from pseudoalignment of reads, which circumvents the need for quantification and is fast, accurate, and model-free. The method generalizes to various levels of biology and we showcase an application to gene ontologies.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to engage children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a developmentally sensitive way to explore the children's subjective well-being. Explicitly, their life satisfaction, or what makes their life "really good." To date, little is known about the subjective life experience of children with ADHD or how incorporating children's views separate from the purview of adults and pathology might enhance our understanding or change our approach to evaluation and/or intervention.; DESIGN AND METHODS: A parallel convergent mixed-methods design was used to collect data from a convenience sample of children with ADHD (N=20) ages 7 to 11years old. This article focuses solely on the qualitative data obtained through semi-structured interviews using the art-based approach draw-and-tell conversation (DTC). The DTC data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. In addition, each parent (N=20) independently completed demographic and health-related forms to provide descriptive and contextual variables.; RESULTS: Three themes were discerned in the DTC analysis-activity, nature, and connections. Most children (90%) described engaging in some form of activity, often outdoors, and with others; though the focus of activity was varied. Nature was evidenced directly and indirectly in many of the children's (85%) stories. Over half (65%) of the children described some variation in relational connection across a continuum that contributed to, or detracted from, their sense of well-being/life satisfaction.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Children shared that doing things, outdoors, with others, [emphasis added] made their life "really good". Children's stories yielded insightful and actionable information that is relevant to each individual child/family, and to nursing assessment, intervention, and advocacy. These child-granted insights also extend our attention beyond pharmacological and behavioral focused interventions, to include the children's own innate health promoting interests that help to make their life really good. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of the study was to develop an outcome-based NeuroImaging Radiological Interpretation System (NIRIS) for patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) that would standardize the interpretation of noncontrast head computer tomography (CT) scans and consolidate imaging findings into ordinal severity categories that would inform specific patient management actions and that could be used as a clinical decision support tool. We retrospectively identified all patients transported to our emergency department by ambulance or helicopter for whom a trauma alert was triggered per established criteria and who underwent a noncontrast head CT because of suspicion of TBI, between November 2015 and April 2016. Two neuroradiologists reviewed the noncontrast head CTs and assessed the TBI imaging common data elements (CDEs), as defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Using descriptive statistics and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to identify imaging characteristics and associated thresholds that best distinguished among outcomes, we classified patients into five mutually exclusive categories: 0-discharge from the emergency department; 1-follow-up brain imaging and/or admission; 2-admission to an advanced care unit; 3-neurosurgical procedure; 4-death up to 6 months after TBI. Sensitivity of NIRIS with respect to each patient's true outcome was then evaluated and compared with that of the Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems for TBI. In our cohort of 542 patients with TBI, NIRIS was developed to predict discharge (182 patients), follow-up brain imaging/admission (187 patients), need for advanced care unit (151 patients), neurosurgical procedures (10 patients), and death (12 patients). NIRIS performed similarly to the Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems in terms of predicting death. We developed an interpretation system for neuroimaging using the CDEs that informs specific patient management actions and could be used as a clinical decision support tool for patients with TBI. Our NIRIS classification, with evidence-based grouping of the CDEs into actionable categories, will need to be validated in different TBI populations.

AB BACKGROUND: Readmissions after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are common. However, the few currently available AMI readmission risk prediction models have poor-to-modest predictive ability and are not readily actionable in real time. We sought to develop an actionable and accurate AMI readmission risk prediction model to identify high-risk patients as early as possible during hospitalization.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We used electronic health record data from consecutive AMI hospitalizations from 6 hospitals in north Texas from 2009 to 2010 to derive and validate models predicting all-cause nonelective 30-day readmissions, using stepwise backward selection and 5-fold cross-validation. Of 826 patients hospitalized with AMI, 13% had a 30-day readmission. The first-day AMI model (the AMI "READMITS" score) included 7 predictors: renal function, elevated brain natriuretic peptide, age, diabetes mellitus, nonmale sex, intervention with timely percutaneous coronary intervention, and low systolic blood pressure, had an optimism-corrected C-statistic of 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.74) and was well calibrated. The full-stay AMI model, which included 3 additional predictors (use of intravenous diuretics, anemia on discharge, and discharge to postacute care), had an optimism-corrected C-statistic of 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.76) with minimally improved net reclassification and calibration. Both AMI models outperformed corresponding multicondition readmission models.; CONCLUSIONS: The parsimonious AMI READMITS score enables early prospective identification of high-risk AMI patients for targeted readmissions reduction interventions within the first 24hours of hospitalization. A full-stay AMI readmission model only modestly outperformed the AMI READMITS score in terms of discrimination, but surprisingly did not meaningfully improve reclassification. © 2018 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND: With the recent implementation of the Medicare Quality Payment Program, providers face increasing accountability for delivering high-quality care. Such pay-for-performance programs aim to leverage systematic data captured by electronic health record (EHR) systems to measure performance; however, the fidelity of EHR query for assessing performance has not been validated compared with manual chart review. We sought to determine whether our institution's methodology of EHR query could accurately identify cases in which providers failed to prescribe statins for eligible patients with coronary artery disease.; METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 9459 patients with coronary artery disease were seen at least twice at the Emory Clinic between July 2014 and June 2015, of whom 1338 (14.1%, 95% confidence interval 13.5-14.9%) had no statin prescription or exemption per EHR query. A total of 120 patient cases were randomly selected and reviewed by 2 physicians for further adjudication. Of the 120 cases initially classified as statin prescription failures, only 21 (17.5%; 95% confidence interval, 11.7-25.3%) represented true failure following physician review.; CONCLUSIONS: Sole reliance on EHR data query to measure quality metrics may lead to significant errors in assessing provider performance. Institutions should be cognizant of these potential sources of error, provide support to medical providers, and form collaborative data management teams to promote and improve meaningful use of EHRs. We propose actionable steps to improve the accuracy of EHR data query that require hypothesis testing and prospective validation in future studies. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Brain tumors remain the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children and often are associated with long-term sequelae among survivors of current therapies. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify actionable targets and to develop more effective therapies. Telomerase and telomeres play important roles in cancer, representing attractive therapeutic targets to treat children with poor-prognosis brain tumors such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), high-grade glioma (HGG), and high-risk medulloblastoma. We have previously shown that DIPG, HGG, and medulloblastoma frequently express telomerase activity. Here, we show that the telomerase-dependent incorporation of 6-thio-2'deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), a telomerase substrate precursor analogue, into telomeres leads to telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIF) along with extensive genomic DNA damage, cell growth inhibition, and cell death of primary stem-like cells derived from patients with DIPG, HGG, and medulloblastoma. Importantly, the effect of 6-thio-dG is persistent even after drug withdrawal. Treatment with 6-thio-dG elicits a sequential activation of ATR and ATM pathways and induces G2-M arrest. In vivo treatment of mice bearing medulloblastoma xenografts with 6-thio-dG delays tumor growth and increases in-tumor TIFs and apoptosis. Furthermore, 6-thio-dG crosses the blood-brain barrier and specifically targets tumor cells in an orthotopic mouse model of DIPG. Together, our findings suggest that 6-thio-dG is a promising novel approach to treat therapy-resistant telomerase-positive pediatric brain tumors.

AB The European Society for Medical Oncology defines rare cancers as 5 or fewer cases per 100,000 persons per year. For many rare cancers, no standard of care exists, and treatment is often extrapolated. Identifying potentially targetable genomic alterations in rare tumors is a rational approach to improving treatment options. We sought to catalog these mutations in rare tumors and to assess their clinical utility.For this retrospective analysis, we selected rare tumor patients from a dataset of patients who underwent clinical tumor genomic profiling. Sarcomas were excluded. To index potentially actionable alterations, patients' reports were reviewed for mutations in cancer-associated genes and pathways. Respective clinical records were abstracted to appraise the benefit of using a targeted therapy approach. Actionable alterations were defined as targeted by a drug available on-label, off-label, or in clinical trials.The 95 patients analyzed had 40 different tumor subtypes, most common being adenoid cystic (13%), cholangiocarcinoma (7%), and metaplastic breast (6%). At least one genomic alteration was identified in 87 patients (92%). The most common identifiable mutations were in TP53 (23%), KRAS (10%), PIK3CA (9%), CDKN2A/B (8%), BRAF (7%), MLL (7%), and ARID1A (6%). Thirty-six patients (38%) with 21 different tumors had at least one potentially actionable alteration. Thirteen patients received targeted therapy. Of these, 4 had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 3 had progressive disease as the best response.The addition of genomic profiling to management of rare cancers adds a potential line of therapy for cancers that have little or no standard of care. In our analysis, tumors with a BRAF alteration responded well to BRAF inhibitors. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(7); 1595-601. ©2018 AACR. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Cell motility and invasiveness are prerequisites for dissemination, and largely account for cancer mortality. We have identified an actionable kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which is keenly tightly associated with tumor progression in ovarian cancer. Here, we report that active recombinant SYK directly phosphorylates cortactin and cofilin, which are critically involved in assembly and dynamics of actin filament through phosphorylation signaling. Enhancing SYK activity by inducing expression of a constitutively active SYK mutant, SYK130E, increased growth factor-stimulated migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, which was abrogated by cortactin knockdown. Similarly, SYK inhibitors significantly decreased invasion of ovarian cancer cells across basement membrane in real-time transwell assays and in 3D tumor spheroid models. SYK inactivation by targeted gene knockout or by small molecule inhibition reduced actin polymerization. Collectively, this study reported a new mechanism by which SYK signaling regulates ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness, and suggest a target-based strategy to prevent or suppress the advancement of ovarian malignancies.

AB The objective was to combine cost analysis and participatory research to identify actionable cost-saving opportunities in public health services for sexually transmitted infections (STI). This study used a mixed-methods approach of analyzing Florida public health data, combined with participatory research approaches to data collection including quantitative web-based surveys, qualitative in-depth interviews, and group discussions. Florida surveillance and administrative data on STIs and county health department (CHD) costs of services for 2012 were analyzed in addition to primary data collected from all Florida CHDs during 2014 and 2015. Variations in STI service delivery practices were the primary variables of concern. Variations in practices, rather than demographic factors such as size of county or STI rates, were associated with variations in cost. Five identified variations in practices were rated for cost savings, no or minimal adverse health impact, and ease of implementation. Following discussion of the ratings by CHDs, texting STI test results was ranked highest for quality improvement implementation initiatives. This study provides a compelling example of how in-depth qualitative and quantitative follow-up research focused on discovery and development with the practice community provides critical insights for interpreting administrative data and drawing accurate reality-based conclusions. The research design was intended to be a highly adaptive research approach that adjusts to the political and technical circumstances of delivering public health services. The extensive stakeholder engagement throughout all phases the study enables this research to address and overcome potential barriers and challenges to actionable findings.

AB Reducing chronic disease is a major health challenge. Risk factors for chronic diseases are often studied at the individual level, even though interventions and policies may be implemented at the city level. We use an ecologic study design with city-level data, to simultaneously assess the relative impact of unhealthy behaviors and preventive care measures on multiple chronic disease health outcomes. We analyze a newly available, large national dataset called the 500 Cities Project. We examine the associations between city-level prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, clinical preventive service use, and all chronic disease health outcomes in 500 of the largest U.S. cities for year 2014. After adjusting for age and demographic characteristics, using MANOVA we found that the top three risk factors for all health outcomes are smoking (Pillai's trace = 0.95, approx. F = 688.7, p-value < 0.0001), lack of physical activity (Pillai's trace = 0.91, approx. F = 380.0, p-value < 0.0001) and binge drinking (Pillai's trace = 0.91, approx. F = 348.8, p-value < 0.0001), which are statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Higher prevalence of an annual dental checkup, a preventive service use measure, is correlated with lower prevalence of several chronic diseases such as diabetes (correlation coefficient r = -0.88), poor physical health (r = -0.91), stroke (r = -0.85), cardiovascular disease (r = -0.83) and poor mental health (r = -0.82). Identifying important chronic disease risk factors at the city-level may provide more actionable information for policymakers to improve urban health. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in whom intervention for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides was indicated based on National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines.; STUDY DESIGN: This multicenter, longitudinal cohort study included children with NAFLD enrolled in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network. Fasting lipid profiles were obtained at diagnosis. Standardized dietary recommendations were provided. After 1 year, lipid profiles were repeated and interpreted according to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction. Main outcomes were meeting criteria for clinically actionable dyslipidemia at baseline, and either achieving lipid goal at follow-up or meeting criteria for ongoing intervention.; RESULTS: There were 585 participants, with a mean age of 12.8 years. The prevalence of children warranting intervention for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at baseline was 14%. After 1 year of recommended dietary changes, 51% achieved goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 27% qualified for enhanced dietary and lifestyle modifications, and 22% met criteria for pharmacologic intervention. Elevated triglycerides were more prevalent, with 51% meeting criteria for intervention. At 1 year, 25% achieved goal triglycerides with diet and lifestyle changes, 38% met criteria for advanced dietary modifications, and 37% qualified for antihyperlipidemic medications.; CONCLUSIONS: More than one-half of children with NAFLD met intervention thresholds for dyslipidemia. Based on the burden of clinically relevant dyslipidemia, lipid screening in children with NAFLD is warranted. Clinicians caring for children with NAFLD should be familiar with lipid management.

AB PURPOSE: Multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy is touted as a tool to improve prostate cancer care and yet its true clinical usefulness over transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy has not been systematically analyzed. We introduce 2 metrics to better quantify and report the deliverables of targeted biopsy.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed our prospective database of patients who underwent simultaneous multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Actionable intelligence metric was defined as the proportion of patients in whom targeted biopsy provided actionable information over transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Reduction metric was defined as the proportion of men in whom transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy could have been omitted. We compared metrics in our cohort with those in prior reports.; RESULTS: A total of 371 men were included in study. The actionable intelligence and reduction metrics were 22.2% and 83.6% in biopsy naive cases, 26.7% and 84.2% in prior negative transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy cases, and 24% and 77.5%, respectively, in active surveillance cases. No significant differences were observed among the groups in the actionable intelligence metric and the reduction metric (p = 0.89 and 0.27, respectively). The actionable intelligence metric was 25.0% for PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) 3, 27.5% for PI-RADS 4 and 21.7% for PI-RADS 5 lesions (p = 0.73). Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy could have been avoided in more patients with PI-RADS 3 compared to PI-RADS 4/5 lesions (reduction metric 92.0% vs 76.7%, p<0.01). Our results compare favorably to those of other reported series.; CONCLUSIONS: The actionable intelligence metric and the reduction metric are novel, clinically relevant quantification metrics to standardize the reporting of multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy deliverables. Targeted biopsy provides actionable information in about 25% of men. Reduction metric assessment highlights that transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy may only be omitted after carefully considering the risk of missing clinically significant cancers.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic sequencing in cancer (both tumour and germline), and development of therapies targeted to tumour genetic status, hold great promise for improvement of patient outcomes. However, the imminent introduction of genomics into clinical practice calls for better understanding of how patients value, experience, and cope with this novel technology and its often complex results. Here we describe a protocol for a novel mixed-methods, prospective study (PiGeOn) that aims to examine patients' psychosocial, cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to tumour genomic profiling and to integrate a parallel critical ethical analysis of returning results.; METHODS: This is a cohort sub-study of a parent tumour genomic profiling programme enrolling patients with advanced cancer. One thousand patients will be recruited for the parent study in Sydney, Australia from 2016 to 2019. They will be asked to complete surveys at baseline, three, and fivemonths. Primary outcomes are: knowledge, preferences, attitudes and values. A purposively sampled subset of patients will be asked to participate in three semi-structured interviews (at each time point) to provide deeper data interpretation. Relevant ethical themes will be critically analysed to iteratively develop or refine normative ethical concepts or frameworks currently used in the return of genetic information.; DISCUSSION: This will be the first Australian study to collect longitudinal data on cancer patients' experience of tumour genomic profiling. Findings will be used to inform ongoing ethical debates on issues such as how to effectively obtain informed consent for genomic profiling return results, distinguish between research and clinical practice and manage patient expectations. The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods will provide comprehensive and critical data on how patients cope with 'actionable' and 'non-actionable' results. This information is needed to ensure that when tumour genomic profiling becomes part of routine clinical care, ethical considerations are embedded, and patients are adequately prepared and supported during and after receiving results.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not required for this sub-study, parent trial registration ACTRN12616000908437 .

AB Identifying molecular cancer drivers is critical for precision oncology. Multiple advanced algorithms to identify drivers now exist, but systematic attempts to combine and optimize them on large datasets are few. We report a PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis spanning 9,423 tumor exomes (comprising all 33 of The Cancer Genome Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools to catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify 299 driver genes with implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequence- and structure-based analyses identified >3,400 putative missense driver mutations supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation confirmed 60%-85% of predicted mutations as likely drivers. We found that >300 MSI tumors are associated with high PD-1/PD-L1, and 57% of tumors analyzed harbor putative clinically actionable events. Our study represents the most comprehensive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to date and will serve as a blueprint for future biological and clinical endeavors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present the detection and characterization of a large number of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types usingTCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggestingahypothesis centered on "chromatin-state" to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA co-expression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed acomputational method to infer causal enhancer-gene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes. Having identified an enhancer 140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immunotherapy target, we validated it experimentally. This study provides a systematic view of enhancer activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the clinical implications of enhancers. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an emerging actionable phenotype in oncology that informs tumor response to immune checkpoint pathway immunotherapy. However, there remains a need for MSI diagnostics that are low cost, highly accurate, and generalizable across cancer types. We developed a method for targeted high-throughput sequencing of numerous microsatellite loci with pan-cancer informativity for MSI using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs).; METHODS: We designed a smMIP panel targeting 111 loci highly informative for MSI across cancers. We developed an analytical framework taking advantage of smMIP-mediated error correction to specifically and sensitively detect instability events without the need for typing matched normal material.; RESULTS: Using synthetic DNA mixtures, smMIPs were sensitive to at least 1% MSI-positive cells and were highly consistent across replicates. The fraction of identified unstable microsatellites discriminated tumors exhibiting MSI from those lacking MSI with high accuracy across colorectal (100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity), prostate (100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity), and endometrial cancers (95.8% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity). MSI-PCR, the current standard-of-care molecular diagnostic for MSI, proved equally robust for colorectal tumors but evidenced multiple false-negative results in prostate (81.8% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity) and endometrial (75.0% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity) tumors.; CONCLUSIONS: smMIP capture provides an accurate, diagnostically sensitive, and economical means to diagnose MSI across cancer types without reliance on patient-matched normal material. The assay is readily scalable to large numbers of clinical samples, enables automated and quantitative analysis of microsatellite instability, and is readily standardized across clinical laboratories. © 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB This paper reviews recent research on late-life depression (LLD) pharmacotherapy, focusing on updated information for monotherapy and augmentation treatments. We then review new research on moderators of clinical response and how to use the information for improved efficacy.; RECENT FINDINGS: A recent review shows that sertraline, paroxetine, and duloxetine were superior to placebo for the treatment of LLD. There is concern that paroxetine could have adverse outcomes in the geriatric population due to anticholinergic properties; however, studies show no increases in mortality, dementia risk, or cognitive measures. Among newer antidepressants, vortioxetine has demonstrated efficacy in LLD, quetiapine has demonstrated efficacy especially for patients with sleep disturbances, and aripiprazole augmentation for treatment resistance in LLD was found to be safe and effective. Researchers have also been identifying moderators of LLD that can guide treatment. Researchers are learning how to associate moderators, neuroanatomical models, and antidepressant response. SSRI/SNRIs remain first-line treatment for LLD. Aripiprazole is an effective and safe augmentation for treatment resistance. Studies are identifying actionable moderators that can increase treatment response.

AB Background: High throughput molecular screening techniques allow the identification of multiple molecular alterations, some of which are actionable and can be targeted by molecularly targeted agents (MTA). We aimed at evaluating the relevance of using this approach in the frame of Institut Curie Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) to guide patients with cancer to clinical trials with MTAs.; Patients and methods: We included all patients presented at Institut Curie MTB from 4 October 2014 to 31 October 2017. The following information was extracted from the chart: decision to perform tumour profiling, types of molecular analyses, samples used, molecular alterations identified and those which are actionable, and inclusion in a clinical trial with matched MTA.; Results: 736 patients were presented at the MTB. Molecular analyses were performed in 442 patients (60%). Techniques used included next-generation sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation array and/or other techniques including immunohistochemistry in 78%, 51% and 58% of patients, respectively. Analyses were performed on a fresh frozen biopsy in 91 patients (21%), on archival tissue (fixed or frozen) in 326 patients (74%) and on both archival and fresh frozen biopsy in 25 patients (6%). At least one molecular alteration was identified in 280 analysed patients (63%). An actionable molecular alteration was identified in 207 analysed patients (47%). Forty-five analysed patients (10%) were enrolled in a clinical trial with matched MTA and 29 additional patients were oriented and included in a clinical trial based on a molecular alteration identified prior to the MTB analysis. Median time between date of specimen reception and molecular results was 28 days (range: 5-168).; Conclusions: The implementation of an MTB at Institut Curie enabled the inclusion of 10% of patients into a clinical trial with matched therapy.

AB Nutrition is an important component of public health and health care, including in education and research, and in the areas of policy and practice. This statement was the overarching message during the third annual International Summit on Medical Nutrition Education and Research, held at Wolfson College, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, in August 2017. This summit encouraged attendees to think more broadly about the impact of nutrition policy on health and communities, including the need to visualize the complete food system from "pre-farm to post-fork." Evidence of health issues related to food and nutrition were presented, including the need for translation of knowledge into policy and practice. Methods for this translation included the use of implementation and behavior change techniques, recognizing the needs of health-care professionals, policy makers, and the public. In all areas of nutrition and health, clear and effective messages, supported by open data, information, and actionable knowledge, are also needed along with strong measures of impact centered on an ultimate goal: to improve nutritional health and wellbeing for patients and the public.

AB Increasingly, individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) seek and provide support for relapse prevention in text-based online environments such as discussion forums. This paper investigates whether language use within a peer-to-peer discussion forum can predict future relapse among individuals treated for AUD. A total of 104 AUD sufferers who had completed residential treatment participated in a mobile phone-based relapse-prevention program, where they communicated via an online forum over the course of a year. We extracted patterns of language use on the forum within the first four months on study using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a dictionary-based text analysis program. Participants reported their incidence of risky drinking via a survey at 4, 8, and 12 months. A logistic regression model was built to predict the likelihood that individuals would engage in risky drinking within a year based on their language use, while controlling for baseline characteristics and rates of utilizing the mobile system. Results show that all baseline characteristics and system use factors explained just 13% of the variance in relapse, whereas a small number of linguistic cues, including swearing and cognitive mechanism words, accounted for an additional 32% of the total 45% of variance in relapse explained by the model. Effective models for predicting relapse are needed. Messages exchanged on AUD forums could provide an unobtrusive and cost-effective window into the future health outcomes of AUD sufferers, and their psychological underpinnings. As online communication expands, models that leverage user-submitted text toward predicting relapse will be increasingly scalable and actionable.

AB Advance care planning (ACP) and goals of care designation (GCD) are being integrated into modern health care. In cirrhosis, uptake and adoption of these practices have been limited with physicians citing many perceived barriers and limitations. Recognizing the many tangible benefits of ACP and GCD processes in patients with life-limiting chronic diseases, the onus is on health practitioners to initiate and direct these conversations with their patients and surrogates. Drawing upon the literature and our experiences in palliative care and cirrhosis, we provide an actionable framework that can be readily implemented into a busy clinical setting by a practitioner. Conversation starters, visual aids, educational resources (for patients and practitioners), and videos of mock physician-patient scenarios are presented and discussed. Importantly, we have customized each of these tools to meet the unique health care needs of patients with cirrhosis. The inherent flexibility of our approach to ACP discussions and GCD can be further modified to accommodate practitioner preferences.; CONCLUSION: In our clinics, this assemblage of "best practice tools" has been well received by patients and surrogates enabling us to increase the number of outpatients with cirrhosis who have actively contributed to their GCD before acute health events and are supported by well-informed surrogates.

AB In an influenza pandemic, two vaccine doses administered 21days apart may be needed for individuals of all ages to achieve seroprotection. Achieving dose-series completion can be challenging even for routinely recommended vaccines. To prepare for a two-dose influenza pandemic vaccine campaign and promote dose-series completion and correct dosing intervals, CDC and its partners developed a text message-based vaccine reminder system to remind persons who receive a first dose of pandemic influenza vaccine to receive the second dose. Taking advantage of the high prevalence of cell phones in the United States, the system sent second-dose text message reminders and hyperlinks to educational information. The system was pilot tested from November 2015 to April 2016 among graduate public health students enrolled at four United States universities. Universities were selected based on convenience, and each university used a different recruitment method. Among 59 volunteers who pilot tested the system and completed a survey, 57 (92%) felt the system would be helpful during a pandemic. Forty (68%) respondents felt the information included in the messages was informative. Volunteers recommended including actionable ways to stay healthy during a pandemic, though specific suggestions varied. With further development, text reminder systems could be used to promote adherence to a two-dose regimen in a future pandemic, although audience-specific messaging and other complementary systems will likely be needed. Public and private partners can adapt and implement this tool in conjunction with their routine patient information systems to improve dose-series completion and ensure optimal protection during an influenza pandemic.

AB Background: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as a major post-transcriptional mechanism for gene regulation, and dysregulation of APA contributes to several human diseases. However, the functional consequences of APA in human cancer are not fully understood. Particularly, there is no large-scale analysis in cancer cell lines.; Methods: We characterized the global APA profiles of 6398 patient samples across 17 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 739 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. We built a linear regression model to explore the correlation between APA factors and APA events across different cancer types. We used Spearman correlation to assess the effects of APA events on drug sensitivity and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Cox proportional hazards model to identify clinically relevant APA events.; Results: We revealed a striking global 3'UTR shortening in cancer cell lines compared with tumor samples. Our analysis further suggested PABPN1 as the master regulator in regulating APA profile across different cancer types. Furthermore, we showed that APA events could affect drug sensitivity, especially of drugs targeting chromatin modifiers. Finally, we identified 1971 clinically relevant APA events, as well as alterations of APA in clinically actionable genes, suggesting that analysis of the complexity of APA profiles could have clinical utility.; Conclusions: Our study highlights important roles for APA in human cancer, including reshaping cellular pathways and regulating specific gene expression, exemplifying the complex interplay between APA and other biological processes and yielding new insights into the action mechanism of cancer drugs.

AB Background: In germline genetic testing, variants from understudied ancestries have been disproportionately classified as being of uncertain significance. We hypothesized that the rate of variant reclassification likewise differs by ancestry.; Methods: Nonbenign variants in actionable genes were collected from consenting subjects undergoing genetic testing at two Southern California sites from September 1996 through December 2016. Variant reclassifications were recorded as they were received, until February 2017 or reclassification to benign. Excluding duplicate variants (same ancestry, laboratory, classification), generalized linear models for the hereditary breast cancer genes (BRCA1/2) and other variants investigated whether rate of reclassification differed for seven categories of ancestry compared with non-Hispanic European. Models took into account laboratory, year, gene, sex, and current classification (handled as a time-dependent covariate) and were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.; Results: Among 1483 nonbenign variants, 693 (46.7%) involved BRCA1/2. Overall, 268 (18.1%) variants were reclassified at least once. Few (9.7%) reclassified variants underwent a net upgrade in pathogenicity. For BRCA1/2 variants, reclassification rates varied by ancestry and increased over time, more steeply for ancestries with lower initial rates (African, Ashkenazi, Chinese) than for ancestries whose initial rates were high (Middle Eastern) or similar to non-Hispanic European (non-Chinese Asian, Native American, Hispanic). In contrast, reclassification rates of non-BRCA1/2 variants did not vary over time but were elevated for most minority ancestries except non-Chinese Asian and Native American.; Conclusions: For nonbenign variants in cancer-related genes, the rates at which reclassifications are issued vary by ancestry in ways that differ between BRCA1/2 and other genes.

AB BACKGROUND: Studying the impact of genetic testing interventions on lifestyle behaviour change has been a priority area of research in recent years. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the results and conclusions of this literature, which has yet to be explained using validated behaviour change theory and an assessment of the quality of genetic interventions. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) helps to explain key contributors to behaviour change. It has been hypothesized that personalization could be added to this theory to help predict changes in health behaviours.; PURPOSE: This systematic review provides a detailed, comprehensive identification, assessment, and summary of primary research articles pertaining to lifestyle behaviour change (nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and smoking) resulting from genetic testing interventions. The present review further aims to provide in-depth analyses of studies conducted to date within the context of the TPB and the quality of genetic interventions provided to participants while aiming to determine whether or not genetic testing facilitates changes in lifestyle habits. This review is timely in light of a recently published "call-to-action" paper, highlighting the need to incorporate the TPB into personalized healthcare behaviour change research.; METHODS: Three bibliographic databases, one key website, and article reference lists were searched for relevant primary research articles. The PRISMA Flow Diagram and PRISMA Checklist were used to guide the search strategy and manuscript preparation. Out of 32,783 titles retrieved, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Three quality assessments were conducted and included: (1) risk of bias, (2) quality of genetic interventions, and (3) consideration of theoretical underpinnings - primarily the TPB.; RESULTS: Risk of bias in studies was overall rated to be "fair." Consideration of the TPB was "poor," with no study making reference to this validated theory. While some studies (n = 11; 42%) made reference to other behaviour change theories, these theories were generally mentioned briefly, and were not thoroughly incorporated into the study design or analyses. The genetic interventions provided to participants were overall of "poor" quality. However, a separate analysis of studies using controlled intervention research methods demonstrated the use of higher-quality genetic interventions (overall rated to be "fair"). The provision of actionable recommendations informed by genetic testing was more likely to facilitate behaviour change than the provision of genetic information without actionable lifestyle recommendations. Several studies of good quality demonstrated changes in lifestyle habits arising from the provision of genetic interventions. The most promising lifestyle changes were changes in nutrition.; CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to facilitate behaviour change using genetic testing as the catalyst. Future research should ensure that high-quality genetic interventions are provided to participants, and should consider validated theories such as the TPB in their study design and analyses.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aim to build an informatics methodology capable of identifying statistically significant associations between the clinical findings of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recorded in patient pathology reports and the various clinically actionable genetic mutations identified from next-generation sequencing (NGS) of patient tumor samples.; METHODS: We built an information extraction and analysis pipeline to identify the associations between clinical findings in the pathology reports of patients and corresponding genetic mutations. Our pipeline leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, large biomedical terminologies, semantic similarity measures, and clustering methods to extract clinical concepts in freetext from patient pathology reports and group them as salient findings.; RESULTS: In this study, we developed and applied our methodology to lobectomy surgical pathology reports of 142 NSCLC patients who underwent NGS testing and who had mutations in 4 oncogenes with clinical ramifications for NSCLC treatment (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA). Our approach identified 732 distinct positive clinical concepts in these reports and highlighted multiple findings with strong associations (P-value ≤ 0.05) to mutations in specific genes. Our assessment showed that these associations are consistent with the published literature.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an automatic pipeline to find statistically significant associations between clinical findings in unstructured text of patient pathology reports and genetic mutations. This approach is generalizable to other types of pathology and clinical reports in various disorders and can provide the first steps toward understanding the role of genetic mutations in the development and treatment of different types of cancer.

AB Brain injuries are complicated medical problems and their management requires data from disparate sources to extract actionable information. In neurocritical care, interoperability is lacking despite the perceived benefits. Several efforts have been underway, but none have been widely adopted, underscoring the difficulty of achieving this goal. We have identified the current pain points of data collection and integration based on the experience with two large multi-site clinical studies: Transforming Research And Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) in the United States and Collaborative European Neuro Trauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) in Europe. The variability of measurements across sites remains a barrier to uniform data collection. We found a need for annotation standards and for a standardized archive format for high-resolution data. Overall, the hidden cost for successful data collection was initially underestimated.Although the use of bedside data integration solutions, such as the Moberg's Component Neuromonitoring System (Moberg Research, Inc., Ambler, PA, USA) or ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, UK), facilitated the homogenous collection of synchronized data, there remain issues that need to be addressed by the neurocritical care community. To this end, we have organized a Working Group on Neurocritical Care Informatics, whose next step is to create an overarching informatics framework that takes advantage of the collected information to answer scientific questions and to accelerate the translation of trial results to actions benefitting military medicine.

AB Breast tumors of the basal-like, hormone receptor-negative subtype remain an unmet clinical challenge, as there is high rate of recurrence and poor survival in patients following treatment. Coevolution of the malignant mammary epithelium and its underlying stroma instigates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to support most, if not all, hallmarks of cancer progression. Here we delineate a previously unappreciated role for CAFs as determinants of the molecular subtype of breast cancer. We identified paracrine crosstalk between cancer cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-CC and CAFs expressing the cognate receptors in human basal-like mammary carcinomas. Genetic or pharmacological intervention of PDGF-CC activity in mouse models of cancer resulted in conversion of basal-like breast cancers into a hormone receptor-positive state that enhanced sensitivity to endocrine therapy in previously resistant tumors. We conclude that specification of breast cancer to the basal-like subtype is under microenvironmental control and is therapeutically actionable.

AB Neuroblastoma is a rare solid tumour of infancy and early childhood with a disproportionate contribution to paediatric cancer mortality and morbidity. Combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy remains the standard approach to treat high-risk disease, with few recurrent, actionable genetic aberrations identified at diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that actionable aberrations are far more common in relapsed neuroblastoma, possibly as a result of clonal expansion. In addition, although the major validated disease driver, MYCN, is not currently directly targetable, multiple promising approaches to target MYCN indirectly are in development. We propose that clinical trial design needs to be rethought in order to meet the challenge of providing rigorous, evidence-based assessment of these new approaches within a fairly small patient population and that experimental therapies need to be assessed at diagnosis in very-high-risk patients rather than in relapsed and refractory patients.

AB Big data are a major driver in the development of precision medicine. Efficient analysis methods are needed to transform big data into clinically-actionable knowledge. To accomplish this, many researchers are turning toward machine learning (ML), an approach of artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes modern algorithms to give computers the ability to learn. Much of the effort to advance ML for precision medicine has been focused on the development and implementation of algorithms and the generation of ever larger quantities of genomic sequence data and electronic health records. However, relevance and accuracy of the data are as important as quantity of data in the advancement of ML for precision medicine. For common diseases, physiological genomic readouts in disease-applicable tissues may be an effective surrogate to measure the effect of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions that underlie disease development and progression. Disease-applicable tissue may be difficult to obtain, but there are important exceptions such as kidney needle biopsy specimens. As AI continues to advance, new analytical approaches, including those that go beyond data correlation, need to be developed and ethical issues of AI need to be addressed. Physiological genomic readouts in disease-relevant tissues, combined with advanced AI, can be a powerful approach for precision medicine for common diseases.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.

AB Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) transformed HIV into a chronic disease but its individual and public health benefits depend on high levels of adherence. The large and rising number of people on ART, now also used as prevention, puts considerable strain on health systems and providers in low and middle as well as high-income countries, which are our focus here. Delivering effective adherence support is thus crucial but challenging, especially given the promotion of patient-centredness and shared decision making in HIV care. To illuminate the complexities of ART adherence support delivered in and through clinical encounters, we conducted a multi-disciplinary interpretative literature review. We reviewed and synthesized 82 papers published post 1997 (when ART was introduced) belonging to three bodies of literature: public health and psychological studies of ART communication; anthropological and sociological studies of ART; and conversation analytic studies of patient-centredness and shared decision-making. We propose three inter-related tensions which make patient-centredness particularly complex in this infectious disease context: achieving trust versus probing about adherence; patient-centredness versus reaching public health targets; and empowerment versus responsibilisation as 'therapeutic citizens'. However, there is a dearth of evidence concerning how precisely ART providers implement patient-centredness, shared-decision making in practice, and enact trust and therapeutic citizenship. We show how conversation analysis could lead to new, actionable insights in this respect. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Precision treatment of cancer uses biomarker-driven therapy to individualize and optimize patient care.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate real-life clinical experience with biomarker-driven therapy in metastatic gastric and esophageal cancer in Israel.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study included patients with metastatic gastric or esophageal cancer who were treated in the participating institutions and underwent biomarker-driven therapy. Treatment was considered to have a benefit if the ratio between the longest progression-free survival (PFS) post biomarker-driven therapy and the last PFS before the biomarker-driven therapy was ≥1.3. The null hypothesis was that ≤15% of patients gain such benefit.; RESULTS: The analysis included 46 patients (61% men; median age, 58years; 57% with poorly-differentiated tumors). At least one actionable (i.e., predictive of response to a specific therapy) biomarker was identified for each patient. Immunohistochemistry was performed on all samples and identified 1-8 (median: 3) biomarkers per patient (most commonly: low TS, high TOPO1, high TOP2A). Twenty-eight patients received therapy after the biomarker analysis (1-4 lines). In the 1st line after biomarker analysis, five patients (18%) achieved a partial response and five (18%) stable disease; the median (range) PFS was 129 (12-1155) days. Twenty-four patients were evaluable for PFS ratio analysis; in seven (29.2%), the ratio was ≥1.3. In a one-sided exact binomial test vs. the null hypothesis, p=0.019; therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that implementing biomarker-driven analysis is feasible and could provide clinical benefit for a considerable proportion (~30%) of patients with metastatic gastric or esophageal cancer.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: Regional, coordinated care for time-sensitive and high-risk medical conditions is a priority in the United States. A necessary precursor to coordinated regional care is regions that are actionable from clinical and policy standpoints. The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, the major health care referral construct in the United States, uses regions that cross state and county boundaries, limiting fiscal or political ownership by key governmental stakeholders in positions to create incentive and regulate regional care coordination. Our objective is to develop and evaluate referral regions that define care patterns forpatients with acute myocardial infraction, acute stroke, or trauma, yetalso preserve essential political boundaries.; METHODS: We developed a novel set of acute care referral regions using Medicare data in the United States from 2011. For acute myocardial infraction, acute stroke, or trauma, we iteratively aggregated counties according to patient home location and treating hospital address, using a spatial algorithm. We evaluated referral political boundary preservation and spatial accuracy for each set of referral regions.; RESULTS: The new set of referral regions, the Pittsburgh Atlas, had 326 distinct regions. These referral regions did not cross any county or state borders, whereas 43.1% and 98.1% of all Dartmouth Atlas hospital referral regions crossed county and state borders. The Pittsburgh Atlas was comparable to the Dartmouth Atlas in measures of spatial accuracy and identified larger at-risk populations for all 3 conditions.; CONCLUSION: A novel and straightforward spatial algorithm generated referral regions that were politically actionable and accountable for time-sensitive medical emergencies.

AB In the United States, breast cancer is the most common invasive malignancy and the second most common cause of death from cancer in women. Reproductive factors, estrogen, and progesterone have major causal roles, but concerns about other potential causes in the external environment continue to drive research inquiries and stimulate calls for action at the policy level. The environment is defined as anything that is not genetic and includes social, built, and chemical toxicant aspects. This review covers the scope of known and suspected environmental factors that have been associated with breast cancer and illustrates how epidemiology, toxicology, and mechanistic studies work together to create the full picture of environmental effects on this malignancy. Newer approaches to risk-related evaluations may allow this field to move forward and more clearly delineate actionable environmental causes of this most common of cancers in women.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were successful to identify genetic factors robustly associated with lung cancer. This review aims to synthesize the literature in this field and accelerate the translation of GWAS discoveries into results that are closer to clinical applications. A chronologic presentation of published GWAS on lung cancer susceptibility, survival, and response to treatment is presented. The most important results are tabulated to provide a concise overview in one read. GWAS have reported 45 lung cancer susceptibility loci with varying strength of evidence and highlighted suspected causal genes at each locus. Some genetic risk loci have been refined to more homogeneous subgroups of lung cancer patients in terms of histologic subtypes, smoking status, gender, and ethnicity. Overall, these discoveries are an important step for future development of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers to personalize and improve the quality of care for patients. GWAS results are on the edge of offering new tools for targeted screening in high-risk individuals, but more research is needed if GWAS are to pay off the investment. Complementary genomic datasets and functional studies are needed to refine the underlying molecular mechanisms of lung cancer preliminarily revealed by GWAS and reach results that are medically actionable.

AB Purpose: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions benefit from treatment with ALK inhibitors (ALKi). Analysis of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA) may provide a noninvasive way to identify ALK fusions and actionable resistance mechanisms without an invasive biopsy.Patients and Methods: The Guardant360 (G360; Guardant Health) deidentified database of NSCLC cases was queried to identify 88 consecutive patients with 96 plasma-detected ALK fusions. G360 is a clinical cfDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) test that detects point mutations, select copy number gains, fusions, insertions, and deletions in plasma.Results: Identified fusion partners included EML4 (85.4%), STRN (6%), and KCNQ, KLC1, KIF5B, PPM1B, and TGF (totaling 8.3%). Forty-two ALK-positive patients had no history of targeted therapy (cohort 1), with tissue ALK molecular testing attempted in 21 (5 negative, 5 positive, and 11 tissue insufficient). Follow-up of 3 of the 5 tissue-negative patients showed responses to ALKi. Thirty-one patients were tested at known or presumed ALKi progression (cohort 2); 16 samples (53%) contained 1 to 3 ALK resistance mutations. In 13 patients, clinical status was unknown (cohort 3), and no resistance mutations or bypass pathways were identified. In 6 patients with known EGFR-activating mutations, an ALK fusion was identified on progression (cohort 4; 4 STRN, 1 EML4; one both STRN and EML4); five harbored EGFR T790M.Conclusions: In this cohort of cfDNA-detected ALK fusions, we demonstrate that comprehensive cfDNA NGS provides a noninvasive means of detecting targetable alterations and characterizing resistance mechanisms on progression.

AB BACKGROUND: In lung adenocarcinoma, molecular profiling of actionable genes has become essential to set up targeted therapies. However, the feasibility and the relevance of molecular profiling from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the context of meningeal metastasis have been poorly assessed.; METHODS: We selected patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harbouring metastatic cells in the CSF after cytological analysis. Seven samples from six patients were eligible for molecular testing of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) high-resolution melting curve analysis and Sanger sequencing after DNA extraction from the cell pellets of the CSF.; RESULTS: Five patients showed mutations in one or two actionable genes, two harboured an EGFR mutation (exons 19 and 21), one only a KRAS mutation, one both EGFR and KRAS mutations and one a BRAF mutation. In all cases, the results of mutation testing provided new major information for patient management, leading to therapeutic adaptation. CSF molecular analysis identified mutations not detected in other neoplastic sites for two patients. In one case, the EGFR p.Thr790Met was identified. CSF was also the only sample available for genetic testing for almost all patients at the time of disease progression.; CONCLUSIONS: When cancer cells are present in the CSF, the molecular profiling from the cell pellets is relevant, as it can detect supplemental or different mutations compared to a previous analysis of the primitive tumour or plasma cell-free DNA and allows the adaptation of the treatment strategy.

AB Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by short stature, a skin rash associated with sun exposure, and an elevated likelihood of developing cancers of essentially all types, beginning at an early age. Cancer is the leading cause of death for persons with BS, and its early onset results in a reported median lifespan of <30 years. With fewer than 300 documented cases since BS was first described in 1954, its rarity has challenged progress in advancing both the care of and the cure for persons with BS. Presently, there are no known clinically actionable targets specific to persons with this cancer predisposition syndrome, despite the fact that standard cancer treatments are often contraindicated or must be substantially modified for persons with BS. Herein, Zachary Rogers recounts his experience as a cancer patient with BS contemplating a substantially customized chemotherapy regimen that highlights the need for development of individualized treatments in the BS community. We also outline a patient-centered research and community action road map with the goal of improving and prolonging the lives of persons with Bloom syndrome, including the facilitation of precision medicine development specific to this condition. © 2018 Campbell et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Metastatic adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Because of their slow growth and relative rarity, there is limited evidence for systemic therapy regimens. Recently, molecular profiling studies have begun to reveal the genetic landscape of these poorly understood cancers, and new treatment possibilities are beginning to emerge. The objective is to use whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and analysis to better understand the genetic alterations underlying the pathology of metastatic and rare ACCs and determine potentially actionable therapeutic targets. We report five cases of metastatic ACC, not originating in the salivary glands, in patients enrolled in the Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) Program at the BC Cancer Agency. Genomic workup included whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, detailed analysis of tumor alterations, and integration with existing knowledge of drug-target combinations to identify potential therapeutic targets. Analysis reveals low mutational burden in these five ACC cases, and mutation signatures that are commonly observed in multiple cancer types. Notably, the only recurrent structural aberration identified was the well-described MYB-NFIB fusion that was present in four of five cases, and one case exhibited a closely related MYBL1-NFIB fusion. Recurrent mutations were also identified in BAP1 and BCOR, with additional mutations in individual samples affecting NOTCH1 and the epigenetic regulators ARID2, SMARCA2, and SMARCB1. Copy changes were rare, and they included amplification of MYC and homozygous loss of CDKN2A in individual samples. Genomic analysis revealed therapeutic targets in all five cases and served to inform a therapeutic choice in three of the cases to date. © 2018 Chahal et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Children with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may relapse despite response to radioactive iodine (RAI). Two children with multiply relapsed PTC underwent whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. A TPM3-NTRK1 fusion was identified in one tumor, with outlier NTRK1 expression compared to the TCGA thyroid cancer compendium and to Illumina BodyMap normal thyroid. This patient demonstrated resolution of multiple pulmonary nodules without toxicity on oral TRK inhibitor therapy. A RET fusion was identified in the second tumor, another potentially actionable finding. Identification of oncogenic drivers in recurrent pediatric PTC may facilitate targeted therapy while avoiding repeated RAI. © 2018 Ronsley et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) efforts have established catalogs of mutations relevant to cancer development. However, the clinical utility of this information remains largely unexplored. Here, we present the results of the first eight patients recruited into a clinical whole-genome sequencing (WGS) program in the United Kingdom. We performed PCR-free WGS of fresh frozen tumors and germline DNA at 75* and 30*, respectively, using the HiSeq2500 HTv4. Subtracted tumor VCFs and paired germlines were subjected to comprehensive analysis of coding and noncoding regions, integration of germline with somatically acquired variants, and global mutation signatures and pathway analyses. Results were classified into tiers and presented to a multidisciplinary tumor board. WGS results helped to clarify an uncertain histopathological diagnosis in one case, led to informed or supported prognosis in two cases, leading to de-escalation of therapy in one, and indicated potential treatments in all eight. Overall 26 different tier 1 potentially clinically actionable findings were identified using WGS compared with six SNVs/indels using routine targeted NGS. These initial results demonstrate the potential of WGS to inform future diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choice in cancer and justify the systematic evaluation of the clinical utility of WGS in larger cohorts of patients with cancer. © 2018 Schuh et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will invariably succumb to their disease. Thus there remains a pressing need for preclinical testing of new drugs and drug combinations for late-stage prostate cancer (PCa). Insights from the mCRPC genomic landscape have revealed that, in addition to sustained androgen receptor (AR) signaling, there are other actionable molecular alterations and distinct molecular subclasses of PCa; however, the rate at which this knowledge translates into patient care via current preclinical testing is painfully slow and inefficient. Here, we will highlight the issues involved and discuss a new translational platform, "the co-clinical trial project," to expedite current preclinical studies and optimize clinical trial and experimental drug testing. With this platform, in vivo preclinical and early clinical studies are closely aligned, enabling in vivo testing of drugs using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) in defined genetic contexts to personalize individual therapies. We will discuss the principles and essential components of this novel paradigm, representative success stories and future therapeutic options for mCRPC that should be explored.

AB Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is poorly responsive to systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and invariably fatal. Here we describe a screen of 94 drugs in 15 exome-sequenced MM lines and the discovery of a subset defined by loss of function of the nuclear deubiquitinase BRCA associated protein-1 (BAP1) that demonstrate heightened sensitivity to TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). This association is observed across human early passage MM cultures, mouse xenografts and human tumour explants. We demonstrate that BAP1 deubiquitinase activity and its association with ASXL1 to form the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase complex (PR-DUB) impacts TRAIL sensitivity implicating transcriptional modulation as an underlying mechanism. Death receptor agonists are well-tolerated anti-cancer agents demonstrating limited therapeutic benefit in trials without a targeting biomarker. We identify BAP1 loss-of-function mutations, which are frequent in MM, as a potential genomic stratification tool for TRAIL sensitivity with immediate and actionable therapeutic implications. © 2017, Kolluri et al.

AB INTRODUCTION: Immunity, for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), has been leveraged historically in the form of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) as positive modulators of immune response have been recent major breakthroughs in solid tumors. Areas covered: Emerging concepts and clinical data with CPIs in acute Myeloid Leukemia - the focus of this review- will be discussed. CPIs can potentially be effective in absence of 'actionable' mutations and are expected to be effective against poor-risk AML. Immune inhibitory checkpoint molecules are upregulated in both de novo and relapsed AML. Similar data also suggest role of checkpoint molecules in mediating resistance particularly to hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy, which can potentially be reversed by using checkpoint inhibitors. Expert commentary: Ongoing clinical trials in combination with HMAs are showing early promise, with doubling of response than that seen in historic controls. The optimal combinations of CPIs and the optimal space that they will fit in the continuum of AML therapies need lot of in depth work.

AB The French National Reference Center for Staphylococci currently uses DNA arrays and spa typing for the initial epidemiological characterization of Staphylococcus aureus strains. We here describe the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate retrospectively four distinct and virulent S. aureus lineages [clonal complexes (CCs): CC1, CC5, CC8, CC30] involved in hospital and community outbreaks or sporadic infections in France. We used a WGS bioinformatics pipeline based on de novo assembly (reference-free approach), single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, and on the inclusion of epidemiological markers. We examined the phylogeographic diversity of the French dominant hospital-acquired CC8-MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) Lyon clone through WGS analysis which did not demonstrate evidence of large-scale geographic clustering. We analyzed sporadic cases along with two outbreaks of a CC1-MSSA (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) clone containing the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and results showed that two sporadic cases were closely related. We investigated an outbreak of PVL-positive CC30-MSSA in a school environment and were able to reconstruct the transmission history between eight families. We explored different outbreaks among newborns due to the CC5-MRSA Geraldine clone and we found evidence of an unsuspected link between two otherwise distinct outbreaks. Here, WGS provides the resolving power to disprove transmission events indicated by conventional methods (same sequence type, spa type, toxin profile, and antibiotic resistance profile) and, most importantly, WGS can reveal unsuspected transmission events. Therefore, WGS allows to better describe and understand outbreaks and (inter-)national dissemination of S. aureus lineages. Our findings underscore the importance of adding WGS for (inter-)national surveillance of infections caused by virulent clones of S. aureus but also substantiate the fact that technological optimization at the bioinformatics level is still urgently needed for routine use. However, the greatest limitation of WGS analysis is the completeness and the correctness of the reference database being used and the conversion of floods of data into actionable results. The WGS bioinformatics pipeline (EpiSeqTM) we used here can easily generate a uniform database and associated metadata for epidemiological applications.

AB PURPOSE: Population BRCA1/BRCA2 screening identifies carriers irrespective of family history, yet this information is actionable for relatives. We examined familial communication rates and cascade testing in the screening setting and assessed sociodemographic and psychosocial predictors.; METHODS: Participants in a BRCA1/BRCA2 screening study of healthy Ashkenazi Jews self-administered a family communication questionnaire. Intent to communicate was determined before genetic status was known, along with result communication (carriers and noncarriers) 6 months and 2 years after enrollment. Carriers underwent in-depth interviews and provided cascade testing information.; RESULTS: In total, 88% (524/595) of questionnaire responders and 97% (30/32) of carriers informed at least one relative. In multivariate analysis, family history (P=0.005) and greater Satisfaction With Health Decision scores (P<0.001) predicted communication of results. Among carriers' adult first- and second-degree relatives, 71 (48%) had cascade testing, more commonly performed in first- (58%) than in second-degree relatives (26%, P=0.0002), and in females (56%) vs. males (36%, P=0.02). At least 11% remained uninformed.; CONCLUSION: Familial communication rates and characteristics in a screening setting parallel those reported by Cancer Genetics clinics. Universal screening circumvents dependence on familial disclosure. However, our finding that satisfaction-a potentially modifiable factor-predicts communication, raises the hypothesis that improving the testing experience could facilitate familial communication.

AB As population health becomes more of a focus of health care, providers are realizing that data outside of traditional clinical findings can provide a broader perspective on potential drivers of a patient's health status and can identify approaches to improving the effectiveness of care. However, many challenges remain before data related to the social determinants of health, such as environmental conditions and education levels, are as readily accessible and actionable as medical data are. Key challenges are a lack of consensus on standards for capturing or representing social determinants of health in electronic health records and insufficient evidence that once information on them has been collected, social determinants can be effectively addressed through referrals or other action tools. To address these challenges and effectively use social determinants in health care settings, we recommend creating national standards for representing data related to social determinants of health in electronic health records, incentivizing the collection of the data through financial or quality measures, and expanding the body of research that measures the impact of acting on the information collected.

AB BACKGROUND: Technology has progressed from single gene panel to large-scale genomic sequencing. This is raising expectations from clinicians and patients alike. The utility and performance of this technology in a clinical setting needs to be evaluated.; AIM: This pilot study investigated the feasibility of using exome-scale sequencing (ESS) to identify molecular drivers within cancers in real-time for Precision Oncology in the clinic.; METHODS: Between March 2014 and March 2015, the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre Alliance explored the feasibility and utility of ESS in a pilot study. DNA extracted from the tumour specimens underwent both ESS and targeted 'hotspot' sequencing (TS). Blood was taken for germline analysis. A multi-disciplinary molecular tumour board determined the clinical relevance of identified mutations; in particular, whether they were 'actionable' and/or 'druggable'.; RESULTS: Of 23 patients screened, 15 (65%) met the tissue requirements for genomic analysis. TS and ESS were successful in all cases. ESS identified pathogenic somatic variants in 73% (11/15 cases) versus 53% (8/15 cases) using TS. Clinically focused ESS identified 63 variants, consisting of 30 somatic variants (including all 13 identified by TS) and 33 germline variants. Overall, there were 48 unique variants. ESS had a clinical impact in 53% (8/15 cases); 47% (7/15 cases) were referred to the familial cancer clinic, and 'druggable' targets were identified in 53% (8/15 cases).; CONCLUSION: ESS of tumour DNA impacted clinical decision-making in 53%, with 20% more pathogenic variants identified through ESS than TS. The identification of germline variants in 47% was an unexpected finding. © 2018 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

AB RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVE: Guidelines recommend screening for risk factors associated with chronic diseases but current electronic prompts have limited effects. Our objective was to discover and rank associations between the presence of screens to plan more efficient prompts in primary care.; METHODS: Risk factors with the greatest impact on chronic diseases are associated with blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, glycaemic and lipid levels, smoking, alcohol use, diet, and exercise. We looked for associations between the presence of screens for these in electronic medical records. We used association rule mining to describe relationships among items, factor analysis to find latent categories, and Cronbach alpha to quantify consistency within latent categories.; RESULTS: Data from 92140 patients in or around Toronto, Ontario, were included. We found positive correlations (lift >1) between the presence of all screens. The presence of any screen was associated with confidence greater than 80% that other data on items with high prevalence (blood pressure, glycaemic and lipid levels, or smoking) would also be present. A cluster of rules predicting the presence of blood pressure were ranked highest using measures of interestingness such as standardized lift. We found 3 latent categories using factor analysis; these were laboratory tests, vital signs, and lifestyle factors; Cronbach alpha ranged between .58 for lifestyle factors and .88 for laboratory tests.; CONCLUSIONS: Associations between the provision of important screens can be discovered and ranked. Rules with promising combinations of associated screens could be used to implement data driven alerts. © 2018 The Authors Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Research increasingly means that patients, caregivers, health professionals, other stakeholders, and academic investigators work in partnership. This requires effective collaboration rooted in mutual respect, involvement of all participants, and good communication. Having conducted such partnered research over multiple projects, and having recently completed a project together funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, we collaboratively developed a list of 12 lessons we have learned about how to ensure effective research partnerships. To foster a culture of mutual respect, hold early in-person meetings, with introductions focused on motivation, offer appropriate orientation for everyone, and maintain awareness of individual and project goals. To actively involve all team members, it is important to ensure sufficient funding for everyone's participation, to ask for and recognize diverse contributions, and to seek the input of quiet members. To facilitate good communication, teams should carefully consider labels, avoid jargon and acronyms, judiciously use homogeneous and heterogeneous subgroups, and keep progress visible. In offering pragmatic, actionable lessons we have learned through our separate and shared experiences, we hope to help foster more patient-centered research via productive and enjoyable research collaborations.

AB PURPOSE: Heat illnesses are important and potentially fatal conditions among physically active individuals. We determined predictors of heat illness among enlistees in a large military population experiencing common physical activity patterns.; METHODS: We estimated the adjusted odds of mild (MHI) and severe (SHI) heat illness associated with demographic, health-related, and geographic factors among active-duty, US Army soldiers enlisting between January 2011 and December 2014 (N = 238,168) using discrete-time multivariable logistic regression analyses.; RESULTS: We observed 2612 incident cases of MHI and 732 incident cases of SHI during 427,922 person-years of follow-up, with a mean and median of 21.6 and 21 months per subject. During the first 6 duty months, 71.3% of the MHIs and 60.2% of the SHIs occurred, peaking at month 2. The odds of MHI quadrupled among those with prior SHI (odds ratio [OR], 4.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-6.03). Body mass index (BMI) extremes increased the odds substantially (OR at BMI ≥30 kg·m: for MHI, 1.41 (CI, 1.19-1.67); for SHI, 1.94 (CI, 1.47-2.56); OR at BMI <18.5 kg·m: for MHI, 1.50 (CI, 1.01-2.21); for SHI, 2.26 (CI, 1.16-4.39)). Tobacco use was associated with a 55% increase (CI, 1.37-1.77) in MHI odds. The odds of MHI increased if taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, or methylphenidate stimulants. Lower age and lower entry aptitude scores were associated with progressively increased MHI odds.; CONCLUSIONS: Most heat illnesses occurred at the outset of service, indicating the need for focused prevention methods at the initiation of military duty. Prior heat illness, BMI extremes, medications, and tobacco use represent potentially actionable risk factors to address by education, policy, and/or clinician intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) being an evidence-based treatment recommended for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), referral to PR seems to be low. Collating the evidence on referral rates and perceived barriers and enablers may help provide knowledge needed to increase referral.; OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this scoping review was to determine 1) the rate of referral of patients with COPD to PR by healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 2) the barriers and enablers to referral perceived by HCPs.; METHODS: The JBI scoping review manual was used. Ovid Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception until July 28, 2017. 245 non-duplicate articles were screened. Included articles reported referral rates and/or HCP perceived barriers and/or enablers to PR referral.; RESULTS: Forty-two studies were included. Twenty-eight observational studies reported referral rates ranging from 0% to 85%. Seven studies looking at the effects of different interventions to improve COPD care reported a range of 2%-56% referral pre-intervention, and 8%-71% post-intervention. Nine studies reported HCP perceived barriers to referral. The two most common barriers were low knowledge of what PR is and its benefits and low knowledge of the referral process. Six studies reported HCP perceived enablers to referral. The most common enabler was training/experience in PR.; CONCLUSION: The rate of referral to PR is suboptimal, but there are commonly reported barriers and enablers that may help with the creation of actionable changes. HCPs need more knowledge of PR and the benefits it provides. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer cells rewires cellular signalling pathways through changes in the patterns of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Understanding these patterns may facilitate the design of tailored cancer therapies. Here, we show that single-molecule pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation techniques can be used to characterize signalling complexes of the human epidermal growth-factor receptor (HER) family in specific cancers. By analysing cancer-specific signalling phenotypes, including post-translational modifications and PPIs with downstream interactions, we found that activating mutations of the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) gene led to the formation of large protein complexes surrounding mutant EGFR proteins and to a reduction in the dependency of mutant EGFR signalling on phosphotyrosine residues, and that the strength of HER-family PPIs is correlated with the strength of the dependence of breast and lung adenocarcinoma cells on HER-family signalling pathways. Furthermore, using co-immunoprecipitation profiling to screen for EGFR-dependent cancers, we identified non-small-cell lung cancers that respond to an EGFR-targeted inhibitor. Our approach might help predict responses to targeted cancer therapies, particularly for cancers that lack actionable genomic mutations.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: Emergency department (ED) crowding and patient boarding are associated with increased mortality and decreased patient satisfaction. This study uses a positive deviance methodology to identify strategies among high-performing, low-performing, and high-performance improving hospitals to reduce ED crowding.; METHODS: In this mixed-methods comparative case study, we purposively selected and recruited hospitals that were within the top and bottom 5% of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services case-mix-adjusted ED length of stay and boarding times for admitted patients for 2012. We also recruited hospitals that showed the highest performance improvement in metrics between 2012 and 2013. Interviews were conducted with 60 key leaders (physicians, nurses, quality improvement specialists, and administrators).; RESULTS: We engaged 4 high-performing, 4 low-performing, and 4 high-performing improving hospitals, matched on hospital characteristics including geographic designation (urban versus rural), region, hospital occupancy, and ED volume. Across all hospitals, ED crowding was recognized as a hospitalwide issue. The strategies for addressing ED crowding varied widely. No specific interventions were associated with performance in length-of-stay metrics. The presence of 4 organizational domains was associated with hospital performance: executive leadership involvement, hospitalwide coordinated strategies, data-driven management, and performance accountability.; CONCLUSION: There are organizational characteristics associated with ED decreased length of stay. Specific interventions targeted to reduce ED crowding were more likely to be successfully executed at hospitals with these characteristics. These organizational domains represent identifiable and actionable changes that other hospitals may incorporate to build awareness of ED crowding.

AB Nonstandard insurers suffer from a peculiar variant of fraud wherein an overwhelming majority of claims have the semblance of fraud. We show that state-of-the-art fraud detection performs poorly when deployed at underwriting. Our proposed framework "FraudBuster" represents a new paradigm in predicting segments of fraud at underwriting in an interpretable and regulation compliant manner. We show that the most actionable and generalizable profile of fraud is represented by market segments with high confidence of fraud and high loss ratio. We show how these segments can be reported in terms of their constituent policy traits, expected loss ratios, support, and confidence of fraud. Overall, our predictive models successfully identify fraud with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.63 and an f-1 score of 0.769.

AB Research that is integral into a 'learning healthcare system' can promote cost effective services and knowledge creation. As such, research is defined as a 'core function' in UK health service organisations, and is often planned through research and development (R&D) strategies that aim to promote research activity and research capacity development (RCD). The discussion focuses around the content of ten R&D strategies for healthcare organisations in England and Scotland, with respect to RCD. These organisations were engaged with a research interest network called ACORN (Addressing Organisational Capacity to do Research Network) that included two Scottish Health Boards, four community and mental health trusts, two provincial district hospitals, and two teaching hospitals. We undertook a thematic documentary analysis of the R&D strategies which identified 11 'core activities' of RCD. The potential for building research capacity in these 'core activities' was established by reviewing them through the lens of a RCD framework. Core activities aimed to 'hard wire' RCD into health organisations. They demonstrated a complex interplay between developing a strong internal organisational infrastructure, and supporting individual career planning and skills development, in turn enabled by organisational processes. They also included activities to build stronger inter-organisational relationships and networks. Practitioner, manager and patient involvement was a cross cutting theme. The potential to demonstrate progress was included in plans through monitoring activity across all RCD principles. Strategies were primarily aimed at research production rather than research use. Developing 'actionable dissemination' was poorly addressed in the strategies, and represents an area for improvement. We describe strengths of RCD planning activities, and opportunities for improvement. We explore how national policy and research funders can influence health systems' engagement in research.

AB BACKGROUND: The ability to capture the complexities of healthcare practices and the quick turnaround of findings make rapid ethnographies appealing to the healthcare sector, where changing organisational climates and priorities require actionable findings at strategic time points. Despite methodological advancement, there continue to be challenges in the implementation of rapid ethnographies concerning sampling, the interpretation of findings and management of field research. The purpose of this review was to explore the benefits and challenges of using rapid ethnographies to inform healthcare organisation and delivery and identify areas that require improvement.; METHODS: This was a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the articles. We developed the search strategy using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Settingframework and searched for peer-reviewed articles in MEDLINE, CINAHL PLUS, Web of Science and ProQuest Central. We included articles that reported findings from rapid ethnographies in healthcare contexts or addressing issues related to health service use.; RESULTS: 26 articles were included in the review. We found an increase in the use of rapid ethnographies in the last 2years. We found variability in terminology and developed a typology to clarify conceptual differences. The studies generated findings that could be used to inform policy and practice. The main limitations of the studies were: the poor quality of reporting of study designs, mainly data analysis methods, and lack of reflexivity.; CONCLUSIONS: Rapid ethnographies have the potential to generate findings that can inform changes in healthcare practices in a timely manner, but greater attention needs to be paid to the reflexive interpretation of findings and the description of research methods.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017065874. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proposed as a suitable tool for liquid biopsy in colorectal cancer (CRC), although most studies to date have focused almost exclusively on sequencing of panels of potential clinically actionable genes. We evaluated the clinical value of whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in plasma, with the goal of identifying differential clinical profiles in patients with CRC. To this end, we applied an original concept, "differential presence of exons" (DPE). We determined differences in levels of 379 exons in plasma cfDNA and used DPE analysis to cluster and classify patients with disseminated and localized disease. The resultant bioinformatics analysis pipeline allowed us to design a predictive DPE algorithm in a small subset of patients that could not be initially classified based on the selection criteria. This DPE suggests that these nucleic acids could be actively released by both tumor and nontumor cells as a means of intercellular communication and might thus play a role in the process of malignant transformation. DPE is a new technique for the study of plasma cfDNA by WES that might have predictive and prognostic value in patients with CRC. © 2018 The Authors.

AB Although oncogenic activation of NFkappaB has been identified in various tumors, the NFkappaB-activating kinases (inhibitor of NFkappaB kinases, IKK) responsible for this are elusive. In this study, we determined the role of IKKalpha and IKKbeta in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas induced by the carcinogen urethane and by respiratory epithelial expression of oncogenic KRASG12D Using NFkappaB reporter mice and conditional deletions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, we identified two distinct early and late activation phases of NFkappaB during chemical and genetic lung adenocarcinoma development, which were characterized by nuclear translocation of RelB, IkappaBbeta, and IKKalpha in tumor-initiated cells. IKKalpha was a cardinal tumor promoter in chemical and genetic KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, and respiratory epithelial IKKalpha-deficient mice were markedly protected from the disease. IKKalpha specifically cooperated with mutant KRAS for tumor induction in a cell-autonomous fashion, providing mutant cells with a survival advantage in vitro and in vivo IKKalpha was highly expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma, and a heat shock protein 90 inhibitor that blocks IKK function delivered superior effects against KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma compared with a specific IKKbeta inhibitor. These results demonstrate an actionable requirement for IKKalpha in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, marking the kinase as a therapeutic target against this disease.Significance: These findings report a novel requirement for IKKalpha in mutant KRAS lung tumor formation, with potential therapeutic applications.

AB Increasingly, for a variety of indications, patients have their genomes sequenced and actionable results returned. A subset of returned results is pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants involved in the metabolism or action of medications. Although the impact of these variants on health is well-documented, little research exists on how to communicate these findings to patients and clinicians. We conducted semistructured interviews with end users to understand how best to communicate PGx results. Overall, patients and clinicians had similar opinions regarding report content, delivery, and application. Unique concerns specific to each stakeholder group were also expressed. Patients wanted an easy-to-understand individualized report that clinicians utilized to guide their care. Clinicians wanted reports that were easy-to-use, actionable, and integrated into their workflow. Implementation of these reports in a clinical setting will allow for broader user feedback and iterative improvement. © 2018 The Authors.

AB INTRODUCTION: Multiple therapeutic options now exist for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). In this study we evaluated treatment patterns and outcomes in mNSCLC patients who received first-line (1L), second-line (2L), and third-line (3L) therapy.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted using an electronic health record database of mNSCLC patients who received initial treatment from January 2012 through April 2016, with follow-up through June 2016. Patient characteristics and treatment patterns were characterized. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.; RESULTS: We identified 10,689 1L patients. Median age was 68 years, and 5816 (54%) were male. Most patients (6337; 59%) had a performance status of 1, and 8282 (77%) had nonsquamous histology. 1L treatment was chemotherapy in 9969 (93%) patients, and targeted therapy in 685 (6%). Median OS (mOS) for all patients in 1L was 12.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-12.7), and 24.3 months in 1L patients receiving targeted therapy. Among patients who received 2L therapy (n= 4235), 2790 (66%), 718 (17%), and 727 (17%) received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, respectively. mOS from 2L therapy was 9.6 months (95% CI, 9.1-10.1). In patients receiving 3L therapy (n= 1580), 921 (58%), 355 (22%), and 304 (19%) received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, respectively. mOS from 3L therapy was 8.2 months (95% CI, 7.3-8.7).; CONCLUSION: Targeted therapy and immunotherapy was most frequently used in the 2L and 3L setting during the study time frame. Survival differences observed according to treatment types are likely because of biologic differences, and suggest that patients with actionable mutations have a survival advantage.

AB FGFR-TACC fusions, including FGFR3-TACC3, have been identified as potential oncogenic drivers and actionable alterations in a number of different cancer types. The clinical relevance of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in endometrial cancer has not yet been described. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded metastatic endometrial carcinoma from the spleen and peritoneum were sent for comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using the FoundationOne platform as part of a prospective tumor genomic profiling protocol. We report the identification of an FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in a case of metastatic endometrioid endometrial cancer. Other potentially actionable alterations detected in this specimen included PIK3CA T1025S and an uncharacterized rearrangement involving TSC2 The patient initially received an FGFR inhibitor as an investigational agent and experienced stable disease with complete resolution of a pelvic nodule; however, treatment had to be discontinued because of intolerable side effects. A PET/CT scan nearly 3 mo after discontinuation showed disease progression. She subsequently received the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, later accompanied by letrozole, and achieved stable disease. Clinical benefit was attributed to the mTOR inhibitor as tumor stained negative for estrogen receptor. Temsirolimus was discontinued after >17 mo because of disease progression. FGFR inhibitors may have clinical benefit in the treatment of endometrial carcinoma with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions. Additionally, clinical benefit from an mTOR inhibitor may reflect a response to targeting the alteration in PIK3CA or TSC2 More research is needed to understand the activity of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions on tumors and to discover additional therapeutic options for endometrial carcinoma patients with this gene fusion. © 2018 Dhami et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to summarize the research on genetic risk scores and their ability to improve risk prediction in both a primary and a secondary prevention population.; RECENT FINDINGS: Several groups have examined the role of genetic scores in different patient populations. Recent studies have capitalized on the growing number of identified genetic variants to construct polygenic risk scores that include hundreds and sometimes thousands of SNPs. Also, recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with high genetic risk scores can attenuate their risk with lifestyle modifications and with statins, for which the benefit of treatment may be greater in those at highest genetic risk. Genetic risk scores when added to existing clinical models appear to improve risk prediction, particularly in the setting of incident cardiovascular disease and may provide actionable information to optimize prevention early in life. Future research will need to establish how to best use this genetic risk information either as a means to further individualize treatment decisions or to better identify high-risk populations.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Metastatic prostate cancer is a lethal and highly heterogeneous malignancy, associated with a broad spectrum of potentially actionable molecular alterations. In the past decade, disease profiling has expanded to include not only traditional tumor tissue, but also liquid biopsies of cells and genetic material circulating in the blood. These liquid biopsies offer a minimally invasive, repeatable source of tumor material for longitudinal disease profiling but also raise new technical and biological challenges. Here we will summarize recent advances in liquid biopsy strategies and the role they have played in biomarker development and disease management.; RECENT FINDINGS: Technologies for analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) continue to evolve rapidly, and the latest high content scanning platforms have underscored the phenotypic heterogeneity of CTC populations. Among liquid biopsies, CTC enumeration remains the most extensively validated prognostic marker to date, but other clinically relevant phenotypes like androgen receptor (AR) localization or presence of AR-V7 splice variant are important new predictors of therapy response. Serial genomic profiling of CTCs or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is helping to define primary and acquired resistance mechanisms and helping to guide patient selection for targeted therapies such as poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition. The era of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers has arrived, driven by powerful new enrichment and analysis techniques. As new blood-based markers are identified, their biological significance as disease drivers must be elucidated to advance new therapeutic strategies, and their clinical impact must be translated through assay standardization, followed by analytical and clinical validation. These efforts, already ongoing on multiple fronts, constitute the critical steps toward more effective precision management of advanced prostate cancer.

AB PURPOSE: Secondary findings from genomic sequencing are becoming more common. We compared how health-care providers with and without specialized genetics training anticipated responding to different types of secondary findings.; METHODS: Providers with genomic sequencing experience reviewed five secondary-findings reports and reported attitudes and potential clinical follow-up. Analyses compared genetic specialists and physicians without specialized genetics training, and examined how responses varied by secondary finding.; RESULTS: Genetic specialists scored higher than other providers on four-point scales assessing understandings of reports (3.89 vs. 3.42, p=0.0002), and lower on scales assessing reporting obligations (2.60 vs. 3.51, p<0.0001) and burdens of responding (1.73 vs. 2.70, p<0.0001). Nearly all attitudes differed between findings, although genetic specialists were more likely to assert that laboratories had no obligations when findings had less-established actionability (p<0.0001 in interaction tests). The importance of reviewing personal and family histories, documenting findings, learning more about the variant, and recommending familial discussions also varied according to finding (all p<0.0001).; CONCLUSION: Genetic specialists felt better prepared to respond to secondary findings than providers without specialized genetics training, but perceived fewer obligations for laboratories to report them, and the two groups anticipated similar clinical responses. Findings may inform development of targeted education and support.

AB Due to heterogeneous morphological and immunophenotypic features, approximately 50% of peripheral T-cell lymphomas are unclassifiable and categorized as peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified. These conditions have an aggressive course and poor clinical outcome. Identification of actionable biomarkers is urgently needed to develop better therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic alterations play a crucial role in tumor progression. Histone modifications, particularly methylation and acetylation, are generally involved in chromatin state regulation. Here we screened the core set of genes related to histone methylation (KMT2D, SETD2, KMT2A, KDM6A) and acetylation (EP300, CREBBP) and identified 59 somatic mutations in 45 of 125 (36.0%) patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified. Histone modifier gene mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival time of the patients, irrespective of chemotherapy regimens, but an increased response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide. In vitro, chidamide significantly inhibited the growth of EP300-mutated T-lymphoma cells and KMT2D-mutated T-lymphoma cells when combined with the hypomethylating agent decitabine. Mechanistically, decitabine acted synergistically with chidamide to enhance the interaction of KMT2D with transcription factor PU.1, regulated H3K4me-associated signaling pathways, and sensitized T-lymphoma cells to chidamide. In a xenograft KMT2D-mutated T-lymphoma model, dual treatment with chidamide and decitabine significantly retarded tumor growth and induced cell apoptosis through modulation of the KMT2D/H3K4me axis. Our work thus contributes to the understanding of aberrant histone modification in peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified and the stratification of a biological subset that can benefit from epigenetic treatment.

AB Introduction: The associations between Prostate cancer (PCa) and germline copy number variations (CNVs) in genome-wide level based on Chinese population are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify possible PCa-risk associated CNV regions in Chinese population. Materials and Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study for CNV in 1,417 PCa cases and 1,008 controls in Chinese population. Results: 7 risk-associated CNVs were identified for PCa after association analyses (P <7.2*10-6). Another 34 CNVs were found to be potentially risk-associated CNVs (P<0.05). Among the total 41 CNVs, 27 CNVs were risk variations and the other 14 were found to be protective of PCa. 25 of the CNVs (19 duplications and 6 deletions) were located in gene regions while 16 CNVs (9 duplications and 7 deletions) were located in intergenic regions. We identified a higher burden of gaining PCa-risk CNVs and a lower frequency of protective CNVs in cases than controls. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes related to PCa risk-associated CNVs were significantly enriched in some biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. Conclusion: These results provided additional information of genetic risks for PCa. Several CNV regions involved actionable genes that might be potential gene for target therapy. Additional validation and functional studies are warranted for these results.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this guideline is to provide updated recommendations for Canadian genetic counsellors, medical geneticists, maternal fetal medicine specialists, clinical laboratory geneticists and other practitioners regarding the use of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for prenatal diagnosis. This guideline replaces the 2011 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC)-Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) Joint Technical Update.; METHODS: A multidisciplinary group consisting of medical geneticists, genetic counsellors, maternal fetal medicine specialists and clinical laboratory geneticists was assembled to review existing literature and guidelines for use of CMA in prenatal care and to make recommendations relevant to the Canadian context. The statement was circulated for comment to the CCMG membership-at-large for feedback and, following incorporation of feedback, was approved by the CCMG Board of Directors on 5 June 2017 and the SOGC Board of Directors on 19 June 2017.; RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations include but are not limited to: (1) CMA should be offered following a normal rapid aneuploidy screen when multiple fetal malformations are detected (II-1A) or for nuchal translucency (NT) ≥3.5mm (II-2B) (recommendation 1); (2) a professional with expertise in prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis should provide genetic counselling to obtain informed consent, discuss the limitations of the methodology, obtain the parental decisions for return of incidental findings (II-2A) (recommendation 4) and provide post-test counselling for reporting of test results (III-A) (recommendation 9); (3) the resolution of chromosomal microarray analysis should be similar to postnatal microarray platforms to ensure small pathogenic variants are detected. To minimise the reporting of uncertain findings, it is recommended that variants of unknown significance (VOUS) smaller than 500Kb deletion or 1Mb duplication not be routinely reported in the prenatal context. Additionally, VOUS above these cut-offs should only be reported if there is significant supporting evidence that deletion or duplication of the region may be pathogenic (III-B) (recommendation 5); (4) secondary findings associated with a medically actionable disorder with childhood onset should be reported, whereas variants associated with adult-onset conditions should not be reported unless requested by the parents or disclosure can prevent serious harm to family members (III-A) (recommendation 8).The working group recognises that there is variability across Canada in delivery of prenatal testing, and these recommendations were developed to promote consistency and provide a minimum standard for all provinces and territories across the country (recommendation 9). © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB BACKGROUND: The integration of body-worn sensors with mobile devices presents a tremendous opportunity to improve just-in-time behavioral interventions by enhancing bidirectional communication between investigators and their participants. This approach can be used to deliver supportive feedback at critical moments to optimize the attainment of health behavior goals.; OBJECTIVE: The goals of this systematic review were to summarize data on the content characteristics of feedback messaging used in diet and physical activity (PA) interventions and to develop a practical framework for designing just-in-time feedback for behavioral interventions.; METHODS: Interventions that included just-in-time feedback on PA, sedentary behavior, or dietary intake were eligible for inclusion. Feedback content and efficacy data were synthesized descriptively.; RESULTS: The review included 31 studies (15/31, 48%, targeting PA or sedentary behavior only; 13/31, 42%, targeting diet and PA; and 3/31, 10%, targeting diet only). All studies used just-in-time feedback, 30 (97%, 30/31) used personalized feedback, and 24 (78%, 24/31) used goal-oriented feedback, but only 5 (16%, 5/31) used actionable feedback. Of the 9 studies that tested the efficacy of providing feedback to promote behavior change, 4 reported significant improvements in health behavior. In 3 of these 4 studies, feedback was continuously available, goal-oriented, or actionable.; CONCLUSIONS: Feedback that was continuously available, personalized, and actionable relative to a known behavioral objective was prominent in intervention studies with significant behavior change outcomes. Future research should determine whether all or some of these characteristics are needed to optimize the effect of feedback in just-in-time interventions. ©Susan M Schembre, Yue Liao, Michael C Robertson, Genevieve Fridlund Dunton, Jacqueline Kerr, Meghan E Haffey, Taylor Burnett, Karen Basen-Engquist, Rachel S Hicklen.

AB OBJECTIVES: RET fusions have been reported in 1-2% of lung adenocarcinomas, and represent an actionable target. Patients whose tumors possess RET fusion are associated with clinical benefit from the treatment with multi-kinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib and vandetanib. Further molecular screening for RET fusions is warranted. Novel KIF13A-RET fusion containing an intact RET kinase domain involving exons 1-18 of KIF13A and exons 12-20 of RET was identified in a lung cancer specimen from an 74-year-old Asian never smoker by next-generation sequencing (NGS) during clinical care. The patient was negative for EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and other putative driver alterations. Fusion analysis is consistent with other described RET fusions and is predicted to result in aberrant constitutive activation caused by dimerization and sensitivity to RET-directed therapies. We describe a novel RET-fusion with molecular characteristics consistent with RET-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Our case expands the spectrum of RET fusion partners and supports broad molecular profiling in non-small cell lung cancer optimizing patient therapeutic options. The new RET fusion has immediate clinical implications for cancer patients. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of research on the world beyond academia has increasingly become an area of focus in research performance assessments internationally. Impact assessment is expected to incentivise researchers to increase engagement with industry, government and the public more broadly. Increased engagement is in turn expected to increase translation of research so decision-makers can use research to inform development of policies, programs, practices, processes, products, and other mechanisms, through which impact can be realised. However, research has shown that various factors affect research use, and evidence on 'what works' to increase decision-makers' use of research is limited. The Conversation is an open access research communication platform, published under Creative Commons licence, which translates research into news articles to engage a general audience, aiming to improve understanding of current issues and complex social problems. To identify factors that predict use of academic research and expertise reported in The Conversation, regression analyses were performed using The Conversation Australia 2016 Annual Survey data. A broad range of factors predicted use, with engagement actions being the most common. Interestingly, different types of engagement actions predicted different types of use. This suggests that to achieve impact through increased engagement, a deeper understanding of how and why different engagement actions elicit different types of use is needed. Findings also indicate The Conversation is overcoming some of the most commonly identified barriers to the use of research: access, relevance, actionable outcomes, and timeliness. As such, The Conversation offers an effective model for providing access to and communicating research in a way that enables use, a necessary precursor to achieving research impact.

AB BACKGROUND: Many direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with the potential to affect efficacy and safety.; OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and severity of DDIs with DAAs identified by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) clinical pharmacist within a Veterans Affairs health care system.; METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with HCV treated with DAA therapy. Primary end points included the total number of identified DDIs, percentage of patients with at least 1 DDI, mean number of DDIs per patient, and the number of DDIs by severity category. Additional end points included characterization of interacting drugs, clinical consequence of interaction, intervention recommended, acceptance rate of actionable recommendations, and achievement of sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12).; RESULTS: A total of 300 patients were included. There were 554 identified DDIs, and 80.3% of patients had at least 1 DDI, with an average of 1.85 DDIs per patient; 76% of the DDIs identified were categorized as either a potentially clinically significant or critical interaction. The most common DDIs involved acid suppression agents (20%). Patient monitoring was the most commonly recommended intervention (59%), followed by dose modification of the interacting medication (30%). There was no difference in SVR12 between patients with at least 1 DDI compared with those with no DDIs (94.8% vs 95.8%; P = 0.73). There were a total of 227 actionable recommendations, with an acceptance rate of 84.1%.; CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that DDIs are prevalent among patients treated with DAAs for HCV. A HCV clinical pharmacist can help optimize patient care by identifying DDIs and recommending interventions to providers.

AB Cancer genome copy number alterations (CNAs) assist clinicians in selecting targeted therapeutics. Solid tumor CNAs are most commonly evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization is a sensitive and specific assay for interrogating preselected genomic regions, it provides no information about coexisting clinically significant copy number changes. Chromosomal microarray analysis is an alternative DNA-based method for interrogating genome-wide CNAs in solid tumors. However, DNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue produces an essential, yet problematic, sample type. The College of American Pathologists/American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for optimal tumor tissue handling, published in 2007 for breast cancer and in 2016 for gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, are lacking for other solid tumors. Thus, cold ischemia times are seldom monitored in non-breast cancer and non-gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, and all tumor biospecimens are affected by chemical fixation. Although intended to preserve specimens for long-term storage, formalin fixation causes loss of genetic information through DNA damage. Herein, we describe a reference size matching, whole-genome amplification, and fluorescent labeling method for FFPE-derived DNA designed to improve chromosomal microarray results from suboptimal nucleic acids and salvage highly degraded samples. With this technological advance, whole-genome copy number analysis of tumor DNA can be reliably performed in the clinical laboratory for a wide variety of tissue conditions and tumor types.

AB BACKGROUND: Over recent years there has been a trend towards developing high-quality assessments to assess a doctor's performance in the workplace. Case-based discussion (CbD) is a form of workplace-based assessment that has the potential to provide feedback to trainees on their performance or management of a specific case. The aim of this study was to explore how CbDs are perceived and implemented in practice amongst a UK cohort of medical trainees.; METHODS: This study involved 78 medical trainees at a UK hospital completing a questionnaire rating their last CbD experience, including the duration spent receiving feedback, whether it was pre-planned or adhoc and how they responded to the feedback received. Focus groups were conducted involving 12 trainees to discuss common themes on feedback arising from the questionnaire, and thematic analysis was carried out following these discussions.; RESULTS: Only 19percent of assessments were pre-planned and the average duration of assessments was 6-10minutes, with feedback lasting less than 5minutes. A total of 76percent of trainees responded to the feedback they received by completing self-directed learning or by addressing the specific action points arising from the feedback. The focus groups highlighted the barriers to incorporating these assessments into everyday practice, including appreciating the time constraints and the importance of trainer engagement in the assessment process. The aim of this study was to explore how CbDs are perceived and implemented inpractice CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that most trainees appreciate the educational value of CbDs, but more emphasis and training is required in planning these assessments and in providing feedback that is both specific and actionable. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education.

AB BACKGROUND: Health literacy studies indicate that literacy skills are linked to access to information and health outcomes, potentially contributing to health disparities. In the United States, minority and immigrant populations are more likely to have lower literacy skills than are other population groups. The aim of this study is to evaluate web-based health information prepared in Spanish for Hispanic women considering breast reconstruction surgery.; METHODS: A search for the term reconstruccion de seno (translation: breast reconstruction) was conducted using Google. The 10 most easily accessible institutional/academic websites and media/private websites were identified. Each website was assessed for readability, understandability/actionability, suitability, cultural sensitivity, numeracy, and for website content organization and navigation. Two independent raters evaluated understandability/actionability, suitability, and cultural sensitivity.; RESULTS: Readability analysis revealed higher than recommended scores (above ninth grade) for institutional/academic and media/private websites with no significant difference. When comparing institutional/academic and media/private websites, scores were adequate with no differences for understandability (50.6% and 47.1%, respectively; P = 0.53), suitability (50.2% vs 49.7%, respectively; P = 0.92), and cultural sensitivity (P = 0.31), whereas actionability scores were low at 18% and 14%, respectively (P = 0.67). In terms of numeracy analysis, most websites were in the less complex area of the hierarchy matrix.; CONCLUSIONS: Available breast reconstruction online resources for the Spanish-speaking population are rated too high for readability. Suitability, understandability, and cultural sensitivity scores are adequate; however, actionability scores are low, indicating potential areas for improvement. These findings demonstrate an opportunity to correct disparities in the literature on breast reconstruction for the Spanish-speaking population.

AB BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD)-structural abnormalities of the heart that arise during embryonic development-is the most common inborn malformation, affecting ≤1% of the population. However, currently, only a minority of cases can be explained by genetic abnormalities. The goal of this study was to identify disease-causal genetic variants in 30 families affected by CHD.; METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed with the DNA of multiple family members. We utilized a 2-tiered whole-exome variant screening and interpretation procedure. First, we manually curated a high-confidence list of 90 genes known to cause CHD in humans, identified predicted damaging variants in genes on this list, and rated their pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines.; RESULTS: In 3 families (10%), we found pathogenic variants in known CHD genes TBX5, TFAP2B, and PTPN11, explaining the cardiac lesions. Second, exomes were comprehensively analyzed to identify additional predicted damaging variants that segregate with disease in CHD candidate genes. In 10 additional families (33%), likely disease-causal variants were uncovered in PBX1, CNOT1, ZFP36L2, TEK, USP34, UPF2, KDM5A, KMT2C, TIE1, TEAD2, and FLT4.; CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of CHD could be explained using our high-confidence CHD gene list for variant filtering in a subset of cases. Furthermore, our unbiased screening procedure of family exomes implicates additional genes and variants in the pathogenesis of CHD, which suggest themselves for functional validation. This 2-tiered approach provides a means of (1) identifying clinically actionable variants and (2) identifying additional disease-causal genes, both of which are essential for improving the molecular diagnosis of CHD. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB Purpose: We sought to investigate the clinical response to MET inhibition in patients diagnosed with structural MET alterations and to characterize their functional relevance in cellular models.Experimental Design: Patients were selected for treatment with crizotinib upon results of hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing. To confirm the clinical observations, we analyzed cellular models that express these MET kinase alterations.Results: Three individual patients were identified to harbor alterations within the MET receptor. Two patients showed genomic rearrangements, leading to a gene fusion of KIF5B or STARD3NL and MET One patient diagnosed with an EML4-ALK rearrangement developed a MET kinase domain duplication as a resistance mechanism to ceritinib. All 3 patients showed a partial response to crizotinib that effectively inhibits MET and ALK among other kinases. The results were further confirmed using orthogonal cellular models.Conclusions: Crizotinib leads to a clinical response in patients with MET rearrangements. Our functional analyses together with the clinical data suggest that these structural alterations may represent actionable targets in lung cancer patients.

AB Purpose: To perform real-time whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to identify predictive mutational and transcriptional features for better treatment selection.Experimental Design: Patients with advanced PDAC were prospectively recruited prior to first-line combination chemotherapy. Fresh tumor tissue was acquired by image-guided percutaneous core biopsy for WGS and RNASeq. Laser capture microdissection was performed for all cases. Primary endpoint was feasibility to report WGS results prior to first disease assessment CT scan at 8 weeks. The main secondary endpoint was discovery of patient subsets with predictive mutational and transcriptional signatures.Results: Sixty-three patients underwent a tumor biopsy between December 2015 and June 2017. WGS and RNASeq were successful in 62 (98%) and 60 (95%), respectively. Genomic results were reported at a median of 35 days (range, 19-52 days) from biopsy, meeting the primary feasibility endpoint. Objective responses to first-line chemotherapy were significantly better in patients with the classical PDAC RNA subtype compared with those with the basal-like subtype (P = 0.004). The best progression-free survival was observed in those with classical subtype treated with m-FOLFIRINOX. GATA6 expression in tumor measured by RNA in situ hybridization was found to be a robust surrogate biomarker for differentiating classical and basal-like PDAC subtypes. Potentially actionable genetic alterations were found in 30% of patients.Conclusions: Prospective genomic profiling of advanced PDAC is feasible, and our early data indicate that chemotherapy response differs among patients with different genomic/transcriptomic subtypes.

AB Background: Soft tissue and bone sarcoma represent a broad spectrum of different pathology and genetic variance. Current chemotherapy regimens are derived from randomised trials and represent empirical treatment. Chemosensitivity testing and whole exome sequencing (WES) may offer personalized chemotherapy treatment based on genetic mutations.; Methods: A pilot, prospective, non-randomised control experimental study was conducted. Twelve patients with metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma that had failed first line chemotherapy treatment were enrolled for this study. Human tissue taken at surgical biopsy under general anaesthetic was divided between two arms of the trial. Subsections of the tumour were used for WES and the remainder was implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice (PDX). Results of WES were analysed using a bioinformatics pipeline to identify mutations conferring susceptibility to kinase inhibitors and common chemotherapeutic agents. PDX models exhibiting successful growth underwent WES of the tumour and subsequent chemosensitivity testing.; Results: WES was successful in all 12 patients, with successful establishment PDX tumours models in seven patients. WES identified potential actionable therapeutics in all patients. Significant variation in predicted therapeutics was demonstrated between three PDX samples and their matched tumour samples.; Conclusion: Analysis of WES of fresh tumour specimens via a bioinformatics pipeline may identify potential actionable chemotherapy agents. Further research into this field may lead to the development of personalized cancer therapy for sarcoma.

AB Approximately 5-10% of all pancreatic cancer patients carry a predisposing mutation in a known susceptibility gene. Since >90% of patients present with late stage disease, it is crucial to identify high risk individuals who may be amenable to early detection or other prevention. To explore the spectrum of hereditary pancreatic cancer susceptibility, we evaluated germline DNA from pancreatic cancer participants (n=53) from a large hereditary cancer registry. For those without a known predisposition mutation gene (n=49), germline next generation sequencing was completed using targeted capture for 706 candidate genes. We identified 16 of 53 participants (30%) with a pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variant that may be related to their hereditary pancreatic cancer predisposition; seven had mutations in genes associated with well-known cancer syndromes (13%) [ATM (2), BRCA2 (3), MSH2 (1), MSH6 (1)]. Many had mutations in Fanconi anemia complex genes [BRCA2 (3 participants), FANCF, FANCM]. Eight participants had rare protein truncating variants of uncertain significance with no other P or LP variants. Earlier age of pancreatic cancer diagnosis (57.5 vs 64.8years) was indicative of possessing a P or LP variant, as was cancer family history (p values <0.0001). Our multigene panel approach for identifying known cancer predisposing genetic susceptibility in those at risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer may have direct applicability to clinical practice in cases with mutations in actionable genes. Future pancreatic cancer predisposition studies should include evaluation of the Fanconi anemia genes.

AB BACKGROUND: A comprehensive understanding of cancer has been furthered with technological improvements and decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the complexity of interpreting genomic data is hindering the implementation of high-throughput technologies in the clinical context: increasing evidence on gene-drug interactions complicates the task of assigning clinical significance to genomic variants.; METHODS: Here we present a method that automatically matches patient-specific genomic alterations to treatment options. The method relies entirely on public knowledge of somatic variants with predictive evidence on drug response. The output report is aimed at supporting clinicians in the task of finding the clinical meaning of genomic variants. We applied the method to 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) cohorts and 2) 11 patients from the NCT MASTER trial whose treatment discussions included information on their genomic profiles.; RESULTS: Our reporting strategy showed a substantial number of patients with actionable variants in the analyses of TCGA and GENIE samples. Notably, it was able to reproduce experts' treatment suggestions in a retrospective study of 11 patients from the NCT MASTER trial. Our results establish a proof of concept for comprehensive, evidence-based reports as a supporting tool for discussing treatment options in tumor boards.; CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a standardized method to report actionable somatic variants will smooth the incorporation of NGS in the clinical context.

AB BACKGROUND: A comprehensive and context-specific approach to monitoring financial protection can provide valuable evidence on progress towards universal health coverage.; OBJECTIVES: This article systematically reviews the literature on financial protection in Europe to identify trends across countries and over time. It also maps the availability of data for regular monitoring in 53 countries.; METHODS: Two people independently searched for studies using a standard strategy. Results were extracted from 54 publications and studies analysed in terms of geographical focus, data sources, methods and depth of analysis.; RESULTS: Financial protection varies across countries in Europe; substantial changes over time have mainly taken place in the east of the region. Although the data required for regular monitoring are widely available, the literature presents major gaps in geographical scope - most studies focus on middle-income countries; it is not up to date - the latest year of data analysed is 2011; and cross-national comparison is only possible for a handful of countries due to variation in data sources and methods. The literature is also limited in depth. Very few studies go beyond analysing how many people incur catastrophic or impoverishing out-of-pocket payments. Only a small minority analyse who is most likely to experience financial hardship and what drives lack of financial protection.; CONCLUSIONS: The literature provides little actionable evidence on financial protection in Europe.

AB Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death among both men and women in the United States, where non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85% of lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the major histologic subtype. The presence of actionable mutations prompts the use of therapies designed to specifically address the deleterious effects of those cancer-driving mutations; these therapies have already shown promise in cases carrying those actionable mutations (30%). Innovative therapeutic approaches are needed for the treatment of 70% of patients suffering from lung ADC. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells specific against cancer/testis (CT) Ags, whose protein expression is restricted to the gonads (testis and ovary) and cancerous cells, is an excellent alternative. In this study, we report the isolation of HLA-A*02:01/CT37 peptide-specific alpha and beta TCR chains from a CD8+ T cell clone obtained from a patient suffering from lung ADC. We also report the development of an innovative CD3zeta construct. With those TCR chains and the engineered (modified) CD3zeta chain, we produced a construct that when transduced into CD8+ T cells is capable of redirecting transduced CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity and IFN-gamma secretion against peptide-pulsed autologous cells and HLA-A*02:01-positive and CT37-expressing lung ADC cell lines. Our findings will launch the development of innovative adoptive transfer immunotherapies for the treatment of lung ADC, targeting the most prevalent HLA molecules and CT37 peptides restricted by these molecules.

AB INTRODUCTION: We performed a meta-analysis to synthesise current evidence on amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) burden and presumed preferential occipital distribution in sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).; METHODS: In a PubMed systematic search, we identified case-control studies with extractable data on global and occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake in symptomatic patients with CAA (per Boston criteria) versus control groups (healthy participants or patients with non-CAA deep intracerebral haemorrhage) and patients with Alzheimer's disease. To circumvent PET studies' methodological variation, we generated and used 'fold change', that is, ratio of mean amyloid uptake (global and occipital-to-global) of CAA relative to comparison groups. Amyloid-PET uptake biomarker performance was then quantified by random-effects meta-analysis on the ratios of the means. A ratio >1 indicates that amyloid-PET uptake (global or occipital/global) is higher in CAA than comparison groups, and a ratio <1 indicates the reverse.; RESULTS: Seven studies, including 106 patients with CAA (>90% with probable CAA) and 138 controls (96 healthy elderly, 42 deep intracerebral haemorrhage controls) and 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease, were included. Global amyloid-PET ratio between patients with CAA and controls was above 1, with an average effect size of 1.18 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.28; p<0.0001). Occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio did not differ between patients with CAA versus patients with deep intracerebral haemorrhage or healthy controls. By contrast, occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio was above 1 in patients with CAA versus those with Alzheimer's disease, with an average ratio of 1.10 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; p=0.009) and high statistical heterogeneity.; CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides exploratory actionable data on the overall effect sizes and strength of amyloid-PET burden and distribution in patients with CAA, useful for future larger studies. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB OBJECTIVE: Interest in studying mechanisms of behavior change (MOBCs) in substance use disorder (SUD) treatments has grown considerably in the past two decades. Much of this work has focused on identifying which variables statistically mediate the effect of SUD treatments on clinical outcomes. However, a fuller conceptualization of MOBCs will require greater understanding of questions that extend beyond traditional mediation analysis, including better understanding of when MOBCs change during treatment, when they are most critical to aiding the initiation or maintenance of change, and how MOBCs themselves arise as a function of treatment processes.; METHOD: In the present study, we review why these MOBC-related questions are often minimally addressed in empirical research and provide examples of data analytic methods that may address these issues. We highlight several recent studies that have used such methods and discuss how these methods can provide unique theoretical insights and actionable clinical information.; RESULTS: Several statistical approaches can enhance the field's understanding of the timing and development of MOBCs, including growth-curve modeling, time-varying effect modeling, moderated mediation analysis, dynamic systems modeling, and simulation methods.; CONCLUSIONS: Adopting greater diversity in methods for modeling MOBCs will help researchers better understand the timing and development of key change variables and will expand the theoretical precision and clinical impact of MOBC research. Advances in research design, measurement, and technology are key to supporting these advances.

AB Objective: Problem list data is a driving force for many beneficial clinical tools, yet these data remain underutilized. We performed a systematic literature review, pulling insights from previous research, aggregating insights into themes, and distilling themes into actionable advice. We sought to learn what changes we could make to existing applications, to the clinical workflow, and to clinicians' perceptions that would improve problem list utilization and increase the prevalence of problems data in the electronic medical record.; Materials and Methods: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to systematically curate a corpus of pertinent articles. We performed a thematic analysis, looking for interesting excerpts and ideas. By aggregating excerpts from many authors, we gained broader, more inclusive insights into what makes a good problem list and what factors are conducive to its success.; Results: Analysis led to a list of 7 benefits of using the problem list, 15 aspects critical to problem list success, and knowledge to help inform policy development, such as consensus on what belongs on the problem list, who should maintain the problem list, and when.; Conclusions: A list of suggestions is made on ways in which the problem list can be improved to increase utilization by clinicians. There is also a need for standard measurements of the problem list, so that lists can be measured, compared, and discussed with rigor and a common vocabulary.

AB Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is an understudied malignancy with distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular features that distinguish it from the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Mounting evidence suggests that estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ER+) ILC has a poor response to Tamoxifen (TAM), but the mechanistic drivers of this are undefined. In the current work, we comprehensively characterize the SUM44/LCCTam ILC cell model system through integrated analysis of gene expression, copy number, and mutation, with the goal of identifying actionable alterations relevant to clinical ILC that can be co-targeted along with ER to improve treatment outcomes. We show that TAM has several distinct effects on the transcriptome of LCCTam cells, that this resistant cell model has acquired copy number alterations and mutations that impinge on MAPK and metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM/mGluR) signaling networks, and that pharmacological inhibition of either improves or restores the growth-inhibitory actions of endocrine therapy.

AB Considerable evidence suggests that autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) share a common molecular aetiology, despite their unique clinical diagnostic criteria. The aim of this study was therefore to determine and characterise the common and unique molecular architecture of ASD, SCZ, BD and OCD. Gene lists were obtained from previously published studies for ASD, BD, SCZ and for OCD. Genes identified to be common to all disorders, or unique to one specific disorder, were included for enrichment analyses using the web-server tool Enrichr. Ten genes were identified to be commonly associated with the aetiology of ASD, SCZ, BD and OCD. Enrichment analyses determined that these genes are predominantly involved in the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways, the voltage-gated calcium ion channel gene network, folate metabolism, regulation of the hippo signaling pathway, and the regulation of gene silencing and expression. In addition to well-characterised and previously described pathways, regulation of the hippo signaling pathway was commonly associated with ASD, SCZ, BD and OCD, implicating neural development and neuronal maintenance as key in neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, a large number of previously associated genes were shown to be disorder-specific. And unique disorder-specific pathways and biological processes were presented for ASD, BD, SCZ and OCD aetiology. Considering the current global incidence and prevalence rates of mental health disorders, focus should be placed on cross-disorder commonalities in order to realise actionable and translatable results to combat mental health disorders.

However, current approaches for molecular characterization are primarily tissue based, necessitating serial biopsies to understand changes over time and are limited by the challenges inherent to extracting genomic material from predominantly bone metastases. Therefore, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based assay was developed to determine gene expression across a panel of clinically relevant and potentially actionable prostate cancer-related genes. CTCs were isolated from the whole blood of mCRPC patients (n = 41) and multiplex qPCR was performed to evaluate expression of prostate cancer-related target genes (n = 78). A large fraction of patients (27/41, 66%) had detectable CTCs. Increased androgen receptor (AR) expression (70% of samples) and evidence of Wnt signaling (67% of samples) were observed. The TMPRSS2:ERG fusion was expressed in 41% of samples, and the aggressive prostate cancer-associated long noncoding RNA SChLAP1 was upregulated in 70%. WNT5a [HR 3.62, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.63-8.05, P = 0.002], AURKA (HR 5.56, 95% CI, 1.79-17.20, P = 0.003), and BMP7 (HR 3.86, 95% CI, 1.60-9.32, P = 0.003) were independently predictive of overall survival (FDR < 10%) after adjusting for a panel of previously established prognostic variables in mCRPC (Halabi nomogram). A model including Halabi, WNT5a, and AURKA expression, termed the miCTC score, outperformed the Halabi nomogram alone (AUC = 0.89 vs. AUC = 0.70). Understanding the molecular landscape of CTCs has utility in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with aggressive prostate cancer and provides an additional tool in the arsenal of precision-based therapeutic approaches in oncology.Implications: Analysis of CTC gene expression reveals a clinically prognostic "liquid biopsy" signature in patients with metastatic castrate-resistance prostate cancer.

AB Theories and models are not equivalent. I argue that an orientation towards models as a primary carrier of nursing knowledge overcomes many ongoing challenges in philosophy of nursing science, including the theory-practice divide and the paradoxical pursuit of predictive theories in a discipline that is defined by process and a commitment to the non-reducibility of the health/care experience. Scientific models describe and explain the dynamics of specific phenomenon. This is distinct from theory, which is traditionally defined as propositions that explain and/or predict the world. The philosophical case has been made against theoretical universalism, showing that a theory can be true in its domain, but that no domain is universal. Subsequently, philosophers focused on scientific models argued that they do the work of defining the boundary conditions-the domain(s)-of a theory. Further analysis has shown the ways models can be constructed and function independent of theory, meaning models can comprise distinct, autonomous "carriers of scientific knowledge." Models are viewed as representations of the active dynamics, or mechanisms, of a phenomenon. Mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes. Importantly, mechanisms are by definition not static: change may alter the mechanism and thereby alter or create entirely new phenomena. Orienting away from theory, and towards models, focuses scholarly activity on dynamics and change. This makes models arguably critical to nursing science, enabling the production of actionable knowledge about the dynamics of process and change in health/care. I briefly explore the implications for nursing-and health/care-knowledge and practice. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is among the most frequently mutated pathways in human cancer. Approximately 50% of melanoma patients possess a druggable hotspot V600E/K mutation in the BRAF protein kinase. FDA-approved combination therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors are available that provide survival benefits to patients with a BRAF V600 mutation. Non-V600 BRAF mutants are found in many cancers, and are more prevalent than V600 mutations in certain tumor types. For example, between 50-80% of BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and 22-30% in colorectal cancer encode for non-V600 mutants. As next generation sequencing becomes increasingly used in clinical practice, oncologists are frequently identifying non-V600 BRAF mutations in their patient's tumors, but are uncertain of viable therapeutic options that could be employed for optimal treatment. From recent studies, a new classification system is emerging for BRAF mutations based on biochemical and signaling mechanisms associated with these mutants. Class I BRAF mutations affect amino acid V600 and signal as RAS-independent active monomers, class II mutations function as RAS-independent activated dimers, and class III mutations are kinase impaired but increase signaling through the MAPK pathway due to enhanced RAS binding and subsequent CRAF activation. These distinct classes of BRAF mutations predict response to targeted therapies and have important implications for future drug development. Herein, we discuss pre-clinical and clinical findings that may lead to improved treatments for all classes of BRAF mutant cancers.

AB Rapidly advancing genomic sequencing technologies are changing all areas of cancer, from diagnosis to surveillance, and prognostication to treatment. The role of genomic testing in melanoma is expanding, and multiple genomically based tests are available, including somatic tumor sequencing for actionable genetic alterations and tumor mutational burden, prognostic gene expression profiling from tumor tissue, and germline genetic testing from blood. The available testing options have varying levels of supporting data, from robust to preliminary. Here we summarize the available genomic and genetic tests for melanoma, and the level of evidence supporting each of these. We also discuss the current impact of genomic sequencing on the management of melanoma, as well as roles it may play in the near future.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the interrater reliability (IRR) and usability of the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) and the relationship between PEMAT scores and readability levels.; METHODS: One hundred ten materials (80 print, 30 audiovisual) were evaluated, each by two raters, using the PEMAT. IRR was calculated using Gwet's AC1 and summarized across items in each PEMAT domain (understandability and actionability) and by material type. A survey was conducted to solicit raters' experience using the PEMAT. Readability of each material was assessed using the SMOG Index.; RESULTS: The median IRR was 0.92 for understandability and 0.93 for actionability across all relevant items, indicating good IRR. Eight PEMAT items had Gwet's AC1 values less than 0.81. PEMAT and SMOG Index scores were inversely correlated, with a Spearman's rho of -0.20 (p=0.081) for understandability and -0.15 (p=0.194) for actionability. While 92% of raters agreed the PEMAT was easy to use, survey results suggested specific items for clarification.; CONCLUSION: While the PEMAT demonstrates moderate to excellent IRR overall, amendments to items with lower IRR may increase the usefulness of the tool.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The PEMAT is a useful supplement to reading level alone in the assessment of educational materials.

AB INTRODUCTION: Detection and monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tool in cancer patient care. A growing number of gene targets have been identified as diagnostic or actionable, requiring the development of reliable technology that provides analysis of multiple genes in parallel. We have developed the InVision liquid biopsy platform which utilizes enhanced TAm-Seq (eTAm-Seq) technology, an amplicon-based next generation sequencing method for the identification of clinically-relevant somatic alterations at low frequency in ctDNA across a panel of 35 cancer-related genes.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present analytical validation of the eTAm-Seq technology across two laboratories to determine the reproducibility of mutation identification. We assess the quantitative performance of eTAm-Seq technology for analysis of single nucleotide variants in clinically-relevant genes as compared to digital PCR (dPCR), using both established DNA standards and novel full-process control material.; RESULTS: The assay detected mutant alleles down to 0.02% AF, with high per-base specificity of 99.9997%. Across two laboratories, analysis of samples with optimal amount of DNA detected 94% mutations at 0.25%-0.33% allele fraction (AF), with 90% of mutations detected for samples with lower amounts of input DNA.; CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that eTAm-Seq technology is a robust and reproducible technology for the identification and quantification of somatic mutations in circulating tumor DNA, and support its use in clinical applications for precision medicine.

AB Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis is being incorporated into cancer care; notably in profiling patients to guide treatment decisions. Responses to targeted therapies have been observed in patients with actionable mutations detected in plasma DNA at variant allele fractions (VAFs) below 0.5%. Highly sensitive methods are therefore required for optimal clinical use. To enable objective assessment of assay performance, detailed analytical validation is required. We developed the InVisionFirst assay, an assay based on enhanced tagged amplicon sequencing (eTAm-Seq) technology to profile 36 genes commonly mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancer types for actionable genomic alterations in cell-free DNA. The assay has been developed to detect point mutations, indels, amplifications and gene fusions that commonly occur in NSCLC. For analytical validation, two 10mL blood tubes were collected from NSCLC patients and healthy volunteer donors. In addition, contrived samples were used to represent a wide spectrum of genetic aberrations and VAFs. Samples were analyzed by multiple operators, at different times and using different reagent Lots. Results were compared with digital PCR (dPCR). The InVisionFirst assay demonstrated an excellent limit of detection, with 99.48% sensitivity for SNVs present at VAF range 0.25%-0.33%, 92.46% sensitivity for indels at 0.25% VAF and a high rate of detection at lower frequencies while retaining high specificity (99.9997% per base). The assay also detected ALK and ROS1 gene fusions, and DNA amplifications in ERBB2, FGFR1, MET and EGFR with high sensitivity and specificity. Comparison between the InVisionFirst assay and dPCR in a series of cancer patients showed high concordance. This analytical validation demonstrated that the InVisionFirst assay is highly sensitive, specific and robust, and meets analytical requirements for clinical applications.

AB The treatment and prognosis of metastatic melanoma has changed substantially since the advent of novel immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), agents that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Despite the success of these agents, clinically actionable biomarkers to aid patient and regimen selection are lacking. Herein, we summarize and review the evidence for candidate biomarkers of response to ICIs in melanoma. Many of these candidates can be examined as parts of a known molecular pathway of immune response, while others are clinical in nature. Due to the ability of ICIs to illicit dramatic and durable responses, well-validated biomarkers that can be effectively implemented in the clinic will require strong negative predictive values that do not limit patients with who may benefit from ICI therapy.

AB OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the benefits of adding high-fidelity simulation to a teenage trauma prevention program to decrease recidivism rates and encourage teens to discuss actionable steps toward safe driving.; METHODS: A simulated pediatric trauma scenario was integrated into an established trauma prevention program. Participants were recruited because they were court-ordered to attend this program after misdemeanor convictions for moving violations. The teenage participants viewed this simulation from the emergency medical services (EMS) handoff to complete trauma care. Participants completed a postsimulation knowledge assessment and care evaluation, which included narrative data about the experience. Qualitative analysis of color-coded responses identified common themes and experiences in participants' answers. Court records were reviewed 6years after course completion to determine short- and long-term recidivism rates, which were then compared to our program's historical rate.; RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four students aged 16-20years participated over a 2-year study period. Narrative responses included general reflection, impressions, and thoughts about what they might change as a result of the course. Participants reported that they would decrease speed (30%), wear seat belts (15%), decrease cell phone use (11%), and increase caution (28%). The recidivism rate was 55% within 6years. At 6months it was 8.4%, at 1year it was 20%, and it increased approximately 5-8% per year after the first year. Compared with our programs, for historical 6-month and 2-year recidivism rates, no significant difference was seen with or without simulation.; CONCLUSIONS: Adding simulation is well received by participants and leads to positive reflections regarding changes in risk-taking behaviors but resulted in no changes to the high recidivism rates This may be due to the often ineffectiveness of fear appeals.

AB Huntington's disease (HD) is a single-gene inheritable neurodegenerative disorder with an associated complex molecular pathogenic profile that renders it the most 'curable incurable' brain disorder. Continuous effort in the field has contributed to the recent discovery of novel potential pathogenic mechanisms. Findings in preclinical models of the disease as well as in human post-mortem brains from affected patients demonstrate that alteration of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) axis may represent a possible key player in the pathogenesis of the disease and may act as a potential actionable drug target for the development of more targeted and effective therapeutic approaches. The relevance of the path of this new 'therapeutic route' is underscored by the fact that some drugs targeting the S1P axis are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of other brain disorders.

AB Sepsis is an often fatal condition that arises when the immune response to an infection causes widespread systemic organ injury. A critical unmet need in combating sepsis is the lack of accurate early biomarkers that produce actionable results in busy clinical settings. Here, we report the development of a point-of-care platform for rapid sepsis detection. Termed IBS (integrated biosensor for sepsis), our approach leverages (i) the pathophysiological role of cytokine interleukin-3 (IL-3) in early sepsis and (ii) a hybrid magneto-electrochemical sensor for IL-3 detection. The developed platform produces test results within 1 h from native blood samples and detects IL-3 at a sensitivity of <10 pg/mL; this performance is >5-times faster and >10-times more sensitive than conventional enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays, the current gold standard. Using clinical samples, we show that elevated plasma IL-3 levels are associated with high organ failure rate and thus greater risk of mortality, confirming the potential of IL-3 as a sepsis diagnostic biomarker. With further system development ( e. g., full automation, data security measures) and rigorous validation studies, the compact and fast IBS could be a practical clinical tool for timely diagnosis and proactive treatment of sepsis.

AB BACKGROUND: Given the complex and progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a precision medicine approach for diagnosis and treatment requires the identification of patient subgroups with biomedically distinct and actionable phenotype definitions.; METHODS: Longitudinal patient-level data for 1160AD patients receiving placebo or no treatment with a follow-up of up to 18months were extracted from an integrated clinical trials dataset. We used latent class mixed modelling (LCMM) to identify patient subgroups demonstrating distinct patterns of change over time in disease severity, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score. The optimal number of subgroups (classes) was selected by the model which had the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion. Other patient-level variables were used to define these subgroups' distinguishing characteristics and to investigate the interactions between patient characteristics and patterns of disease progression.; RESULTS: The LCMM resulted in three distinct subgroups of patients, with 10.3% in Class 1, 76.5% in Class 2 and 13.2% in Class 3. While all classes demonstrated some degree of cognitive decline, each demonstrated a different pattern of change in cognitive scores, potentially reflecting different subtypes of AD patients. Class 1 represents rapid decliners with a steep decline in cognition over time, and who tended to be younger and better educated. Class 2 represents slow decliners, while Class 3 represents severely impaired slow decliners: patients with a similar rate of decline to Class 2 but with worse baseline cognitive scores. Class 2 demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of statins use; Class 3 showed lower levels of blood monocytes and serum calcium, and higher blood glucose levels.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results, 'learned' from clinical data, indicate the existence of at least three subgroups of Alzheimer's patients, each demonstrating a different trajectory of disease progression. This hypothesis-generating approach has detected distinct AD subgroups that may prove to be discrete endophenotypes linked to specific aetiologies. These findings could enable stratification within a clinical trial or study context, which may help identify new targets for intervention and guide better care.

AB BACKGROUND: The introduction of targeted treatments for subsets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has highlighted the importance of accurate molecular diagnosis to determine if an actionable genetic alteration is present. Few data are available for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) on mutation rates, testing rates, and compliance with testing guidelines.; METHODS: A questionnaire about molecular testing and NSCLC management was distributed to relevant specialists in nine CEE countries, and pathologists were asked to provide the results of EGFR and ALK testing over a 1-year period.; RESULTS: A very high proportion of lung cancer cases are confirmed histologically/cytologically (75-100%), and molecular testing of NSCLC samples has been established in all evaluated CEE countries in 2014. Most countries follow national or international guidelines on which patients to test for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements. In most centers at that time, testing was undertaken on request of the clinician rather than on the preferred reflex basis. Immunohistochemistry, followed by fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmation of positive cases, has been widely adopted for ALK testing in the region. Limited reimbursement is a significant barrier to molecular testing in the region and a disincentive to reflex testing. Multidisciplinary tumor boards are established in most of the countries and centers, with 75-100% of cases being discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board at specialized centers.; CONCLUSIONS: Molecular testing is established throughout the CEE region, but improved and unbiased reimbursement remains a major challenge for the future. Increasing the number of patients reviewed by multidisciplinary boards outside of major centers and access to targeted therapy based on the result of molecular testing are other major challenges.

AB The functional impact of the vast majority of cancer somatic mutations remains unknown, representing a critical knowledge gap for implementing precision oncology. Here, we report the development of a moderate-throughput functional genomic platform consisting of efficient mutant generation, sensitive viability assays using two growth factor-dependent cell models, and functional proteomic profiling of signaling effects for select aberrations. We apply the platform to annotate >1,000 genomic aberrations, including gene amplifications, point mutations, indels, and gene fusions, potentially doubling the number of driver mutations characterized in clinically actionable genes. Further, the platform is sufficiently sensitive to identify weak drivers. Our data are accessible through a user-friendly, public data portal. Our study will facilitate biomarker discovery, prediction algorithm improvement, and drug development. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Tamoxifen remains an important hormonal therapy for ER-positive breast cancer; however, development of resistance is a major obstacle in clinics. Here, we aimed to identify novel mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance and provide actionable drug targets overcoming resistance.Experimental Design: Whole-transcriptome sequencing, downstream pathway analysis, and drug repositioning approaches were used to identify novel modulators [here: phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D)] of tamoxifen resistance. Clinical data involving tamoxifen-treated patients with ER-positive breast cancer were used to assess the impact of PDE4D in tamoxifen resistance. Tamoxifen sensitization role of PDE4D was tested in vitro and in vivo Cytobiology, biochemistry, and functional genomics tools were used to elucidate the mechanisms of PDE4D-mediated tamoxifen resistance.Results: PDE4D, which hydrolyzes cyclic AMP (cAMP), was significantly overexpressed in both MCF-7 and T47D tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cells. Higher PDE4D expression predicted worse survival in tamoxifen-treated patients with breast cancer (n = 469, P = 0.0036 for DMFS; n = 561, P = 0.0229 for RFS) and remained an independent prognostic factor for RFS in multivariate analysis (n = 132, P = 0.049). Inhibition of PDE4D by either siRNAs or pharmacologic inhibitors (dipyridamole and Gebr-7b) restored tamoxifen sensitivity. Sensitization to tamoxifen is achieved via cAMP-mediated induction of unfolded protein response/ER stress pathway leading to activation of p38/JNK signaling and apoptosis. Remarkably, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) was predicted to be a tamoxifen sensitizer using a drug repositioning approach and was shown to reverse resistance by targeting PDE4D/cAMP/ER stress axis. Finally, combining PDE4D inhibitors and tamoxifen suppressed tumor growth better than individual groups in vivoConclusions: PDE4D plays a pivotal role in acquired tamoxifen resistance via blocking cAMP/ER stress/p38-JNK signaling and apoptosis.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights recent advances in the investigation of genetic factors for antipsychotic response and side effects.; RECENT FINDINGS: Antipsychotics prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms are variable in efficacy and propensity for causing side effects. The major side effects include tardive dyskinesia, antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), and clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA). Several promising associations of polymorphisms in genes including HSPG2, CNR1, and DPP6 with tardive dyskinesia have been reported. In particular, a functional genetic polymorphism in SLC18A2, which is a target of recently approved tardive dyskinesia medication valbenazine, was associated with tardive dyskinesia. Similarly, several consistent findings primarily from genes modulating energy homeostasis have also been reported (e.g. MC4R, HTR2C). CIA has been consistently associated with polymorphisms in the HLA genes (HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B). The association findings between glutamate system genes and antipsychotic response require additional replications.; SUMMARY: The findings to date are promising and provide us a better understanding of the development of side effects and response to antipsychotics. However, more comprehensive investigations in large, well characterized samples will bring us closer to clinically actionable findings.

AB Aims: Cohorts of millions of people's health records, whole genome sequencing, imaging, sensor, societal and publicly available data present a rapidly expanding digital trace of health. We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research.; Methods and results: We sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium. We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills. Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency. In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.g. linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.g. human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.g. DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics. In late translational research we identified exemplars including: learning health systems with outcome trials integrated into clinical care; citizen driven health with 24/7 multi-parameter patient monitoring to improve outcomes and population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health.; Conclusion: High volumes of inherently diverse ('big') EHR data are beginning to disrupt the nature of cardiovascular research and care. Such big data have the potential to improve our understanding of disease causation and classification relevant for early translation and to contribute actionable analytics to improve health and healthcare.

AB INTRODUCTION: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are a heterogeneous group of cancers, characterized by low incidence but poor prognosis. Even after complete surgical resection for early stage, relapse is frequent and the lack of effective treatments contributes to the dismal prognosis. To date, the only standard treatment in first-line is cisplatin/gemcitabine combination, whereas no standard in 2nd-line has been defined. Hence, the current goal is to better understand the biology of BTCs, discovering new treatment methods and improving clinical outcomes. Areas covered: The development of next-generation-sequencing has unveiled the picture of the molecular signatures characterizing BTCs, leading to the identification of actionable mutations in biomarker-driven clinical trials. In this review we will cover the genetic landscape of BTC, focusing on the efficacy of existing treatments. Furthermore, we will discuss emerging molecular targets and evaluate the findings of pre-clinical studies. Finally, the encouraging results of clinical trials involving targeted therapies or immunotherapy will be reviewed. Expert opinion: FGFR fusion rearrangements and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are the most promising targeted treatments under evaluation. In addition, innovative trial design will allow to offer a chance for tailored medicine to infrequent subgroups of BTCs patients based on their molecular features rather than their histology.

AB The importance of epigenetic dysregulation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathophysiology has become increasingly apparent in recent years. Epigenetic regulators, including readers, writers, and erasers, are recurrently dysregulated by way of chromosomal translocations, somatic mutations, or genomic amplification in AML and many of these alterations are directly implicated in AML pathogenesis. Mutations in epigenetic regulators are often discovered in founder clones and persist after therapy, indicating that they may contribute to a premalignant state poised for the acquisition of cooperating mutations and frank malignancy. Apart from the proto-oncogenic impact of these mutations, the AML epigenome is also shaped by other epigenetic factors that are not mutated but co-opted by AML oncogenes, presenting with actionable vulnerabilities in this disease. Targeting the AML epigenome might also be important for eradicating AML leukemia stem cells, which can be critical for disease maintenance and resistance to therapy. In this review, we describe the importance of epigenetic regulators in AML. We also summarize evidence implicating specific epigenetic regulators in AML pathobiology and discuss emerging epigenome-based therapies for the treatment of AML in the clinic.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in individuals younger than 50 years is increasing. We sought to ascertain the proportion of young CRC cases associated with genetic predisposition.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of individuals diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50 years, evaluated by the clinical genetics service at a single tertiary care cancer center from 1998 through 2015. We collected data on patient histories, tumor phenotypes, and results of germline DNA sequencing. For subjects with uninformative clinical evaluations, germline DNA samples were (re)sequenced using a research-based next-generation sequencing multigene panel. The primary outcome was identification of a pathogenic germline mutation associated with cancer predisposition.; RESULTS: Of 430 young CRC cases, 111 (26%) had a first-degree relative with CRC. Forty-one of the subjects with CRC (10%) had tumors with histologic evidence for mismatch repair deficiency. Of 315 subjects who underwent clinical germline sequencing, 79 had mutations associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome and 21 had variants of uncertain significance. Fifty-six subjects had pathogenic variants associated with Lynch syndrome (25 with mutations in MSH2, 24 with mutations in MLH1, 5with mutations in MSH6, and 2 with mutations in PMS2) and 10 subjects had pathogenic variants associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. Thirteen subjects had mutations in other cancer-associated genes (8 in MUTYH, 2 in SMAD4, 1 in BRCA1, 1 in TP53, and 1 in CHEK2), all identified through multigene panel tests. Among 117 patients with uninformative clinical evaluations, next-generation sequence analysis using a multigene panel detected actionable germline variants in 6 patients (5%). Only 43 of the 85 subjects with germline mutations associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome (51%) reported a CRC diagnosis in a first-degree relative.; CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 5 individuals diagnosed with CRC at age younger than 50 years carries a germline mutation associated with cancer; nearly half of these do not have clinical histories typically associated with the identified syndrome. Germline testing with multigene cancer panels should be considered for all young patients with CRC. Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Follow-up of tests pending at discharge (TPADs) is poor. We previously demonstrated a twofold increase in awareness of any TPAD by attendings and primary care physicians (PCPs) using an automated email intervention OBJECTIVE: To determine whether automated notification improves documented follow-up for actionable TPADs DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial SUBJECTS: Attendings and PCPs caring for adult patients discharged from general medicine and cardiology services with at least one actionable TPAD between June 2011 and May 2012 INTERVENTION: An automated system that notifies discharging attendings and network PCPs of finalized TPADs by email MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of actionable TPADs with documented action determined by independent physician review of the electronic health record (EHR). Secondary outcomes included documented acknowledgment, 30-day readmissions, and adjusted median days to documented follow-up.; KEY RESULTS: Of the 3378 TPADs sampled, 253 (7.5%) were determined to be actionable by physician review. Of these, 150 (123 patients discharged by 53 attendings) and 103 (90 patients discharged by 44 attendings) were assigned to intervention and usual care groups, respectively, and underwent chart review. The proportion of actionable TPADs with documented action was 60.7 vs. 56.3% (p=0.82) in the intervention vs. usual care groups, similar for documented acknowledgment. The proportion of patients with actionable TPADs readmitted within 30days was 22.8 vs. 31.1% in the intervention vs. usual care groups (p=0.24). The adjusted median days [95% CI] to documented action was 9 [6.2, 11.8] vs. 14 [10.2, 17.8] (p=0.04) in the intervention vs. usual care groups, similar for documented acknowledgment. In sub-group analysis, the intervention had greater impact on documented action for patients with network PCPs compared with usual care (70 vs. 50%, p=0.03).; CONCLUSIONS: Automated notification of actionable TPADs shortened time to action but did not significantly improve documented follow-up, except for network-affiliated patients. The high proportion of actionable TPADs without any documented follow-up (~40%) represents an ongoing safety concern.; CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER: NCT01153451.

AB Objective: Unlocking the data contained within both structured and unstructured components of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to provide a step change in data available for secondary research use, generation of actionable medical insights, hospital management, and trial recruitment. To achieve this, we implemented SemEHR, an open source semantic search and analytics tool for EHRs.; Methods: SemEHR implements a generic information extraction (IE) and retrieval infrastructure by identifying contextualized mentions of a wide range of biomedical concepts within EHRs. Natural language processing annotations are further assembled at the patient level and extended with EHR-specific knowledge to generate a timeline for each patient. The semantic data are serviced via ontology-based search and analytics interfaces.; Results: SemEHR has been deployed at a number of UK hospitals, including the Clinical Record Interactive Search, an anonymized replica of the EHR of the UK South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, one of Europe's largest providers of mental health services. In 2 Clinical Record Interactive Search-based studies, SemEHR achieved 93% (hepatitis C) and 99% (HIV) F-measure results in identifying true positive patients. At King's College Hospital in London, as part of the CogStack program (github.com/cogstack), SemEHR is being used to recruit patients into the UK Department of Health 100000 Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk). The validation study suggests that the tool can validate previously recruited cases and is very fast at searching phenotypes; time for recruitment criteria checking was reduced from days to minutes. Validated on open intensive care EHR data, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, the vital signs extracted by SemEHR can achieve around 97% accuracy.; Conclusion: Results from the multiple case studies demonstrate SemEHR's efficiency: weeks or months of work can be done within hours or minutes in some cases. SemEHR provides a more comprehensive view of patients, bringing in more and unexpected insight compared to study-oriented bespoke IE systems. SemEHR is open source, available at https://github.com/CogStack/SemEHR.

AB Background: One of the effects of oncogenic signaling is metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells to support anabolic growth, opening the way to therapeutic targeting of metabolic pathways.; Methods: We studied NAD biosynthesis in BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-resistant (BiR) melanoma cell lines. Data in cell lines were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in biopsies from 17 patients with metastatic melanoma (MM) before and after the acquisition of resistance to BRAFi. Therapeutic potential of NAD biosynthesis inhibitors was determined by invitro monitoring cell growth and death and in mouse xenograft models. Mice (n=6-10mice/group) were treated with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase inhibitor (NAMPTi), BRAFi, or their combination, and tumor growth and survival were analyzed. All statistical tests were two-sided.; Results: BiR cells had higher NAD levels compared with their BRAFi-sensitive counterparts (P < .001 and P = .001 for M14 and A375, respectively) and with normal melanocytes (P< .001), achieved through transcriptional upregulation of the enzyme NAMPT, which became the master regulator of NAD synthesis. Conversely, treatment with BRAFi or MEK inhibitors decreased NAMPT expression and cellular NAD levels. Robust NAMPT upregulation was documented in tissue biopsies from MM patients after development of resistance to BRAFi (P < .001). Treatment of melanoma cells with NAMPTi depleted NAD and ATP, depolarized mitochondrial membrane, and led to reactive oxygen species production, blocking cells in the G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis. Treatment of BiR xenografts with NAMPTi improved mouse survival (median survival of vehicle-treated mice was 52 days vs 100 days for NAMPTi-treated ones in M14/BiR, while in A375/BiR median survival of vehicle-treated mice was 23.5 days vs 43 days for NAMPTi-treated ones, P < .001).; Conclusions: BiR melanoma cells overexpress NAMPT, which acts as a connecting element between BRAF oncogenic signaling and metabolism, becoming an actionable target for this subset of MM patients. © The Author 2017.

AB There is growing awareness amongst healthcare planners, providers and researchers of the need to make better use of routinely collected health data by translating it into actionable information that improves efficiency of healthcare and patient outcomes. There is also increased acceptance of the importance of real world research that recruits patients representative of primary care populations and evaluates interventions realistically delivered by primary care professionals. The UNLOCK Group is an international collaboration of primary care researchers and practitioners from 15 countries. It has coordinated and shared datasets of diagnostic and prognostic variables for COPD and asthma to answer research questions meaningful to professionals working in primary care over a 6-year period. Over this time the UNLOCK Group has undertaken several studies using data from unselected primary care populations from diverse contexts to evaluate the burden of disease, multiple morbidities, treatment and follow-up. However, practical and structural constraints have hampered the UNLOCK Group's ability to translate research ideas into studies. This study explored the constraints, challenges and successes experienced by the UNLOCK Group and its participants' learning as researchers and primary care practitioners collaborating to answer primary care research questions. The study identified lessons for future studies and collaborations that require data sharing across borders. It also explored specific challenges to fostering the exchange of primary care data in comparison to other datasets such as public health, prescribing or hospital data and mechanisms that may be used to overcome these.

AB Fusion of the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein 4 gene (EML4) is the second most common actionable alteration in non-small-cell lung cancer, with a frequency of 5%. Here, we present a case of an EML4-ALK-positive patient with an atypical in-frame insertion from the LTBP1 gene in the canonical junction of variant 1. The patient was a 39-year-old never-smoker female diagnosed with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. A core biopsy was negative for EGFR and KRAS mutations but positive for ALK immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. When submitted to nCounter, the sample showed a 3'/5' imbalance indicative of an ALK rearrangement, but failed to give a positive signal for any of the variants tested. Finally, a band with a molecular weight higher than expected appeared after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. When Sanger sequencing was performed, the band revealed an atypical EML4-ALK fusion gene with an in-frame 129 bp insertion. A 115 bp segment of the insertion corresponded to an intronic region of LTBP1, a gene located in the short arm of chromosome 2, between ALK and EML4. The patient received crizotinib and showed a good therapeutic response that is still ongoing after 12 months. Our result suggests that short in-frame insertions of other genes in the EML4-ALK junction do not affect the sensitivity of the EML4-ALK fusion protein to crizotinib.

AB Advances in genomics have the potential to revolutionize clinical diagnostics. Here, we examine the microbiome of vitreous (intraocular body fluid) from patients who developed endophthalmitis following cataract surgery or intravitreal injection. Endophthalmitis is an inflammation of the intraocular cavity and can lead to a permanent loss of vision. As controls, we included vitreous from endophthalmitis-negative patients, balanced salt solution used during vitrectomy and DNA extraction blanks. We compared two DNA isolation procedures and found that an ultraclean production of reagents appeared to reduce background DNA in these low microbial biomass samples. We created a curated microbial genome database (>5700 genomes) and designed a metagenomics workflow with filtering steps to reduce DNA sequences originating from: (i) human hosts, (ii) ambiguousness/contaminants in public microbial reference genomes and (iii) the environment. Our metagenomic read classification revealed in nearly all cases the same microorganism that was determined in cultivation- and mass spectrometry-based analyses. For some patients, we identified the sequence type of the microorganism and antibiotic resistance genes through analyses of whole genome sequence (WGS) assemblies of isolates and metagenomic assemblies. Together, we conclude that genomics-based analyses of human ocular body fluid specimens can provide actionable information relevant to infectious disease management.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing in Western countries, including in the area of dermatology. However, Western healthcare providers have not integrated CAM into regular practice owing to a lack of reliable data supporting its use. To encourage high-quality research related to the use of CAM and specifically herbal interventions, the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension criteria on reporting herbal interventions (hCONSORT) were published in 2006.; OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the adherence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating herbal interventions for acne, atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis to the hCONSORT criteria.; METHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was conducted. RCTs published between 2009 and 2014 assessing therapeutic outcomes of plant-based interventions for acne, AD or psoriasis were included. Investigators determined the number of unique hCONSORT criteria satisfied per report. anova was used to examine differences in scores by disease entity.; RESULTS: The vast majority of reviewed studies reported < 50% of information recommended in the hCONSORT criteria. Limitations include the small number of dermatological conditions examined, exclusion of reports based on language and lack of assessment of overall adherence to CONSORT criteria.; CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate lack of adherence to hCONSORT extension criteria. Adherence to hCONSORT guidelines should be encouraged in order to provide high-quality reporting of research on herbal interventions in dermatology. Doing so may ease the integration of CAM into conventional medical practice and provide actionable data to providers. © 2017 British Association of Dermatologists.

AB Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a dominantly inherited disease caused by hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway and characterized by the development of hamartomas and benign tumors, including in the brain. Among the neurological manifestations associated with TSC, the tumor progression of static subependymal nodules (SENs) into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) is one of the major causes of morbidity and shortened life expectancy. To date, mouse modeling has failed in reproducing these 2 lesions. Here we report that simultaneous hyperactivation of mTORC1 and Akt pathways by codeletion of Tsc1 and Pten, selectively in postnatal neural stem cells (pNSCs), is required for the formation of bona fide SENs and SEGAs. Notably, both lesions closely recapitulate the pathognomonic morphological and molecular features of the corresponding human abnormalities. The establishment of long-term expanding pNSC lines from mouse SENs and SEGAs made possible the identification of mTORC2 as one of the mediators conferring tumorigenic potential to SEGA pNSCs. Notably, in spite of concurrent Akt hyperactivation in mouse brain lesions, single mTOR inhibition by rapamycin was sufficient to strongly impair mouse SEGA growth. This study provides evidence that, concomitant with mTORC1 hyperactivation, sustained activation of Akt and mTORC2 in pNSCs is a mandatory step for the induction of SENs and SEGAs, and, at the same time, makes available an unprecedented NSC-based in vivo/in vitro model to be exploited for identifying actionable targets in TSC.

AB INTRODUCTION: Multisource feedback is a questionnaire-based assessment tool that provides physicians with data about workplace behaviors and may combine numeric and narrative (free-text) comments. Little attention has been paid to wording of requests for comments, potentially limiting its utility to support physician performance. This study tested the phrasing of two different sets of questions.; METHODS: Two sets of questions were tested with family physicians, medical and surgical specialists, and their medical colleague and coworker respondents. One set asked respondents to identify one thing the participant physician does well and one thing the physician could target for action. Set 2 questions asked what does the physician do well and what might the physician do to enhance practice. Resulting free-text comments provided by respondents were coded for polarity (positive, neutral, or negative), specificity (precision and detail), actionability (ability to use the feedback to direct future activity), and CanMEDS roles (competencies) and analyzed descriptively.; RESULTS: Data for 222 physicians (111 physicians per set) were analyzed. A total of 1824 comments (8.2/physician) were submitted, with more comments from coworkers than medical colleagues. Set 1 yielded more comments and were more likely to be positive, semi specific, and very actionable than set 2. However, set 2 generated more very specific comments. Comments covered all CanMEDS roles with more comments for collaborator and leader roles.; DISCUSSION: The wording of questions inviting free-text responses influences the volume and nature of the comments provided. Individuals designing multisource feedback tools should carefully consider wording of items soliciting narrative responses.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite recommendations supporting human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, pediatric vaccination rates remain suboptimal in the United States; lack of tools to support provider counseling is one barrier. We sought to evaluate HPV-related counseling materials for readability, suitability, and content, and assess parent perceptions of materials, using a health literacy perspective.; METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for written materials developed for HPV vaccination counseling by examining state Department of Health Web sites and associated links to local and national organizations. Materials were assessed for the following: 1) readability (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Fry), 2) suitability (understandability and actionability) (Suitability Assessment of Materials; Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials), and 3) coverage of 8 key content areas (recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Semistructured interviews were conducted with English-speaking parents or caregivers of children 9 to 17 years of age from 3 pediatric clinics (New York, Ohio, Illinois) serving predominantly low-income families to assess perceptions and usefulness of 4 handouts selected for review.; RESULTS: Thirty-eight documents were assessed. Mean± standard deviation (SD) reading grade level was 9.4±2; 10.5% (n=4) had a reading level of 6th grade or below; 68.4% (n=26) were considered not suitable. Mean understandability was 41.7%and mean actionability was 20.7%. Only 5.3% (n=2) addressed all 8 content areas mean±SD (number of areas=6.7±1.2). Brochure comprehensiveness and inclusion of a personal story were cited as factors that would be helpful in influencing parents to vaccinate against HPV.; CONCLUSIONS: Few written materials for HPV vaccination counseling were optimal from a health literacy best practices perspective. Content comprehensiveness was important for informed decision making. Copyright © 2017 Academic Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: To promote justice in research practice and rectify health disparities, greater diversity in research participation is needed. Lack of trust in medical research is one of the most significant obstacles to research participation. Multiple variables have been identified as factors associated with research participant trust/mistrust. A conceptual model that provides meaningful insight into the interplay of factors impacting trust may promote more ethical research practice and provide an enhanced, actionable understanding of participant mistrust.; METHODS: A structured survey was developed to capture attitudes toward research conducted in emergency situations; this article focuses on items designed to assess respondents' level of trust or mistrust in medical research in general. Community-based interviews were conducted in English or Spanish with 355 New York City residents (white 42%, African American 29%, Latino 22%).; RESULTS: Generally favorable attitudes toward research were expressed by a majority (85.3%), but many respondents expressed mistrust. Factor analysis yielded four specific domains of trust/mistrust, each of which was associated with different demographic variables: general trustworthiness (older age, not disabled); perceptions of discrimination (African American, Latino, Spanish language preference); perceptions of deception (prior research experience, African American); and perceptions of exploitation (less education).; CONCLUSIONS: The four domains identified in the analysis provide a framework for understanding specific areas of research trust/mistrust among disparate study populations. This model offers a conceptual basis for the design of tailored interventions that target specific groups to promote trust of individual researchers and research institutions as well as to facilitate broader research participation.

AB Individuals with serious mental illness are at particularly high risk for trauma; however, service environments with which they interact may not always be trauma-informed. While community mental health and other human services settings are moving toward trauma-informed care (TIC) service delivery, a variety of TIC frameworks exist without consensus regarding operationalization, thereby leading to challenges in implementation. TIC is principle-driven and presents substantial overlap with community psychology values and competencies, including ecological frameworks, second-order change, empowerment, and citizen participation. One way to address barriers to TIC implementation is to draw on the strengths of the field of community psychology. With a particular emphasis on the applicability of TIC to individuals with serious mental illness, this paper identifies key implementation issues and recommends future directions for community psychologists in clarifying the service framework, its adaptation to specific service contexts, and improving delivery through consultation and evaluation. Community psychologists may work with various disciplines involved in the TIC field to together promote a more conscious, actionable shift in service delivery. © Society for Community Research and Action 2017.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) heritability has been estimated to be around 30%. However, mutations in the known CRC-susceptibility genes explain CRC risk in fewer than 10% of affected individuals. Germline mutations in DNA-repair genes (DRGs) have recently been reported in CRC, but their contribution to CRC risk is largely unknown. We evaluated the gene-level germline mutation enrichment of 40 DRGs in 680 unselected CRC individuals and 27,728 ancestry-matched cancer-free adults. Significant findings were then examined in independent cohorts of 1,661 unselected CRC individuals and 1,456 individuals with early-onset CRC. Of the 680 individuals in the discovery set, 31 (4.56%) individuals harbored germline pathogenic mutations in known CRC-susceptibility genes, and another 33 (4.85%) individuals had DRG mutations that have not been previously associated with CRC risk. Germline pathogenic mutations in ATM and PALB2 were enriched in both the discovery (OR = 2.81 and p = 0.035 for ATM and OR = 4.91 and p = 0.024 for PALB2) and validation (OR = 2.97 and adjusted p = 0.0013 for ATM and OR = 3.42 and adjusted p = 0.034 for PALB2) sets. Biallelic loss of ATM was evident in all individuals with matched tumor profiling. CRC individuals also had higher rates of actionable mutations in the HR pathway, which can substantially increase the risk of developing cancers other than CRC. Our analysis provides evidence for ATM and PALB2 as CRC-risk genes, underscoring the importance of the homologous recombination pathway in CRC. In addition, we identified frequent complete homologous recombination deficiency in CRC tumors, representing a unique opportunity to explore targeted therapeutic interventions such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi).

AB BACKGROUND: Esophageal sarcomatoid carcinoma (ESC) is a rare disease with a mixture of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in the tumor. Its genetic background and mechanisms of oncogenesis remain largely unknown.; METHODS: Here we performed targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) on a pan-cancer gene panel in 15 ESC tumors to explore their genetic alterations, and aimed to identify clinically actionable mutations for future treatment instructions.; RESULTS: TP53 alterations were identified in all patients. Alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) were identified in 10 out of 15 patients. Members of downstream RAS and PI3-kinase pathways are also mutated in 10 patients, and PIK3CA is the top mutated gene in these pathways. In addition, we identified mutations on histone modification genes in 5 patients, including histone acetyltransferase gene EP300 and its homologue CREBBP, lysine methyltransferase genes KMT2A and KMT2B, and lysine demethylase gene KDM5A. Finally, mismatch repair (MMR) genes and proofreading gene POLE all together were mutated in one third of the ESC patients.; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to unravel the mutational profile of ESC tumors. Our findings could match 9 patients to the targeted therapies currently available in clinical practice or in active clinical trials, suggesting the potential utility of targeted therapies for this rare disease in the future.

AB We sought to uncover genetic drivers of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, using a targeted next-generation sequencing approach for detecting expressed gene rearrangements without prior knowledge of the fusion partners. We identified intergenic fusions involving driver genes, including PIK3CA, AKT3, RAF1, and ESR1, in 14% (24/173) of unselected patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer. FISH confirmed the corresponding chromosomal rearrangements in both primary and metastatic tumors. Expression of novel kinase fusions in nontransformed cells deregulates phosphoprotein signaling, cell proliferation, and survival in three-dimensional culture, whereas expression in HR+ breast cancer models modulates estrogen-dependent growth and confers hormonal therapy resistance in vitro and in vivo Strikingly, shorter overall survival was observed in patients with rearrangement-positive versus rearrangement-negative tumors. Correspondingly, fusions were uncommon (<5%) among 300 patients presenting with primary HR+ breast cancer. Collectively, our findings identify expressed gene fusions as frequent and potentially actionable drivers in HR+ breast cancer.Significance: By using a powerful clinical molecular diagnostic assay, we identified expressed intergenic fusions as frequent contributors to treatment resistance and poor survival in advanced HR+ breast cancer. The prevalence and biological and prognostic significance of these alterations suggests that their detection may alter clinical management and bring to light new therapeutic opportunities.

AB Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are genetically characterized by aberrations in TP53 and a low rate of activating point mutations in common oncogenes, rendering it challenging in applying targeted therapies. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify somatic genetic alterations in mouse models of TNBCs driven by loss of Trp53 alone or in combination with Brca1 Amplifications or translocations that resulted in elevated oncoprotein expression or oncoprotein-containing fusions, respectively, as well as frameshift mutations of tumor suppressors were identified in approximately 50% of the tumors evaluated. Although the spectrum of sporadic genetic alterations was diverse, the majority had in common the ability to activate the MAPK/PI3K pathways. Importantly, we demonstrated that approved or experimental drugs efficiently induce tumor regression specifically in tumors harboring somatic aberrations of the drug target. Our study suggests that the combination of WES and RNA-seq on human TNBC will lead to the identification of actionable therapeutic targets for precision medicine-guided TNBC treatment.Significance: Using combined WES and RNA-seq analyses, we identified sporadic oncogenic events in TNBC mouse models that share the capacity to activate the MAPK and/or PI3K pathways. Our data support a treatment tailored to the genetics of individual tumors that parallels the approaches being investigated in the ongoing NCI-MATCH, My Pathway Trial, and ESMART clinical trials.

AB Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disorder and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current treatment options for AF have significant limitations. Basic research has provided information on mechanisms relevant to the management of AF and promises to contribute significantly to future advances, yet many important translational challenges remain. Here, we analyze the therapeutic limitations for which improvement is needed, consider the translational opportunities presented by recent scientific and technological developments, and attempt to look into the future of where these may lead. We first review the limitations of current AF management, with a focus on rhythm control therapy. These include arrhythmia complications, progression to advanced treatment-resistant forms, insufficient effectiveness of available therapeutic options, adverse consequences of therapy, and difficulties in new therapeutic development. The translational challenges in addressing these shortcomings are then addressed, including (1) defining actionable patient-specific arrhythmia mechanisms to enable personalized therapy; (2) identifying and treating key dynamic modulators controlling AF initiation and progression; (3) achieving atrial-restricted targeting of specific molecular arrhythmia mechanisms; and (4) clarifying the response of the substrate to interventions. For each of these, we describe the translational goal and the opportunities created by recent advances in cardiac imaging, computational modeling, rhythm monitoring, ablation technology, and preclinical studies in human samples and animal models. Finally, we consider the prospects for future solutions that might appreciably improve our ability to understand and manage the arrhythmia over the years to come. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Children living in US inner cities experience disparate burdens of asthma, especially in severity, impairment, exacerbations, and morbidity. Investigations seeking to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying asthma prevalence, severity, and exacerbation in children living in these communities can lead to interventions that can narrow asthma disparities and potentially benefit all children with asthma. This update will focus on recent (i.e. late 2016-2017) advances in the understanding of asthma in US inner city children.; RECENT FINDINGS: Studies published in the past year expand understanding of asthma prevalence, severity, exacerbation, and the outcomes of guidelines-based management of these at-risk children, including: asthma phenotypes in US inner city children that are severe and difficult-to-control; key environmental determinants and mechanisms underlying asthma severity and exacerbations (e.g. allergy-mediated exacerbation susceptibility to rhinovirus); the importance of schools as a place for provocative exposures (e.g. mouse allergen, nitrogen dioxide) as well as a place where asthma care and outcomes can be improved; and the development and validation of clinically useful indices for gauging asthma severity and predicting exacerbations.; SUMMARY: These recent studies provide a trove of actionable findings that can improve asthma care and outcomes for these at-risk children.

AB The value of precision oncology initiatives in Asian contexts remains unresolved. Here, we review the institutional implementation of prospective molecular screening to facilitate accrual of patients into biomarker-driven clinical trials, and to explore the mutational landscape of advanced tumors occurring in a prospective cohort of Asian patients (n=396) with diverse cancer types. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and routine clinicopathological assays, such as immunohistochemistry, copy number analysis and in situ hybridization tests, were performed on tumor samples. Actionable biomarker results were used to identify eligibility for early-phase, biomarker-driven clinical trials. Overall, NGS was successful in 365 of 396 patients (92%), achieving a mean depth of 1,943* and coverage uniformity of 96%. The median turnaround time from sample receipt to return of genomic results was 26.0 days (IQR, 19.0-39.0 days). Reportable mutations were found in 300 of 365 patients (82%). Ninety-one percent of patients at study enrollment indicated consent to receive incidental findings and willingness to undergo genetic counseling if required. The most commonly mutated oncogenes included KRAS (19%), PIK3CA (16%), EGFR (5%), BRAF (3%) and KIT (3%); while the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes included TP53 (40%), SMARCB1 (12%), APC (8%), PTEN (6%) and SMAD4 (5%). Among 23 patients enrolled in genotype-matched trials, median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (IQR, 1.5-4.0 months). Nine of 20 evaluable patients (45%; 95% CI, 23.1-68.5%) derived clinical benefit, including 3 partial responses and 6 with stable disease lasting ≥ 8 weeks. © 2017 UICC.

AB BACKGROUND: Emergency Departments (ED) are challenged during influenza season by patients who present acutely during sporadic ED visits. ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat influenza A + B assay.; STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (<30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established pre-and post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies.; RESULTS: An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings > $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of ED-based influenza testing using the Cobas Liat assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively.; CONCLUSION: Providing rapid, RT-PCR influenza testing to ED settings is actionable and used to guide patient care decisions. Understanding the cascade of events linked to the influenza diagnosis in the ED provides overall cost savings which offset the cost of providing ED-based testing. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The emergence of evidence-supported interventions allows hospitals the opportunity to reduce future reinjury among patients who are violently injured. However, hospital knowledge of these interventions and their perceived role in violence prevention is unknown. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act created new legal requirements for non-profit hospitals to conduct community health needs assessments (CHNA) every three years to maintain not-for-profit status. In turn, this allows an empiric evaluation of hospital recognition and response to community violence. To do so, this study performed a content analysis of hospital CHNAs from the 20 U.S. cities with the highest violent crime rates. A total of 77 CHNAs were examined for specific violence-related keywords as well as whether violence prevention was listed as a priority community need. Overall, 74% of CHNAs mentioned violence-related terms and only 32% designated violence prevention as a priority need. When discussed, 88% of CHNAs referenced community violence, 42% intimate partner or sexual violence, and 22% child abuse. This study suggests that hospitals may lack awareness of violence as an actionable, preventable public health issue. Further, evidence-based program models are available to hospitals that can reduce the recurrence of assaultive injuries.

AB Background: Identification of pathogenic germline alterations (PGAs) has important clinical and therapeutic implications in pancreas cancer. We performed comprehensive germline testing (GT) in an unselected prospective cohort of patients with exocrine pancreatic neoplasms with genotype and phenotype association to facilitate identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers and examine potential therapeutic implications.; Methods: Six hundred fifteen unselected patients with exocrine pancreatic neoplasms were prospectively consented for somatic tumor and matched sample profiling for 410-468 genes. GT for PGAs in 76 genes associated with cancer susceptibility was performed in an "identified" manner in 356 (57.9%) patients and in an "anonymized" manner in 259 (42.1%) patients, using an institutional review board-approved protocol. Detailed clinical and pathological features, response to platinum, and overall survival (OS) were collected for the identified cohort. OS was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves.; Results: PGAs were present in 122 (19.8%) of 615 patients involving 24 different genes, including BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, and multiple additional genes associated with the DNA damage response pathway. Of 122 patients with germline alterations, 41.8% did not meet current guidelines for GT. The difference in median OS was not statistically significant between patients with and without PGA (50.8 months, 95% confidence interval = 34.5 to not reached, two-sided P = .94). Loss of heterozygosity was found in 60.0% of BRCA1/2.; Conclusions: PGAs frequently occur in pancreas exocrine neoplasms and involve multiple genes beyond those previously associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer. These PGAs are therapeutically actionable in about 5% to 10% of patients. These data support routinely offering GT in all pancreatic ductal adenocarcimona patients with a broad panel of known hereditary cancer predisposition genes.

AB Telomere length (TL) predicts the onset of cellular senescence in vitro but the diagnostic utility of TL measurement in clinical settings is not fully known. We tested the value of TL measurement by flow cytometry and FISH (flowFISH) in patients with mutations in telomerase and telomere maintenance genes. TL had a discrete and reproducible normal range with definable upper and lower boundaries. While TL above the 50th age-adjusted percentile had a 100% negative predictive value for clinically relevant mutations, the lower threshold in mutation carriers was age-dependent, and adult mutation carriers often overlapped with the lowest decile of controls. The extent of telomere shortening correlated with the age at diagnosis as well as the short telomere syndrome phenotype. Extremely short TL caused bone marrow failure and immunodeficiency in children and young adults, while milder defects manifested as pulmonary fibrosis-emphysema in adults. We prospectively examined whether TL altered treatment decisions for newly diagnosed idiopathic bone marrow failure patients and found abnormally short TL enriched for patients with mutations in some inherited bone marrow failure genes, such as RUNX1, in addition to telomerase and telomere maintenance genes. The result was actionable, altering the choice of treatment regimen and/or hematopoietic stem cell donor in one-fourth of the cases (9 of 38, 24%). We conclude that TL measurement by flowFISH, when used for targeted clinical indications and in limited settings, can influence treatment decisions in ways that improve outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Reluctance to share hereditary cancer syndrome genetic test results with family is reported among Asian patients. This study aims to explore patient factors influencing result sharing with family, to improve overall testing uptake.; METHODS: Participants were women with a personal/family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer who received a positive, negative, or variant of uncertain significance test result. In-depth interviews were conducted to theme saturation to explore facilitators and barriers for sharing results with family. Grounded theory with thematic analysis was applied in analysis and interpretation.; RESULTS: Twenty-four women participated. Three themes representing facilitators emerged for all results categories: family closeness, involvement of families in the testing process, and perception of low emotional impact of results. In the positive result category, 2 facilitator themes emerged: presence of actionable results and perception of family members' acceptance. In the negative and variant of uncertain significance result categories, 2 themes representing barriers to sharing emerged: perception of no genetic or medical implication for family and result ambiguity.; CONCLUSION: Facilitators and barriers for result sharing are similar to those among Western women. A framework to explain Asian patients' decision-making process identifies optimal counselling opportunities to enhance communication with family. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The rapid ageing of the population is a worldwide inexorable demographic transformation. At a time of immense social, political and economic change, the growing elderly population is at the forefront of global burden, placing an increasing strain on the federal, state, and local budgets. Many public policy responses to the impending ageing epidemic have begun, particularly with regards to dementia prevention and quality of life for older adults. However, to date, the fruition of such efforts remains to be discovered. Indeed, there is a need to find more novel and multifaceted ways of understanding the fragmentary changes and underlying mechanisms in the biopsychosocial contexts of ageing. Discovering better ways to measure these intricate domains will create better insight into how to improve clinical and public health information systems for the development of more personalisation support and services across the continuum of aged care. Technology now permeates all aspects of our everyday living. Digital footprints are data arising as a by-product of interactions we do as part of everyday living. The digital traces we live behind, be it on internet, social media, on mobile phone apps, as well as in health records (EHRs) could be used to infer how we behave and interact with environment, and how we feel in different situations. Commercial sector has very successfully used these footprints in the advertisement and marketing space. This type of information may provide clinicians with an unobtrusive way of monitoring older adults in their daily living, and provide an alternative means to traditional self-report and expert-rated assessment. In this paper we present two innovative digital footprint applications, Actionable Intime Insights and the SAIL Mobile app, which aim to facilitate "Ageing in Place" through adaptive, dynamic, early intervention strategies. These systems are devised to unveil contextual indicators of how a person is functioning mentally, socially, behaviourally and physically in their own environment, as to as assist those with chronic conditions better self-manage by facilitating assistance with care and medication needs just in time.

AB Extracellular fluid overload (FO), which is assessed using bioimpedance technologies, is an important predictor of outcome in dialysis patients and in patients with early stages of chronic kidney disease. While traditional cardiovascular abnormalities are assumed to mediate this risk, recently also, the importance of noncardiovascular factors, such as systemic inflammation and malnutrition has been shown. While both FO and inflammation are independent risk factors for mortality, recent studies have shown that their combined presence can lead to a cumulative risk profile. From a pathophysiologic viewpoint, FO and inflammation can also be mutually reinforcing. Inflammation could contribute to FO by hypoalbuminemia, capillary leakage, and a (unnoticed) decline in lean and/or fat tissue mass resulting in incorrect estimation of dry weight. Reciprocally, FO could lead to inflammation by the translocation of endotoxins through a congested bowel wall or by a proinflammatory effect of tissue sodium. The relative importance of these putative factors is, however, not clear yet and epidemiological studies have shown no clear temporal direction regarding the relationship between FO and inflammation. FO and inflammation appear to be part of (dynamic) clusters of risk factors, including malnutrition and hyponatremia. Technology-guided fluid management of the often vulnerable dialysis patient with FO and inflammation cannot yet be based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, in which these specific patients were in general not included. In the absence of those trials, treatment should be based on identifying actionable causes of inflammation and on the judicious removal of excess volume based on frequent clinical reassessment. © 2018 S.

AB BACKGROUND: There are many challenges in delivering and evaluating knowledge for healthcare, but the lack of clear routes from knowledge to practice is a root cause of failures in safety within healthcare. Various types and sources of knowledge are relevant at different levels within the healthcare system. These need to be delivered in a timely way that is useful and actionable for those providing services or developing policies. How knowledge is taken up and used through networks and relationships, and the difficulties in attributing change to knowledge-based interventions, present challenges to understanding how knowledge into action (K2A) work influences healthcare outcomes. This makes it difficult to demonstrate the importance of K2A work, and harness support for its development and resourcing. This paper presents the results from a project commissioned by NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) to create an evaluation framework to help understand the NHS Scotland Knowledge into Action model.; METHODS: The team took a developmental approach to creating an evaluation framework that would be useful and practical. This included a literature review to ensure the evaluation was evidence-based; adaptation of contribution analysis for K2A project; action research with K2A project leads to refine the work and develop suitable measures.; RESULTS: Principles for evaluation and an evaluation framework based on contribution analysis were developed and implemented on a trial project. An outcomes chain was developed for the K2A programme and specific projects. This was used to design, collect and collate evidence of the K2A intervention. Data collected routinely by the intervention was supplemented with specific feedback measures from K2A project users.; CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation approach allowed for scrutiny of both processes and outcomes and was adaptable to projects on different scales. This framework has proved useful as a planning, reflecting and evaluation tool for K2A, and could be more widely used to evidence the ways in which knowledge to action work helps improve healthcare outcomes.

AB Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are important drivers of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and have led to the emergence of EGFR-targeted therapies as critical treatment options for NSCLC. Although these agents have shown clinical activity in NSCLC patients, acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted agents is inevitable. Therefore, the ability to conveniently biopsy patient tumors is of increasing importance as new mechanisms of resistance and agents to target these resistance mutations are identified. Rapid and accurate EGFR mutational testing of patient biopsy specimens, including liquid biopsy specimens, allows for the identification of potentially actionable mutations that could guide treatment. In the present review, we discuss the various methods and best practices for tumor sampling and EGFR mutational testing in NSCLC. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB PurposeApplication of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing is likely to increase in clinical practice, public health contexts, and research. We investigated how parental preference for acquiring information from genome-scale testing is influenced by the characteristics of non-medically actionable genetic disorders in children, as well as whether the preferences differed by gender and between African-American and white respondents.MethodsWe conducted a Web-based discrete-choice experiment with 1,289 parents of young children. Participants completed "choice tasks" based on pairs of profiles describing sequencing results for hypothetical genetic disorders, selected the profile in each pair that they believed represented the information that would be more important to know, and answered questions that measured their level of distress.ResultsKnowing the likelihood that the disorder would develop given a true-positive test result was most important to parents. Parents showed greater interest in learning sequencing results for disease profiles with more severe manifestations. This was associated with greater distress. Differences by gender and race reflected small differences in magnitude, but not direction.ConclusionParents preferred to learn results about genetic disorders with more severe manifestations, even when this knowledge was associated with increased distress. These results may help clinicians support parental decision making by revealing which types of sequencing results parents are interested in learning.

AB Six states that have rejected the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion nonetheless extended the primary care "fee bump," by which the federal government increased Medicaid fees for primary care services up to 100 percent of Medicare fees during 2013-14. We conducted semistructured interviews with leaders in five of these states, as well as in three comparison states, to examine why they would continue a provision of the ACA that moderately expands access at significant state expense while rejecting the expansion and its large federal match, focusing on relevant economic, political, and procedural factors. We found that fee bump extension proposals were more successful where they were dissociated from major national policy debates, actionable with the input of relatively few stakeholder entities, and well aligned with preexisting policy-making structures and decision trends. Republican proposals to cap or reduce federal funding for Medicaid, if enacted, would compel states to contain program costs. In this context, states' established decision-making processes for updating Medicaid fee schedules, which we elucidate in this study, may shape the future of the Medicaid program.

AB The advent of immunotherapy, especially checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy, has provided novel and powerful weapons against cancer. Because only a subset of cancer patients exhibit durable responses, further exploration of the mechanisms underlying the resistance to immunotherapy in the bulk of cancer patients is merited. Such efforts may help to identify which patients could benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. Given the existence of a great number of pathways by which cancer can escape immune surveillance, and the complexity of tumor-immune system interaction, development of various combination therapies, including those that combine with conventional therapies, would be necessary. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms by which resistance to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy occurs, and outline how actionable combination strategies may be derived to improve clinical outcomes for patients.

AB This review summarizes the case for investing in adolescence as a period of rapid growth, learning, adaptation, and formational neurobiological development. Adolescence is a dynamic maturational period during which young lives can pivot rapidly-in both negative and positive directions. Scientific progress in understanding adolescent development provides actionable insights into windows of opportunity during which policies can have a positive impact on developmental trajectories relating to health, education, and social and economic success. Given current global changes and challenges that affect adolescents, there is a compelling need to leverage these advances in developmental science to inform strategic investments in adolescent health.

AB TP53 mutations occur in 50% of all human tumors, with increased frequency in aggressive cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat. Additionally, p53 missense mutations are remarkably predictive of refractoriness to chemo/radiotherapy in various malignancies. These observations have led to the development of mutant p53-targeting agents that restore p53 function. An important unknown is which p53-mutant tumors will respond to p53 reactivation-based therapies. Here, we found a heterogeneous impact on therapeutic response to p53 restoration, suggesting that it will unlikely be effective as a monotherapy. Through gene expression profiling of p53R172H -mutant lymphomas, we identified retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) as an actionable target and demonstrated that pharmacological activation of RARgamma with a synthetic retinoid sensitizes resistant p53-mutant lymphomas to p53 restoration, while additively improving outcome and survival in inherently sensitive tumors.

AB Cytology samples are increasingly used for comprehensive molecular testing. Although fine-needle aspirates are adequate substrates for high-throughput sequencing, the suitability of malignant body fluids remains largely unexplored. We investigated the adequacy and utility of performing targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on malignant effusions from patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Thirty-two effusion samples submitted for hybrid capture-based NGS using a clinically validated solid tumor genotyping panel were examined. All cases showed ≥5% tumor cellularity; however, 28 (88%) provided sufficient DNA for NGS (≥1 ng/muL). The sequencing reads showed satisfactory quality control statistics, and the variant allele frequencies were correlated with tumor cellularity. Furthermore, pathogenic or likely pathogenic genomic alterations were identified in 26 of 28 samples (93%), whereas clinically actionable alterations were present in 18 (64%). Notably, nine patients had additional molecular testing performed on preceding or subsequent biopsy specimens, and the results across multiple samples were compared. In two patients, the NGS-based fluid analysis identified clinically actionable alterations that were not detected by other hotspot testing. In four patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, malignant fluid sequencing confirmed driver alterations from prior testing and revealed new resistance mechanisms. Hence, given adequate DNA input and tumor cellularity, comprehensive genomic profiling of malignant effusions may be used to establish mutational status at diagnosis and inform treatment resistance during targeted therapy.

AB Targeted next-generation sequencing panels are increasingly used to assess the value of gene mutations for clinical diagnostic purposes. For assay development, amplicon-based methods have been preferentially used on the basis of short preparation time and small DNA input amounts. However, capture sequencing has emerged as an alternative approach because of high testing accuracy. We compared capture hybridization and amplicon sequencing approaches using fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from eight lymphoma patients. Next, we developed a targeted sequencing pipeline using a 32-gene panel for accurate detection of actionable mutations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples of the most common lymphocytic malignancies: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. We show that hybrid capture is superior to amplicon sequencing by providing deep more uniform coverage and yielding higher sensitivity for variant calling. Sanger sequencing of 588 variants identified specificity limits of thresholds for mutation calling, and orthogonal validation on 66 cases indicated 93% concordance with whole-genome sequencing. The developed pipeline and assay identified at least one actionable mutation in 91% of tumors from 219 lymphoma patients and revealed subtype-specific mutation patterns and frequencies consistent with the literature. This pipeline is an accurate and sensitive method for identifying actionable gene mutations in routinely acquired biopsy materials, suggesting further assessment of capture-based assays in the context of personalized lymphoma management.

AB Metastatic basal cell cancer (BCC) is an ultra-rare malignancy with no approved therapies beyond Hedgehog inhibitors. We characterized the genomics, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and anti-PD-1 therapy responses in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC. Overall, 2,039 diverse cancer samples that had undergone comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) were reviewed. Eight patients with locally advanced/metastatic BCC were identified (two had two CGP analyses; total, 10 biopsies). Two tumors demonstrated PD-L1 amplification. Seven patients had >1 actionable alteration. The TMB (mutations/mb) (median (range)) was 90 (3-103) for the BCCs versus 4 (1-860) for 1637 cancers other than BCC (P < 0.0001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all four patients treated with PD-1 blockade was 10.7months (range, 3.8 to 17.6+ months); three patients had an objective response. In conclusion, advanced/metastatic BCC often has biological features (high TMB; PD-L1 amplification) predictive of immunotherapy benefit, and patients frequently respond to PD-1 blockade.

AB Clinical genome and exome sequencing (CGES) may identify variants leading to targeted management of existing conditions. Yet, CGES often fails to identify pathogenic diagnostic variants and introduces uncertainties by detecting variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and secondary findings. This study investigated how families understand findings and adjust their perspectives on CGES. As part of NIH's Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Consortium, children were recruited from clinics at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania (CHOP) and offered exome sequencing. Primary pathogenic and possibly pathogenic, and some secondary findings were returned. Investigators digitally recorded results disclosure sessions and conducted 3-month follow up interviews with 10 adolescents and a parent. An interdisciplinary team coded all transcripts. Participants were initially disappointed with findings, yet reactions evolved within disclosure sessions and at 3-month interviews toward acceptance and satisfaction. Families erroneously expected, and prepared extensively, to learn about risk for common conditions. During disclosure sessions, parents and adolescents varied in how they monitored and responded to each others reactions. Several misinterpreted, or overestimated, the utility of findings to attribute meaning and achieve closure for the CGES experience. Participants perceived testing as an opportunity to improve disease management despite results that did not introduce new treatments or diagnoses. Future research may examine whether families experience cognitive dissonance regarding discrepancies between expectations and findings, and how protective buffering minimizes the burden of disappointment on loved ones. As CGES is increasingly integrated into clinical care providers must contend with tempering family expectations and interpretations of findings while managing complex medical care. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Tissue biopsy is the standard diagnostic procedure for cancer. Biopsy may also provide material for genotyping, which can assist in the diagnosis and selection of targeted therapies but may fall short in cases of inadequate sampling, particularly from highly heterogeneous tumors. Traditional tissue biopsy suffers greater limitations in its prognostic capability over the course of disease, most obviously as an invasive procedure with potential complications, but also with respect to probable tumor clonal evolution and metastasis over time from initial biopsy evaluation. Recent work highlights circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) present in the blood as a supplemental, or perhaps an alternative, source of DNA to identify the clinically relevant cancer mutational landscape. Indeed, this noninvasive approach may facilitate repeated monitoring of disease progression and treatment response, serving as a means to guide targeted therapies based on detected actionable mutations in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Notably, ctDNA is heralding a revolution in the range of genomic profiling and molecular mechanisms to be utilized in the battle against cancer. This review will discuss the biology of ctDNA, current methods of detection and potential applications of this information in tumor diagnosis, treatment, and disease prognosis. Conventional classification of tumors to describe cancer stage follow the TNM notation system, heavily weighting local tumor extent (T), lymph node invasion (N), and detectable metastasis (M). With recent advancements in genomics and bioinformatics, it is conceivable that routine analysis of ctDNA from liquid biopsy (B) may make cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis more accurate for individual patients. We put forward the futuristic concept of TNMB tumor classification, opening a new horizon for precision medicine with the hope of creating better outcomes for cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulators are frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers, leading to altered transcription states that result in changes in cell identity, behavior, and response to therapy.; RESULTS: To define alterations in epigenetic landscapes in breast cancers, we profiled the distributions of 8 key histone modifications by ChIP-Seq, as well as primary (GRO-seq) and steady state (RNA-Seq) transcriptomes, across 13 distinct cell lines that represent 5 molecular subtypes of breast cancer and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells.; DISCUSSION: Using combinatorial patterns of distinct histone modification signals, we defined subtype-specific chromatin signatures to nominate potential biomarkers. This approach identified AFAP1-AS1 as a triple negative breast cancer-specific gene associated with cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. In addition, our chromatin mapping data in basal TNBC cell lines are consistent with gene expression patterns in TCGA that indicate decreased activity of the androgen receptor pathway but increased activity of the vitamin D biosynthesis pathway.; CONCLUSIONS: Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive resource for histone modification profiles that define epigenetic landscapes and reveal key chromatin signatures in breast cancer cell line subtypes with potential to identify novel and actionable targets for treatment.

AB The therapeutic approach for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without actionable mutations has been revolutionized by the recent approval of new effective drugs with various mechanisms of action, including nintedanib, ramucirumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and afatinib. The recent network meta-analysis of Crequit et al. (BMC Medicine, 15:193, 2017) compared the effectiveness and tolerability of the second-line treatments for advanced NSCLC with wild-type or unknown status for EGFR. The authors found that immunotherapy might be more efficacious than the currently recommended treatments. However, their meta-analysis does not take into account the role of predictive biomarkers - this is indeed a crucial point in the decision-making process considering that only a fraction of advanced NSCLC patients might derive a long-term benefit from second-line immunotherapy. The identification of molecular biomarkers that can predict a response to immune checkpoints, angiogenesis, and EGFR inhibitors remains an important goal of clinical research in order to maximize the benefit of these agents and to aid clinicians in the decision-making process.Please see related article: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0954-x.

AB Neuropilins are a class of cell surface proteins implicated in cell migration and angiogenesis, with aberrant expression in human tumors. Here, we show that the expression of Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) controls EGFR protein levels, thereby impinging on intracellular signaling, viability, and response to targeted therapies of oncogene-addicted cells. Notably, increased NRP2 expression in EGFR-addicted tumor cells led to downregulation of EGFR protein and tumor cell growth inhibition. NRP2 also blunted upregulation of an EGFR "rescue" pathway induced by targeted therapy in Met-addicted carcinoma cells. Cancer cells acquiring resistance to MET oncogene-targeted drugs invariably underwent NRP2 loss, a step required for EGFR upregulation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that NRP2 loss activated NFkB and upregulated the EGFR-associated protein KIAA1199/CEMIP, which is known to oppose the degradation of activated EGFR kinase. Notably, KIAA1199 silencing in oncogene-addicted tumor cells improved therapeutic responses and counteracted acquired drug resistance. Our findings define NRP2 as the pivotal switch of a novel broad-acting and actionable pathway controlling EGFR signaling, and driving resistance to therapies targeting oncogene-addiction.Significance: These important findings identify the cell surface molecule Nrp2 as the pivotal switch of a novel, actionable pathway driving EGFR upregulation and resistance to oncogene- targeted therapies.

AB Addressing drug resistance is a core challenge in cancer research, but the degree of heterogeneity in resistance mechanisms in cancer is unclear. In this study, we conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor cells (CTC) from patients with advanced cancer to assess mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy and reveal opportunities for precision medicine. Comparison of the genomic landscapes of CTCs and tissue metastases is complicated by challenges in comprehensive CTC genomic profiling and paired tissue acquisition, particularly in patients who progress after targeted therapy. Thus, we assessed by NGS somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) in archived CTCs isolated from patients with metastatic breast cancer who were enrolled in concurrent clinical trials that collected and analyzed CTCs and metastatic tissues. In 76 individual and pooled informative CTCs from 12 patients, we observed 85% concordance in at least one or more prioritized somatic mutations and CNA between paired CTCs and tissue metastases. Potentially actionable genomic alterations were identified in tissue but not CTCs, and vice versa. CTC profiling identified diverse intra- and interpatient molecular mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance, including loss of heterozygosity in individual CTCs. For example, in one patient, we observed CTCs that were either wild type for ESR1 (n = 5/32), harbored the known activating ESR1 p.Y537S mutation (n = 26/32), or harbored a novel ESR1 p.A569S (n = 1/32). ESR1 p.A569S was modestly activating in vitro, consistent with its presence as a minority circulating subclone. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and potential clinical utility of comprehensive profiling of archived fixed CTCs. Tissue and CTC genomic assessment are complementary, and precise combination therapies will likely be required for effective targeting in advanced breast cancer patients.Significance: These findings demonstrate the complementary nature of genomic profiling from paired tissue metastasis and circulating tumor cells from patients with metastatic breast cancer.

AB With the advent of widespread genomic testing for diagnostic indications and disease risk assessment, there is increased need to optimize genetic counseling services to support the scalable delivery of precision medicine. Here, we describe how we operationalized the reciprocal engagement model of genetic counseling practice to develop a framework of counseling components and strategies for the delivery of genomic results. This framework was constructed based upon qualitative research with patients receiving genomic counseling following online receipt of potentially actionable complex disease and pharmacogenomics reports. Consultation with a transdisciplinary group of investigators, including practicing genetic counselors, was sought to ensure broad scope and applicability of these strategies for use with any large-scale genomic testing effort. We preserve the provision of pre-test education and informed consent as established in Mendelian/single-gene disease genetic counseling practice. Following receipt of genomic results, patients are afforded the opportunity to tailor the counseling agenda by selecting the specific test results they wish to discuss, specifying questions for discussion, and indicating their preference for counseling modality. The genetic counselor uses these patient preferences to set the genomic counseling session and to personalize result communication and risk reduction recommendations. Tailored visual aids and result summary reports divide areas of risk (genetic variant, family history, lifestyle) for each disease to facilitate discussion of multiple disease risks. Post-counseling, session summary reports are actively routed to both the patient and their physician team to encourage review and follow-up. Given the breadth of genomic information potentially resulting from genomic testing, this framework is put forth as a starting point to meet the need for scalable genetic counseling services in the delivery of precision medicine.

AB T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare and poor-prognostic mature T-cell malignancy. Here we integrated large-scale profiling data of alterations in gene expression, allelic copy number (CN), and nucleotide sequences in 111 well-characterized patients. Besides prominent signatures of T-cell activation and prevalent clonal variants, we also identify novel hot-spots for CN variability, fusion molecules, alternative transcripts, and progression-associated dynamics. The overall lesional spectrum of T-PLL is mainly annotated to axes of DNA damage responses, T-cell receptor/cytokine signaling, and histone modulation. We formulate a multi-dimensional model of T-PLL pathogenesis centered around a unique combination of TCL1 overexpression with damaging ATM aberrations as initiating core lesions. The effects imposed by TCL1 cooperate with compromised ATM toward a leukemogenic phenotype of impaired DNA damage processing. Dysfunctional ATM appears inefficient in alleviating elevated redox burdens and telomere attrition and in evoking a p53-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic insults. As non-genotoxic strategies, synergistic combinations of p53 reactivators and deacetylase inhibitors reinstate such cell death execution.

AB The gene encoding the receptor-tyrosine kinase RET was first discovered more than three decades ago, and activating RET rearrangements and mutations have since been identified as actionable drivers of oncogenesis. Several multikinase inhibitors with activity against RET have been explored in the clinic, and confirmed responses to targeted therapy with these agents have been observed in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers or RET-mutant thyroid cancers. Nevertheless, response rates to RET-directed therapy are modest compared with those achieved using targeted therapies matched to other oncogenic drivers of solid tumours, such as sensitizing EGFR or BRAFV600E mutations, or ALK or ROS1 rearrangements. To date, no RET-directed targeted therapeutic has received regulatory approval for the treatment of molecularly defined populations of patients with RET-mutant or RET-rearranged solid tumours. In this Review, we discuss how emerging data have informed the debate over whether the limited success of multikinase inhibitors with activity against RET can be attributed to the tractability of RET as a drug target or to the lack, until 2017, of highly specific inhibitors of this oncoprotein in the clinic. We emphasize that novel approaches to targeting RET-dependent tumours are necessary to improve the clinical efficacy of single-agent multikinase inhibition and, thus, hasten approvals of RET-directed targeted therapies.

AB The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. It encodes p53, a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates multiple genes involved in DNA repair, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. TP53 is associated with human cancer by mutations that lead to a loss of wild-type p53 function as well as mutations that confer alternate oncogenic functions that enable them to promote invasion, metastasis, proliferation, and cell survival. Identifying the discrete TP53 mutations in tumor cells may help direct therapies that are more effective. In this study, we identified the frequency of individual TP53 mutations in patients with colon adenocarcinoma (48%), non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (36%), and glioma/glioblastoma (28%) at our institution using next-generation sequencing. We also identified the occurrence of somatic mutations in numerous actionable genes including BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, IDH1, and PIK3CA that occurred concurrently with these TP53 mutations. Of the 480 tumors examined that contained one or more mutations in the TP53 gene, 219 were colon adenocarcinomas, 215 were NSCLCs, and 46 were gliomas/glioblastomas. Among the patients positive for TP53 mutations diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma, 50% also showed at least one mutation in pathogenic genes of which 14% were BRAF, 33% were KRAS, and 3% were NRAS. Forty-seven percent of NSCLC patients harboring TP53 mutations also had a mutation in at least one actionable pathogenic variant with the following frequencies: BRAF: 4%, EGFR: 10%, KRAS: 28%, and PIK3CA: 4%. Fifty-two percent of patients diagnosed with glioma/glioblastoma with a positive TP53 mutation had at least one concurrent mutation in a known pathogenic gene of which 9% were CDKN2A, 41% were IDH1, and 11% were PIK3CA.

AB The scale-up of rapid drug resistance testing for TB is a global priority. MTBDRplus is a WHO-endorsed multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB PCR assay with suboptimal sensitivities and high indeterminate rates on smear-negative specimens. We hypothesised that widespread use of incorrect thermocycler ramp rate (speed of temperature change between cycles) impacts performance. A global sample of 72 laboratories was surveyed. We tested 107 sputa from Xpert MTB/RIF-positive patients and, separately, dilution series of bacilli, both at the manufacturer-recommended ramp rate (2.2°C/s) and the most frequently reported incorrect ramp rate (4.0°C/s). Mycobacterium tuberculosis-complex DNA (TUB-band)-detection, indeterminate results, accuracy, and inter-reader variability (dilution series only) were compared. 32 respondents did a median (IQR) of 41 (20-150) assays monthly. 78% used an incorrect ramp rate. On smear-negative sputa, 2.2°C/s vs. 4.0°C/s improved TUB-band positivity (42/55 vs. 32/55; p=0.042) and indeterminate rates (1/42 vs. 5/32; p=0.039). The actionable results (not TUB-negative or indeterminate; 41/55 vs. 28/55) hence improved by 21% (95% CI: 9-35%). Widespread use of incorrect ramp rate contributes to suboptimal MTBDRplus performance on smear-negative specimens and hence limits clinical utility. The number of diagnoses (and thus the number of smear-negative patients in whom DST is possible) will improve substantially after ramp rate correction.

AB Clinicians still employ a "trial-and-error" approach to optimizing treatment regimens for late-life depression (LLD). With LLD affecting a significant and growing segment of the population, and with only about half of older adults responsive to antidepressant therapy, there is an urgent need for a better treatment paradigm. Pharmacogenetic decision support tools (DSTs), which are emerging technologies that aim to provide clinically actionable information based on a patient's genetic profile, offer a promising solution. Dozens of DSTs have entered the market in the past 15 years, but with varying level of empirical evidence to support their value. In this clinical review, we provide a critical analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on DSTs for major depression management. We then discuss clinical considerations for the use of these tools in treating LLD, including issues related to test interpretation, timing, and patient perspectives. In adult populations, newer generation DSTs show promise for the treatment of major depression. However, there are no primary clinical trials in LLD cohorts. Independent and comparative clinical trials are needed. Copyright © 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We previously reported on a family with hereditary lung cancer, in which a germline mutation in the transmembrane domain (G660D) of avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2) (ERBB2; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) seemed to be responsible for the cancer predisposition. Although few data are available on treatment, anti-ERBB2 therapeutic agents may be effective for ERBB2-mutant cancers. The familial lung cancer patient in one of the authors' institutes developed bone metastasis with enlarging lung tumors and was treated with the ERBB2 inhibitor afatinib. We also encountered a patient with ampullary adenocarcinoma with ERBB2 G660D and S310F comutations in another institute of the authors', revealed by comprehensive genomic profiling. This patient was then treated with afatinib and also achieved transitory response. We also searched for ERBB2 transmembrane mutations in various types of cancers in PubMed, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) database. Besides our two cases, two patients with V659E mutations were found via PubMed. Three potential patients were found in TCGA. In addition, MSK-IMPACT allowed identification of three additional urothelial carcinomas with G660D mutations and two lung adenocarcinomas with V659E mutations. Our experience suggests that establishing a database of integrated information regarding the clinical genome and therapeutic outcome of patients with recurrent but less common mutations is essential to implement precision oncology.; KEY POINTS: Rare but targetable mutations such as avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2) (ERBB2; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) transmembrane domain (TMD) mutations can be detected by comprehensive genomic profiling.Afatinib may be effective for patients with cancer with ERBB2 (HER2) TMD mutations.In order to implement precision oncology, it is important to establish a database of integrated information regarding the clinical genomes and therapeutic outcomes of patients with recurrent but less common mutations. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with rare tumors may lack approved treatments and clinical trial access. Although each rare tumor is uncommon, cumulatively they account for approximately 25% of cancers. We recently initiated a Rare Tumor Clinic that emphasized a precision medicine strategy.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the first 40 patients presenting at the Rare Tumor Clinic. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tissue and plasma-derived, circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA), and protein markers were assessed.; RESULTS: Median age was 58 years (range, 31-78 years); 70% (28/40) were women; median number of previous systemic therapies was 2 (range 0-7). The most common diagnoses were sarcoma (n=7) for solid tumors and Erdheim-Chester disease (n=5) for hematologic malignancies. Twenty distinct diagnoses were seen. Examples of ultrarare tumors included ameloblastoma, yolk sac liver tumor, ampullary cancer, and Castleman's disease. Altogether, 32 of 33 patients (97%) with tissue NGS and 15 of 33 (45%) with ctDNA sequencing harbored ≥1 alteration. Overall, 92.5% of patients (37/40) had ≥1 actionable target based on either genomic (n=32) or protein (n=27) markers. In total, 52.5% (21/40) received matched therapy; 52.4% (11/21) achieved stable disease (SD) ≥6 months (n=3), partial remission (PR; n=6), or complete remission (CR; n=2). Matched therapy resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival compared with last prior unmatched therapy (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.71, p=.008).; CONCLUSION: Identifying genomic and protein markers in patients with rare/ultrarare tumors was feasible. When therapies were matched, >50% of patients attained SD ≥6 months, PR, or CR. Further precision medicine clinical investigations focusing on rare and ultrarare tumors are urgently needed.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Although rare tumors are infrequent by definition, when all subtypes of rare cancers are combined, they account for approximately 25% of adult malignancies. However, patients with rare tumors may lack approved treatments and clinical trial access. This paper describes an institutional a Rare Tumor Clinic focused on a precision medicine strategy. Performing genomics and protein analyses was feasible amongst patients with rare cancers. Over 50% of patients attained SD ≥6 months, PR, or CR when they received matched therapy (genomically targeted and/or immunotherapy). Further studies investigating the efficacy of the precision therapy approach among rare tumors are warranted. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to guide cancer therapy has created challenges in analyzing and reporting large volumes of genomic data to patients and caregivers. Specifically, providing current, accurate information on newly approved therapies and open clinical trials requires considerable manual curation performed mainly by human "molecular tumor boards" (MTBs). The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of cognitive computing as performed by Watson for Genomics (WfG) compared with a human MTB.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand eighteen patient cases that previously underwent targeted exon sequencing at the University of North Carolina (UNC) and subsequent analysis by the UNCseq informatics pipeline and the UNC MTB between November 7, 2011, and May 12, 2015, were analyzed with WfG, a cognitive computing technology for genomic analysis.; RESULTS: Using a WfG-curated actionable gene list, we identified additional genomic events of potential significance (not discovered by traditional MTB curation) in 323 (32%) patients. The majority of these additional genomic events were considered actionable based upon their ability to qualify patients for biomarker-selected clinical trials. Indeed, the opening of a relevant clinical trial within 1 month prior to WfG analysis provided the rationale for identification of a new actionable event in nearly a quarter of the 323 patients. This automated analysis took <3 minutes per case.; CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the interpretation and actionability of somatic NGS results are evolving too rapidly to rely solely on human curation. Molecular tumor boards empowered by cognitive computing could potentially improve patient care by providing a rapid, comprehensive approach for data analysis and consideration of up-to-date availability of clinical trials.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this study demonstrate that the interpretation and actionability of somatic next-generation sequencing results are evolving too rapidly to rely solely on human curation. Molecular tumor boards empowered by cognitive computing can significantly improve patient care by providing a fast, cost-effective, and comprehensive approach for data analysis in the delivery of precision medicine. Patients and physicians who are considering enrollment in clinical trials may benefit from the support of such tools applied to genomic data. © AlphaMed Press 2017.

AB Biliary tract cancer (BTC) represents a heterogeneous disease with dismal outcome. Herein, we examined genotype and angiogenesis features in BTC. We applied genotyping (Sanger, qPCR, 101-gene panel NGS), mRNA relative quantification methods, and beta-catenin immunohistochemistry in 84 FFPE BTC (55 gallbladder [GBC], 14 intrahepatic [ICC], 15 extrahepatic [ECC] carcinomas). We identified 541 mutations in 68 (81%) tumors. Top mutated genes were CTNNB1 (36%); PTEN (33%); TP53 (31%); PIK3R1 (29%); PIK3CA (13%); BRCA2 and KRAS (12%); BRCA1 (11%). Six GBCs were hypermutated [hm] displaying a distinct mutational pattern. Mutations in TP53 and PI3K, Wnt and RAS components were prevalent among non-hypermutated tumors. All hmGBCs carried mutations in BRCA2 and other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, in PD1, but not in CTNNB1 and KRAS. None of the pathogenic BRCA2 p.D2723G and BRCA1 p.Q563* and c.5266dupC was present at frequencies expected for germline mutations. We observed copy gains (>6 copies) in EGFR (9% of informative tumors), PRKAR1A (7%), PIK3CA (6%), ERBB2 (5%) and MET (4%). TP53 mutations were prevalent in GBC (P<0.001) and PRKAR1A copy gains in ICC (P=0.007). PTEN was frequently co-mutated with CTNNB1 (P<0.001). Unrelated to CTNNB1 mutations, nuclear beta-catenin was detected in 45% of tumors, among them in 5/6 hmGBC. We observed strong mRNA expression correlation of the two neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) with each other (Spearman's rho 0.59) and with the endothelin receptor (NRP2 rho 0.66; NRP2 rho 0.51), and between VEGFA and its receptors (FLT1 rho 0.49; KDR rho 0.45). All PIK3CA mutated tumors expressed endothelin 1 mRNA (P=0.010). Most tumors expressing nuclear beta-catenin were negative for VEGFC (P=0.009) and FLT4 (P=0.002) mRNA expression. In conclusion, we confirmed the presence of known genomic aberrations in BTC and different genotypes between BTC subsets. Novel findings are the coexistence of PI3K and WNT pathway gene alterations in BTC, their association with angiogenesis, and the hypermutated GBCs with HRR gene mutations, all of which may be considered for new treatment options in this difficult to treat disease.

AB Recent advances in the field of infectious disease diagnostics have given rise to a number of host- and pathogen-centered diagnostic approaches. Most diagnostic approaches in contemporary infectious disease focus on pathogen detection and characterization. Host-focused diagnostics have recently emerged and are based on detecting the activation of biological pathways that are highly specific to the type of infecting pathogen (e.g., viral, bacterial, protozoan, fungal). Although this progress is encouraging, it is unlikely that any single diagnostic platform will fully address the clinician's need for actionable data with short turnaround times in all settings.

AB Most mutations in cancer are rare, which complicates the identification of therapeutically significant mutations and thus limits the clinical impact of genomic profiling in patients with cancer. Here, we analyzed 24,592 cancers including 10,336 prospectively sequenced patients with advanced disease to identify mutant residues arising more frequently than expected in the absence of selection. We identified 1,165 statistically significant hotspot mutations of which 80% arose in 1 in 1,000 or fewer patients. Of 55 recurrent in-frame indels, we validated that novel AKT1 duplications induced pathway hyperactivation and conferred AKT inhibitor sensitivity. Cancer genes exhibit different rates of hotspot discovery with increasing sample size, with few approaching saturation. Consequently, 26% of all hotspots in therapeutically actionable oncogenes were novel. Upon matching a subset of affected patients directly to molecularly targeted therapy, we observed radiographic and clinical responses. Population-scale mutant allele discovery illustrates how the identification of driver mutations in cancer is far from complete.Significance: Our systematic computational, experimental, and clinical analysis of hotspot mutations in approximately 25,000 human cancers demonstrates that the long right tail of biologically and therapeutically significant mutant alleles is still incompletely characterized. Sharing prospective genomic data will accelerate hotspot identification, thereby expanding the reach of precision oncology in patients with cancer.

AB Device-detected atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) are frequently encountered in patients with no history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and represent a challenge for clinicians because patients with device-only documented AF have not been included in clinical trials of anticoagulants and other AF therapies. For patients with known history of AF, wireless continuous rhythm monitoring and rapidly acting oral anticoagulants offer the possibility of tailored anticoagulation in response to AHREs, with studies ongoing to evaluate the safety of this approach. This article provides an overview of current evidence on device-detected AHREs and evolving areas of investigation. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB AIMS: Advanced biliary tract carcinomas (ABC) are malignancies with limited effective therapies for advanced disease. There is little published evidence of outcomes of ABC patients participating in phase I clinical trials.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient characteristics, treatment details and outcomes of ABC patients treated at a dedicated phase I unit were captured and analysed from case and trial records.; RESULTS: In total, 123 ABC patients were included in the study, of which 48 patients participated in 41 different phase I trials; 75 (61%) did not participate due to rapid disease progression or patient choice. Molecular characterisation of tumours using a targeted panel was conducted in 15 (31%), yielding several potentially actionable mutations, including BRCA, PIK3CA, FGFR, AKT and PTEN loss. Of the 39 evaluable patients there was one exceptional responder. Eighteen (46%) other patients achieved stable disease as their best response, with a clinical benefit rate at 4 months of 10%. Treatment was generally well tolerated with grade 3 or 4 adverse events only observed in eight patients (17 %), of which six were drug related and led to trial discontinuation in one (3%), with no toxicity-related deaths.; CONCLUSION: Carefully selected ABC patients have been found to tolerate experimental phase I clinical trials without excess toxicity. The aggressive nature of this disease warrants consideration of early referral to a phase I unit. Future work will require comprehensive molecular profiling in an attempt to understand the biology underlying the exceptional responders and to match patients in real-time to targeted therapies.

AB Patient recruitment is widely recognized as a key determinant of success for clinical trials. Yet a substantial number of trials fail to reach recruitment goals-a situation that has important scientific, financial, ethical, and policy implications. Further, there are important effects on stakeholders who directly contribute to the trial including investigators, sponsors, and study participants. Despite efforts over multiple decades to identify and address barriers, recruitment challenges persist. To advance a more comprehensive approach to trial recruitment, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) convened a project team to examine the challenges and to issue actionable, evidence-based recommendations for improving recruitment planning that extend beyond common study-specific strategies. We describe our multi-stakeholder effort to develop a framework that delineates three areas essential to strategic recruitment planning efforts: (1) trial design and protocol development, (2) trial feasibility and site selection, and (3) communication. Our recommendations propose an upstream approach to recruitment planning that has the potential to produce greater impact and reduce downstream barriers. Additionally, we offer tools to help facilitate adoption of the recommendations. We hope that our framework and recommendations will serve as a guide for initial efforts in clinical trial recruitment planning irrespective of disease or intervention focus, provide a common basis for discussions in this area and generate targets for further analysis and continual improvement.

AB OBJECTIVE: There remain substantial gaps in implementation of evidence-based care in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in Australia, which contribute to high recurrent event rates. Improved translation of evidence into effective action is a key health-care priority. We engaged cardiovascular experts from across Australia to develop straightforward, easily actionable recommendations on key medications to use following ACS.; METHODS: An eight-person steering committee (SC) reviewed the published evidence and developed an initial set of statements to be developed into consensus recommendations using a modified Delphi technique. A panel of 21 expert cardiologists in the ACS field (including the SC) voted on their level of agreement with the statements using a 6 point Likert scale. Statements that did not reach consensus (≥80% agreement) were reviewed by the SC, modified as appropriate based on input from the panel and circulated for re-voting.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight statements were developed by the SC across six classes of medication: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering agents, aspirin, dual antiplatelet therapy, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta blockers and "other". Twenty-six recommendations were endorsed by the voting panel; two statements did not reach consensus.; CONCLUSIONS: Despite the extensive evidence base and detailed guidelines outlining best practice post ACS, there remain considerable gaps in translating these into everyday care. We used an internationally recognized technique to develop practical consensus recommendations on medical treatment following ACS. These simple, up-to-date recommendations aim to improve evidence-based medication use and thereby reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events for Australian patients with ACS.

AB Molecular analysis of potentially actionable mutations has become routine practice in oncological pathology. However, testing a wide range of oncogenes and mutations can be technically challenging because of limitations associated with tumor biopsy. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a potential tool for the noninvasive profiling of tumors. In this study, we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based test for the detection of clinically relevant mutations in ctDNA and evaluated the feasibility of using this ctDNA NGS-based assay as an alternative to tissue genotyping. Tissue and matched blood samples were obtained from 72 patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NGS-based testing was performed using plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples of all 72 patients as well as tumor DNA samples of 46 patients. Of the remaining 26 patients, tDNA was tested by amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) because of insufficient tissue sample or quality for NGS. Of the 46 patients who had tDNA and cfDNA NGS performed, we found 20 patients were concordant between tDNA and ctDNA alterations and 21 sample pairs were discordant because of additional alterations found in tDNA. Considering all clinically relevant alterations, the concordance rate between tDNA and ctDNA alterations was 54.9% with a sensitivity of 53.2% and a specificity of 75.0%. Our findings demonstrate that targeted NGS using cfDNA is a feasible approach for rapid and accurate identification of actionable mutations in patients with advanced NSCLC, and may provide a safe and robust alternative approach to tissue biopsy. © 2018 The Authors Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family tyrosine kinases by chromosomal rearrangement has been shown to drive a wide range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. TRK fusions are actionable targets as evidenced by recent clinical trial results in solid tumors. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, CNS-active, highly potent, and selective kinase inhibitor against TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK kinase activities. Here, we demonstrate that TRK kinase inhibition by entrectinib selectively targets preclinical models of TRK fusion-driven hematologic malignancies. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene, entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in vitro with subnanomolar IC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein and its downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In animal models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression that was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with TRK fusion-driven AML and other hematologic malignancies.

AB Metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) is invariably fatal, usually within a year of diagnosis. There are currently no effective therapies, and clinical studies employing kinase inhibitors have so far demonstrated limited success. This is despite common activating mutations in GNAQ/11 genes, which trigger signalling pathways that might predispose tumours to a variety of targeted drugs. In this study, we have profiled kinome expression network dynamics in various human ocular melanomas. We uncovered a shared transcriptional profile in human primary UM samples and across a variety of experimental cell-based models. The poor overall response of UM cells to FDA-approved kinase inhibitors contrasted with much higher sensitivity to the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, a broad transcriptional repressor. Mechanistically, we identified a repressed FOXM1-dependent kinase subnetwork in JQ1-exposed cells that contained multiple cell cycle-regulated protein kinases. Consistently, we demonstrated vulnerability of UM cells to inhibitors of mitotic protein kinases within this network, including the investigational PLK1 inhibitor BI6727. We conclude that analysis of kinome-wide signalling network dynamics has the potential to reveal actionable drug targets and inhibitors of potential therapeutic benefit for UM patients. © 2017 The Authors.

AB Many individuals at risk of streptococcal infection respond poorly to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine Pneumovax 23. Identification of actionable pathways able to enhance Pneumovax responsiveness is highly relevant. We investigated the contribution of the extracellular adenosine pathway regulated by the ecto-nucleotidase CD73 in Pneumovax-induced antibody responses. Using gene-targeted mice, we demonstrated that CD73-or A2a adenosine receptor deficiency significantly delayed isotype switching. Nevertheless, CD73- or A2aR- deficient adult mice ultimately produced antigen-specific IgG3 and controlled Streptococcus pneumoniae infection as efficiently as wild type (WT) mice. Compared to adults, young WT mice failed to control S. pneumoniae infection after vaccination and this was associated with lower levels of CD73 on innate B cells. We hypothesized that pharmacological activation of A2a receptor may improve Pneumovax 23 immunization in young WT mice. Remarkably, administration of the A2a adenosine receptor agonist CGS 21680 significantly increased IgG3 responses and significantly enhanced survival after S. pneumoniae challenge. Our study thus suggests that pharmacological activation of the A2a adenosine receptor could improve the efficacy of Pneumovax 23 vaccination in individuals at risk of streptococcal infection.

AB BACKGROUND: Cancer information is of critical interest to the public. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) offers a series of comprehensive patient guidelines on the management of the most common cancer diagnoses. This study was aimed at assessing the health literacy demands of NCCN patient guidelines for the most common malignancies in the United States.; METHODS: The American Cancer Society's most common malignancies by annual incidence in the United States and their corresponding NCCN patient guidelines were identified. Four validated tools were used to evaluate literacy levels: 1) the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, 2) the Peter Mosenthal and Irwin Kirsch readability formula (PMOSE/IKIRSCH), 3) the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), and 4) the Clear Communication Index from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).; RESULTS: The average reading grade level was 10.3, which was higher than the recommended 6th-grade level. The average PMOSE/IKIRSCH score was 11; this corresponded to moderate complexity and required some college-level education for interpretation. Only 1 tool, the PEMAT, yielded scores above the benchmarks for high-quality materials. The PEMAT's understandability, actionability, and overall scores were 94%, 83%, and 91%, respectively. The average CDC index was 85%, which was below the recommended 90% for an appropriate health literacy demand.; CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the assessment indicates high demand scores for the readability and complexity of the NCCN patient guidelines and thus that the materials are not quite suitable for the general US adult population. Further input from patient focus groups to address appropriateness and usefulness is critical. Cancer 2018;124:769-74. © 2017 American Cancer Society. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

AB The U.S. Department of the Interior Climate Science Centers (CSCs) work with natural and cultural resource managers and scientists to gather information and build tools needed to help fish, wildlife, and ecosystems adapt to the impacts of climate change. The CSCs prioritize the delivery of actionable science products (e.g., synthesized scientific information, maps, decision support tools, etc.) that are focused on key management priorities and co-produced by teams of scientists and managers. In the specific case of the Northwest CSC, we have been successful at promoting and supporting the co-production of actionable climate science at the individual project level, but it has been more difficult to replicate this success at the regional program level. Here we identify the most significant challenges in satisfying this mandate and propose the creation of a Science Advisory Panel to provide improved interface between resource managers and scientists engaged with the Northwest CSC.

AB In January 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally established the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) to streamline the development of cancer therapies by uniting experts from FDA product centers to conduct expedited review of drugs, biologics, and devices. In May 2017, the FDA approved a cancer treatment based on a biomarker, without regard to the tumor's site, by granting accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors that have the microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient biomarker. We describe here the OCE's role in this first site-agnostic approval and OCE programs for further advancement of oncology-related regulatory science and policy. In addition, the FDA's four expedited review programs that enable transformative therapies to reach patients with life-threatening malignancies earlier in the development process are key to the continued rapid development of safe and effective therapies for patients with few or no other treatment options. These changes at FDA are taking place in the context of recent progress in the understanding of the genetic and immunologic foundations of cancer, resulting in the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The traditional system of phased clinical trials has evolved as early trials of breakthrough therapies use expansion cohorts in a process known as seamless drug development. Increasingly, FDA approvals of targeted therapies are likely to have contemporaneous approvals of companion diagnostics to identify patients whose cancers harbor actionable abnormalities. Impact statement This publication describes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) first site-agnostic oncology drug approval, a landmark event in the history of cancer drug development. The role of the FDA's newly established Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) in this approval is described, as are several OCE programs to advance excellence in regulatory science in the era of precision medicine. Also provided is an overview of FDA's expedited drug review programs, which are important to the continued acceleration of therapeutics development for patients with life-threatening diseases and few or no other treatment options.

AB This qualitative interview study brings the voices of 27 public health leaders, health communication experts, and artists who work in public health in Uganda together to articulate the principles and practices that make the country a shining example of effective, evidence-based use of the arts for health communication. The specific aim of the study was to identify best practices, theoretical foundations, and other factors that contribute to the success of arts-based health communication campaigns in Uganda. The study presents four primary themes related to use of the arts for health communication in Uganda: (1) the arts empower health communication; (2) the arts engage people emotionally; (3) effective programs are highly structured; and (4) professionalism is critical to program effectiveness. The findings suggest that the arts humanize, clarify, and empower health communication. The arts can attract attention and engage target populations, reduce hierarchical divisions and tensions that can challenge communication between health professionals and community members, make concepts clearer and more personally and culturally relevant, and communicate at an emotional level wherein concepts can be embodied and made actionable. The findings articulate why and how the arts are an effective means for health communication and can guide best practices.

AB PURPOSE: Modern cardiac implantable devices provide diagnostic information on several physiological variables which are associated with worsening heart failure, creating an opportunity for early intervention to prevent heart failure symptoms and hospitalizations. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and workload of a remote monitoring (RM) workflow algorithm which leverages intrathoracic impedance and other device diagnostics.; METHODS: In our RM workflow a team of expert nurses was responsible for continuity of care, direct relationship with patients and implementation of a specific protocol to evaluate RM alerts and to limit unnecessary resource consumption. Each patient was univocally assigned to a reference nurse. End points were diagnostic accuracy, healthcare utilization, defined as any hospital admission, and actionability of alerts, defined as medication change or other clinical action.; RESULTS: One-hundred twenty-six consecutive patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator were followed for a median time of 23 months. Out of 2176 remote transmissions, 893 (41%) in 111 patients (88.1%) showed clinically relevant events triggered by 574 alerts [2.2 (95% confidence interval = 2.0-2.4) per patient per year]. Among 309 alerts with intrathoracic impedance crossing, heart failure deterioration was confirmed in 116 (37.5%). Clinical actions followed 76/116 (65.5%) true heart failure alerts and 17/193 (8.8%) false-positive alerts (P < 0.001). In particular, drug therapy change followed 72/116 (62.1%) true heart failure alerts and 15/193 (7.8%) false-positive alerts (P < 0.001). Healthcare utilization occurred in 65.5% true heart failure alerts and in 24.9% false-positive alerts (P < 0.001).; CONCLUSION: A dedicated workflow algorithm results in more focused clinical surveillance leading to prompt detection and treatment of acute heart failure events without wasting healthcare resource.

AB Children and adolescents with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk for wide-ranging behavioral, developmental, and cognitive impairments and decreased quality of life. To date, no psychosocial screening tool has been developed to quickly assess the symptoms that 1) can be addressed during routine medical appointments in children with NF1, 2) can produce interpretable and actionable results, 3) can be integrated into medical care, and 4) can quickly identify patients at risk in order to better address that the provision of appropriate care are available. This study was conducted to test the overall usability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and symptom checklist and concordance of DT ratings between pediatric patients, their caregivers and medical providers. Eighty youth (ages 7-21) living with NF1 completed the DT and an accompanying checklist. The findings of this study suggest the DT and symptom checklist was acceptable and feasible to complete in a clinic setting. A small subset reported high distress that required further assessment and intervention. Significant discordance between distress ratings of caregivers and children and healthcare providers was also found. Overall, the DT and accompanying symptom checklist provide important information to identify the presence of distress and contextualize the child's distress but is limited by not assessing whether these symptoms interfere with the child's daily life.

AB Multi-gene panel testing has expanded the genetic information available to cancer patients. The objective was to assess provider behaviors and attitudes and patient knowledge and attitudes towards genetic counseling and testing. An online survey was distributed to Society of Gynecologic Oncology members and a written questionnaire was administered to patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer at a tertiary care referral center. Most of the 233 (18% response rate) provider respondents were gynecologic oncologists. Access to a genetic counselor was reported by 87% of providers and 55% deferred all testing to genetic counselors. Of 53 ovarian cancer patient respondents, two-thirds had previously seen a genetic counselor or undergone testing. Patients' attitudes about genetic counseling and/or testing were favorable with respect to themselves (70-81%) and their family members (94%). Less than 25% of patients indicated worrying about health care discrimination, lack of privacy, or high cost. Seventy-seven percent of patients demonstrated a desire to obtain genetic information even if the results were not currently actionable, and 20% of providers stated they test for only those genes with guideline-supported actionable results. Provider practice differences were identified in screening and prevention strategies for patients with deleterious non-BRCA mutations and variants of uncertain significance. The variation in clinical interpretation of results associated with poorly defined cancer risks signals a need for more comprehensive training and guidelines to ensure access to evidence-based care.

AB BACKGROUND: Online health information is particularly important for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, where lifestyle changes are recommended until risk becomes high enough to warrant pharmacological intervention. Online information is abundant, but the quality is often poor and many people do not have adequate health literacy to access, understand, and use it effectively.; OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to review and evaluate the suitability of online CVD risk calculators for use by low health literate consumers in terms of clinical validity, understandability, and actionability.; METHODS: This systematic review of public websites from August to November 2016 used evaluation of clinical validity based on a high-risk patient profile and assessment of understandability and actionability using Patient Education Material Evaluation Tool for Print Materials.; RESULTS: A total of 67 unique webpages and 73 unique CVD risk calculators were identified. The same high-risk patient profile produced widely variable CVD risk estimates, ranging from as little as 3% to as high as a 43% risk of a CVD event over the next 10 years. One-quarter (25%) of risk calculators did not specify what model these estimates were based on. The most common clinical model was Framingham (44%), and most calculators (77%) provided a 10-year CVD risk estimate. The calculators scored moderately on understandability (mean score 64%) and poorly on actionability (mean score 19%). The absolute percentage risk was stated in most (but not all) calculators (79%), and only 18% included graphical formats consistent with recommended risk communication guidelines.; CONCLUSIONS: There is a plethora of online CVD risk calculators available, but they are not readily understandable and their actionability is poor. Entering the same clinical information produces widely varying results with little explanation. Developers need to address actionability as well as clinical validity and understandability to improve usefulness to consumers with low health literacy. ©Carissa Bonner, Michael Anthony Fajardo, Samuel Hui, Renee Stubbs, Lyndal Trevena.

AB The current heart failure clinical trial environment is strained by increasing complexity and cost, regulatory requirements, competing demands on stakeholders, implementation challenges, and decreasing patient and investigator participation. To begin the process of developing potentially effective strategies and tactics, stakeholders including patients; investigators; academic leaders; pharmaceutical and device industry representatives; society representatives; third-party payers; and government representatives from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services convened in March of 2017. This paper summarizes the discussions, outlines current challenges and actionable opportunities, and makes targeted recommendations to achieve the goals of improving efficiency in clinical trials and speeding the development of effective heart failure therapies, including the formation of an organized Heart Failure Collaboratory.

AB BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in using verbal autopsy to produce nationally representative population-level estimates of causes of death. However, the burden of processing a large quantity of surveys collected with paper and pencil has been a barrier to scaling up verbal autopsy surveillance. Direct electronic data capture has been used in other large-scale surveys and can be used in verbal autopsy as well, to reduce time and cost of going from collected data to actionable information.; METHODS: We collected verbal autopsy interviews using paper and pencil and using electronic tablets at two sites, and measured the cost and time required to process the surveys for analysis. From these cost and time data, we extrapolated costs associated with conducting large-scale surveillance with verbal autopsy.; RESULTS: We found that the median time between data collection and data entry for surveys collected on paper and pencil was approximately 3 months. For surveys collected on electronic tablets, this was less than 2 days. For small-scale surveys, we found that the upfront costs of purchasing electronic tablets was the primary cost and resulted in a higher total cost. For large-scale surveys, the costs associated with data entry exceeded the cost of the tablets, so electronic data capture provides both a quicker and cheaper method of data collection.; CONCLUSIONS: As countries increase verbal autopsy surveillance, it is important to consider the best way to design sustainable systems for data collection. Electronic data capture has the potential to greatly reduce the time and costs associated with data collection. For long-term, large-scale surveillance required by national vital statistical systems, electronic data capture reduces costs and allows data to be available sooner.

AB Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with negative health consequences for mothers and their infants. Data on the vitamin D status of pregnant women in Switzerland are scarce. A three-centre study was conducted in the obstetric departments of Zurich, Bellinzona and Samedan (Switzerland) to investigate the prevalence and determinants of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)<50 nmol/l) in 3rd-trimester pregnant women living in Switzerland (n 305), and the correlation between 25(OH)D in pregnant women and their offspring at birth (n 278). Demographic and questionnaire data were used to explore the determinants of vitamin D deficiency. Median concentration of serum 25(OH)D in the third trimester of pregnancy was 46·0 nmol/l (1st-3rd quartiles: 30·5-68·5), representing a 53·4 % prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. 25(OH)D levels in the umbilcal cord blood (median: 50·0 nmol/l; 1st-3rd quartiles: 31·0-76·6) strongly correlated with mothers' serum 25(OH)D (Spearman's correlation rho=0·79, P<0·001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that significant determinants of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women were centre of study, country of origin, season of delivery and vitamin D supplement intake. Near-term BMI, skin colour, use of sunscreen and mothers' education, although each not individually significant, collectively improved the ability of the model to explain vitamin D status. Low vitamin D levels were common in this sample of pregnant women and their newborns' cord blood. Vitamin D supplement intake was the most actionable determinant of vitamin D status, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy should receive more attention in clinical practice.

AB OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that routine daily transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) transmissions can accurately detect supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in asymptomatic infants and/or assuage parental concerns rather than being used solely to diagnose arrhythmias.; STUDY DESIGN: Single center, retrospective chart review of 60 patients with fetal or infant SVT prescribed TTM for at least 30 days, January 2010-September 2016. Patients were excluded if initial SVT was not documented, was perioperative, was atrial flutter/fibrillation, or chaotic atrial tachycardia. Categorical variables expressed as mean±SD. Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation, and Fisher exact tests were used for continuous and categorical variables respectively.; RESULTS: Sixty patients were included. There were 2688 TTM transmissions received from 55 of 60 patients over 61.1±66.7 days (0.73±0.65 TTM/patient/days). Routine asymptomatic TTM transmissions revealed actionable findings in 5 of 2801 TTM transmissions sent by 5 patients (8.3%). No patient presented in shock or died. Forty-five of 2688 TTM transmissions were sent for parental concerns/symptoms in 16 patients (25.8%) with findings of normal sinus rhythm in 37 of 45 TTM transmissions and SVT in 8 of 45 TTM transmissions. Symptomatic actionable findings were more likely sent by patients discharged on class I or III antiarrhythmics (95% CI=11.5%-68.3%, P=.004) and patients with prolonged initial hospitalizations (95% CI=6.98%-59.7%, P=.01). Flecainide was discontinued in 1 patient after widened QRS was noted on routine TTM.; CONCLUSIONS: TTM accurately diagnose asymptomatic recurrent SVT in neonates and infants before they develop signs of congestive heart failure or shock and is helpful for recurrent SVT management.

AB BACKGROUND: The major challenge for treating non-squamous (non-Sq) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without actionable biomarkers is the actual selection of proper treatment, weighing expected clinical outcomes and safety profile.; METHODS: Consecutive non-Sq NSCLC patients were treated with platinum-pemetrexed (PP) doublets in clinical practice. Subgroup analyses were conducted in patients treated with standard (s)PP and modified (m)PP doublets (because of age, performance status, and/or comorbidities) and in patients treated with cisplatin-based and carboplatin-based PP doublets. Activity, efficacy, safety, and toxicities were evaluated.; RESULTS: From November 2009 to April 2017, 111 patients were treated: 87 (78.4%) with sPP and 24 (21.6%) with mPP; 76 (68.5%) with cisplatin-based and 35 (31.5%) with carboplatin-based regimens. The objective response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (PFS), and median overall survival (OS) were 49.0%, 7, and 13months in the entire patient population, respectively. We found no significant differences in ORR, median PFS, and median OS between sPP and mPP. Cisplatin-based PP showed higher ORR (53.7%) versus carboplatin-based PP (38.7%) and longer PFS (7 vs. 6months; P=0.028) and OS (18 vs. 11months; P=0.006). We confirm that carboplatin has a better toxicity profile than cisplatin. The received dose-intensities were ~80% of standard full doses.; CONCLUSIONS: Accurate management allowed us to treat the majority of advanced non-Sq NSCLC patients with PP combination therapy without significant differences in ORR, median PFS, and median OS. Even considering the selection bias, our data seems to confirm the greater effectiveness of cisplatin-based over carboplatin-based regimens. © 2017 The Authors.

AB Little evidence is available to guide returning genomic results in children without medical indication for sequencing. Professional guidelines for returning information on adult-onset conditions are conflicting. The goal of this study was to provide preliminary information on parental attitudes and expectations about returning medically actionable genomic results in children who have been sequenced as part of a population biobank.Four focus groups of parents with a child enrolled in a population biobank were conducted. A deliberative engagement format included education about professional guidelines and ethical issues around returning results to children. Parents were presented two scenarios where their healthy child has a pathogenic variant for: (a) a medically actionable childhood condition; (b) a hereditary cancer syndrome with no medical management until adulthood. Thematic analysis was conducted on verbatim transcripts. Regardless of the scenario, parents stated that the genomic information was important, was like other unexpected medical information, and disclosure should be tailored to the child's age and result. Parents wanted the results in their child's medical record. Reasons for learning adult-onset results in their healthy children included to prepare their child for necessary medical action in adulthood. Parents also provided suggestions for program design. This preliminary evidence suggests that parents desire genomic results and expect to use this information to protect their child's health. More empirical research on psychosocial adjustment to such information with continued engagement of parents and children is needed to further inform how to best support families in the communication and use of genomic information. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2018.

AB Metabolic disorders present a public health challenge of staggering proportions. In diabetes, there is an urgent need to better understand disease heterogeneity, clinical trajectories, and related comorbidities. A pressing and timely question is whether we are ready for precision medicine in diabetes. Some biological insights that have emerged during the last decade have already been used to direct clinical decision making, especially in monogenic forms of diabetes. However, much work is necessary to integrate high-dimensional explorations into complex disease architectures, less penetrant biological alterations, and broader phenotypes, such as type 2 diabetes. In addition, for precision medicine to take hold in diabetes, reproducibility, interpretability, and actionability remain key guiding objectives. In this review, we examine how mounting data sets generated during the last decade to understand biological variability are now inspiring new venues to clarify diabetes nosology and ultimately translate findings into more effective prevention and treatment strategies. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB Radiotherapy uses high doses of energy to eradicate cancer cells and control tumors. Various treatment schedules have been developed and tried in clinical trials, yet significant obstacles remain to improving the radiotherapy fractionation. Genetic and non-genetic cellular diversity within tumors can lead to different radiosensitivity among cancer cells that can affect radiation treatment outcome. We propose a minimal mathematical model to study the effect of tumor heterogeneity and repair in different radiation treatment schedules. We perform stochastic and deterministic simulations to estimate model parameters using available experimental data. Our results suggest that gross tumor volume reduction is insufficient to control the disease if a fraction of radioresistant cells survives therapy. If cure cannot be achieved, protocols should balance volume reduction with minimal selection for radioresistant cells. We show that the most efficient treatment schedule is dependent on biology and model parameter values and, therefore, emphasize the need for careful tumor-specific model calibration before clinically actionable conclusions can be drawn.

AB BACKGROUND: Hospitals are subject to federal financial penalties for excessive 30-day hospital readmissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Prospectively identifying patients hospitalized with AMI at high risk for readmission could help prevent 30-day readmissions by enabling targeted interventions. However, the performance of AMI-specific readmission risk prediction models is unknown.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched the published literature through March 2017 for studies of risk prediction models for 30-day hospital readmission among adults with AMI. We identified 11 studies of 18 unique risk prediction models across diverse settings primarily in the United States, of which 16 models were specific to AMI. The median overall observed all-cause 30-day readmission rate across studies was 16.3% (range, 10.6%-21.0%). Six models were based on administrative data; 4 on electronic health record data; 3 on clinical hospital data; and 5 on cardiac registry data. Models included 7 to 37 predictors, of which demographics, comorbidities, and utilization metrics were the most frequently included domains. Most models, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services AMI administrative model, had modest discrimination (median C statistic, 0.65; range, 0.53-0.79). Of the 16 reported AMI-specific models, only 8 models were assessed in a validation cohort, limiting generalizability. Observed risk-stratified readmission rates ranged from 3.0% among the lowest-risk individuals to 43.0% among the highest-risk individuals, suggesting good risk stratification across all models.; CONCLUSIONS: Current AMI-specific readmission risk prediction models have modest predictive ability and uncertain generalizability given methodological limitations. No existing models provide actionable information in real time to enable early identification and risk-stratification of patients with AMI before hospital discharge, a functionality needed to optimize the potential effectiveness of readmission reduction interventions. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB Recently, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommended the return of actionable secondary findings detected from clinical sequencing. The reported frequency of secondary findings in Asian populations were highly variable and it is unclear whether the uniformity in coverage offered by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) may impact the estimate. In this analysis, we aimed to refine the rate of secondary findings on East Asians through a large-scale WGS study. We classified 1256 protein-altering or splicing variants of the 59 actionable genes detected from WGS of 954 East Asians in strict accordance with the ACMG and the Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. A total of 21 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in 24 of the 954 East Asian genomes with an estimate of 2.5% of East Asians carrying actionable variants. Although the overall estimate of secondary findings was consistent with those reported for non-East Asian ethnicities, genetic and allelic heterogeneity was observed. WGS offers a wider breadth of coverage over WES, which highlights the need to further investigate the variable sensitivity of WES and WGS in the detection of secondary findings. Identifying secondary findings in populations underrepresented in previous genetic literature might improve variant interpretation and has a profound impact on local decision-making with regard to the cost-effectiveness of returning the secondary findings from clinical sequencing.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical utility of an algorithm-based decision tool designed to assess risk associated with opioid use. Specifically, we sought to assess how physicians were using the profile in patient care and how its use affected patient outcomes.; Patients and methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted to assess the utility of precision medicine testing in 5,397 patients across 100 clinics in the USA. Using a patent-protected, validated algorithm combining specific genetic risk factors with phenotypic traits, patients were categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk patients for opioid abuse. Physicians who ordered precision medicine testing were asked to complete patient evaluations and document their actions, decisions, and perceptions regarding the utility of the precision medicine tests. The patient outcomes associated with each treatment action were carefully documented.; Results: Physicians used the profile to guide treatment decisions for over half of the patients. Of those, guided treatment decisions for 24.5% of the patients were opioid related, including changing the opioid prescribed, starting an opioid, or titrating a patient off the opioid. Treatment guidance was strongly influenced by profile-predicted opioid use disorder (OUD) risk. Most importantly, patients whose physicians used the profile to guide opioid-related treatment decisions had improved clinical outcomes, including better pain management by medication adjustments, with an average pain decrease of 3.4 points on a scale of 1-10.; Conclusion: Patients whose physicians used the profile to guide opioid-related treatment decisions had improved clinical outcomes, as measured by decreased pain levels resulting from better pain management with prescribed medications. The clinical utility of the profile is twofold. It provides clinically actionable recommendations that can be used to 1) prevent OUD through limiting initial opioid prescriptions and 2) reduce pain in patients at low risk of developing OUD.

AB High-grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common malignant brain tumors in the pediatric population and account for a large subset of all pediatric central nervous system neoplasms. The management of pediatric HGG continues to be challenging, with poor outcome in many cases despite aggressive treatments. Consequently, parallel research efforts have been focused on identifying the underlying genetic and biological basis of pediatric HGG in order to more clearly define prognostic subgroups for treatment stratification as well as identify new treatment targets. These cutting-edge advances have revolutionized pediatric neuro-oncology and have revealed novel oncogenic vulnerabilities that are being therapeutically leveraged. Promising treatments - including pathway-targeting small molecules as well as epigenetic therapy - are being evaluated in clinical trials, and recent genomic discoveries in rare glioma subgroups have led to the identification of additional new potentially-actionable alterations. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the molecular characterization of pediatric HGG in correlation to the revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification, as well as provides an overview of some targeted treatment approaches in the modern clinical management of high-grade gliomas.

AB The goal of the initiative was to evaluate the impact of an innovative practice model on identification of unmet vaccination needs and vaccination rates. This was accomplished through a prospective, multisite, observational study in 8 community pharmacy practices with adults receiving an influenza vaccine with a documented vaccination forecast review from October 22, 2015 through March 22, 2016. When patients presented for influenza vaccinations, pharmacists utilized immunization information systems (IIS) data at the point of care to identify unmet vaccination needs, educate patients, and improve vaccination rates. The main outcome measures were the number of vaccination forecast reviews, patients educated, unmet vaccination needs identified and resolved, and vaccines administered. Pharmacists reviewed vaccination forecasts generated by clinical decision-support technology based on patient information documented in the IIS for 1080 patients receiving influenza vaccinations. The vaccination forecasts predicted there were 1566 additional vaccinations due at the time patients were receiving the influenza vaccine. Pharmacist assessments identified 36 contraindications and 196 potential duplications, leaving a net of 1334 unmet vaccination needs eligible for vaccination. In all, 447 of the 1334 unmet vaccinations needs were resolved during the 6-month study period, and the remainder of patients received information about their vaccination needs and recommendations to follow up for their vaccinations. Integration of streamlined principle-centered processes of care in immunization practices that allow pharmacists to utilize actionable point-of-care data resulted in identification of unmet vaccination needs, education of patients about their vaccination needs, a 41.4% increase in the number of vaccines administered, and significant improvements in routinely recommended adult vaccination rates.

AB Compared with people in other developed countries, Americans live shorter lives, have more disease and disability, and lag on most population health measures. Recent research suggests that this poor comparative performance is primarily driven by profound local place-based disparities. Several initiatives successfully used sub-county life expectancy estimates to identify geographic disparities, generate widespread interest, and catalyze multisector actions. To explore the feasibility of scaling these efforts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists initiated a multiphase project - the Sub-County Assessment of Life Expectancy. Phase I participants reviewed the literature, assessed and identified appropriate tools, calculated locally relevant estimates, and developed methodological guidance. Phase I results suggest that most state and local health departments will be able to calculate actionable sub-county life expectancy estimates despite varying resources, expertise, and population sizes, densities, and geographies. To accelerate widespread scaling, we describe several successful case examples, identify user-friendly validated tools, and provide practical tips that resulted from lessons learned.

AB Advances from immuno-oncology (IO) are changing the standard of care of many types of cancer, and the paradigm of cancer treatments and drug development is being rewritten on a regular basis. Moreover, an unprecedented number of new investigational agents and companies are entering the field of IO. As such, it has become challenging for oncology physicians conducting clinical trials, industry veterans developing IO drugs, and even regulators reviewing novel IO agents to keep track of the rapidly evolving landscape. To help the key stake holders in the field understand the latest IO landscape, we sought to present an unbiased, neutral, scientifically curated, and timely updated analysis of all the current IO agents in clinical development and the clinical trials testing these agents. We based our analyses on information collected from numerous trusted and publicly available sources. We have developed two databases. One database tracks 2004 IO agents (940 in clinical stage and 1064 in preclinical stage) against 303 targets, from 864 companies; the other tracks 3042 active clinical trials of these agents with a target enrollment of 577 076 patients. This report provides key analyses of these data. Furthermore, we will discuss a number of important and actionable trends in the current IO landscape: a large number of companies developing agents against the same IO targets; a rapid increase in the number of anti-PD-1/L1 combination studies, many of which are testing the same combinations and following inefficient patterns; and a significant increase in the number of small, investigator-initiated studies. For each of the findings, we speculate the causes and discuss a few initiatives that aim to address some of these challenges. Finally, by making these landscape analyses available, we aspire to inform the cancer community as they seek to strive for efficiencies and innovation while avoiding duplication. © The Author 2017.

AB Background: Targeted capture sequencing can potentially facilitate precision medicine, but the feasibility of this approach in gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies is unknown.; Patients and methods: The FOrMAT (Feasibility of a Molecular Characterisation Approach to Treatment) study was a feasibility study enrolling patients with advanced GI malignancies from February 2014 to November 2015. Targeted capture sequencing (mainly using archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic/resection samples) was carried out to detect mutations, copy number variations and translocations in up to 46 genes which had prognostic/predictive significance or were targets in current/upcoming clinical trials.; Results: Of the 222 patients recruited, 215 patients (96.8%) had available tissue samples, 125 patients (56.3%) had ≥16 genes successfully sequenced and 136 patients (61.2%) had ≥1 genes successfully sequenced. Sample characteristics influenced the proportion of successfully sequenced samples, e.g. tumour type (colorectal 70.9%, biliary 52.6%, oesophagogastric 50.7%, pancreas 27.3%, P=0.002), tumour cellularity (high versus low: 78.3% versus 13.3%, P≤0.001), tumour content (high versus low: 78.6% versus 27.3%, P=0.001) and type of sample (resection versus biopsy: 82.4% versus 47.6%, P≤0.001). Currently, actionable alterations were detected in 90 (40.5%) of the 222 patients recruited (66% of the 136 patients sequenced) and 2 patients subsequently received a targeted therapy. The most frequently detected currently actionable alterations were mutations in KRAS, BRAF, TP53 and PIK3CA. For the 205 patients with archival samples, the median time to obtain sequencing results was 18.9weeks, including a median of 4.9weeks for sample retrieval and 5.1weeks for sequencing.; Conclusions: Targeted sequencing detected actionable alterations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, but tissue characteristics are of critical importance in determining sequencing success. Routine molecular profiling of GI tumours outside of clinical trials is not an effective use of healthcare resources unless more targeted drugs become available.; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02112357. © The Author 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) survivors have reduced long-term survival compared to the general population. Identifying parameters at ICU discharge that are associated with poor long-term outcomes may prove useful in targeting an at-risk population. The main objective of the study was to identify clinical and biological determinants of death in the year following ICU discharge.; METHODS: FROG-ICU was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study of ICU survivors followed 1year after discharge, including 21 medical, surgical or mixed ICUs in France and Belgium. All consecutive patients admitted to intensive care with a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasoactive drug support for more than 24h following ICU admission and discharged from ICU were included. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 1year after ICU discharge. Clinical and biological parameters on ICU discharge were measured, including the circulating cardiovascular biomarkers N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitive troponin I, bioactive-adrenomedullin and soluble-ST2. Socioeconomic status was assessed using a validated deprivation index (FDep).; RESULTS: Of 1570 patients discharged alive from the ICU, 333 (21%) died over the following year. Multivariable analysis identified age, comorbidity, red blood cell transfusion, ICU length of stay and abnormalities in common clinical factors at the time of ICU discharge (low systolic blood pressure, temperature, total protein, platelet and white cell count) as independent factors associated with 1-year mortality. Elevated biomarkers of cardiac and vascular failure independently associated with 1-year death when they are added to multivariable model, with an almost 3-fold increase in the risk of death when combined (adjusted odds ratio 2.84 (95% confidence interval 1.73-4.65), p<0.001).; CONCLUSIONS: The FROG-ICU study identified, at the time of ICU discharge, potentially actionable clinical and biological factors associated with poor long-term outcome after ICU discharge. Those factors may guide discharge planning and directed interventions.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01367093 . Registered on 6 June 2011.

AB The complex network of the tissue system, in both pre-neoplastic tissues and tumors, demonstrates the need for a systems biology approach to cancer pathology, in which quantification of key tissue system processes is combined with informatics tools to produce actionable scores to aid clinical decision-making. A systems biology approach to cancer pathology enables integration of key system features that are relevant to diagnoses, patient outcomes, and responses to therapies. Key tissue system features relevant to cancer pathology include molecular and morphologic abnormalities in epithelia, cellular changes in the stroma such as immune infiltrates, and relationships between components of the system, such as interactions and spatial relationships between epithelial and stromal components, and also between specific immune cell subsets. Here, we describe a method for objective quantification of multiple epithelial and stromal biomarkers in the context of tissue architecture to generate a high dimensional tissue profile that can be used to build multivariable predictive models for cancer pathology.

AB Microbiomes convoy human life in countless ways. They are an essential part of the human body and interact with its host in countless ways. Currently, extensive microbiome analyses assessing the microbiomes' composition and functions based on sequencing information are still far away from being routine analyses due to the complexity of applied techniques and data analysis, their time demand as well as high costs. With the growing demand for on-time community assessment and monitoring of its dynamic behavior with high resolution, alternative high-throughput methods such as microbial community flow cytometry come into focus. Our flow cytometric approach provides single-cell based high-dimensional data by using only three parameters but for every cell in a system which is enough to characterize whole communities' attributes with high acuity over time. To interpret such complex cytometric time-series data, novel concepts are required. We provide a workflow which is applicable for easy-to-use handling and measurement of microbiomes. Drawing inspiration from macro-ecology, in which a rich set of concepts has been developed for describing population dynamics, we interpret huge sets of community single cell data in an intuitive and actionable way using a series of bioinformatics tools which we either developed or adapted from sequence based evaluation approaches for the interpretation of single cell data. The developed evaluation pipeline tests for e.g. ecological measures such as community assembly, functioning, and evolution. We also addressed the meta-community-concept which is a well acknowledged idea in macro-ecology on how interconnected communities perform. The last concept discusses stability which is a metrics of paramount importance. A fast quantification of stability properties may not only detect disturbances and their impact on the organisms but also allow for on-time microbiome treatment. The workflow's immanent ability to support high temporal sample densities below bacterial generation times provides new insight into the ecology of microbiomes and may also provide access to community control for microbiome based health management. The future developments will facilitate cytometric fingerprinting for human routine diagnostics to be as simple and meaningful as a blood count today. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB Natural microbial communities affect human life in countless ways, ranging from global biogeochemical cycles to the treatment of wastewater and health via the human microbiome. In order to probe, monitor, and eventually control these communities, fast detection and evaluation methods are required. In order to facilitate rapid community analysis and monitor a community's dynamic behavior with high resolution, we here apply community flow cytometry, which provides single-cell-based high-dimensional data characterizing communities with high acuity over time. To interpret time series data, we draw inspiration from macroecology, in which a rich set of concepts has been developed for describing population dynamics. We focus on the stability paradigm as a promising candidate to interpret such data in an intuitive and actionable way and present a rapid workflow to monitor stability properties of complex microbial ecosystems. Based on single-cell data, we compute the stability properties resistance, resilience, displacement speed, and elasticity. For resilience, we also introduce a method which can be implemented for continuous online community monitoring. The proposed workflow was tested in a long-term continuous reactor experiment employing both an artificial and a complex microbial community, which were exposed to identical short-term disturbances. The computed stability properties uncovered the superior stability of the complex community and demonstrated the global applicability of the protocol to any microbiome. The workflow is able to support high temporal sample densities below bacterial generation times. This may provide new opportunities to unravel unknown ecological paradigms of natural microbial communities, with applications to environmental, biotechnological, and health-related microbiomes. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities drive many processes which affect human well-being directly, as in the human microbiome, or indirectly, as in natural environments or in biotechnological applications. Due to their complexity, their dynamics over time is difficult to monitor, and current sequence-based approaches are limited with respect to the temporal resolution. However, in order to eventually control microbial community dynamics, monitoring schemes of high temporal resolution are required. Flow cytometry provides single-cell-based data in the required temporal resolution, and we here use such data to compute stability properties as easy to interpret univariate indicators of microbial community dynamics. Such monitoring tools will allow for a fast, continuous, and cost-effective screening of stability states of microbiomes. Applicable to various environments, including bioreactors, surface water, and the human body, it will contribute to the development of control schemes to manipulate microbial community structures and performances.

AB Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma characterized by dense fibrous stroma, resistance to chemotherapy and a lack of actionable driver mutations, and is highly associated with ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage. We analysed sixty patients with advanced desmoplastic melanoma who had been treated with antibodies to block programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1). Objective tumour responses were observed in forty-two of the sixty patients (70%; 95% confidence interval 57-81%), including nineteen patients (32%) with a complete response. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a high mutational load and frequent NF1 mutations (fourteen out of seventeen cases) in these tumours. Immunohistochemistry analysis from nineteen desmoplastic melanomas and thirteen non-desmoplastic melanomas revealed a higher percentage of PD-L1-positive cells in the tumour parenchyma in desmoplastic melanomas (P=0.04); these cells were highly associated with increased CD8 density and PD-L1 expression in the tumour invasive margin. Therefore, patients with advanced desmoplastic melanoma derive substantial clinical benefit from PD-1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy, even though desmoplastic melanoma is defined by its dense desmoplastic fibrous stroma. The benefit is likely to result from the high mutational burden and a frequent pre-existing adaptive immune response limited by PD-L1 expression.

AB Next-generation deep sequencing of gene panels is being adopted as a diagnostic test to identify actionable mutations in cancer patient samples. However, clinical samples, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, frequently provide low quantities of degraded, poor quality DNA. To overcome these issues, many sequencing assays rely on extensive PCR amplification leading to an accumulation of bias and artifacts. Thus, there is a need for a targeted sequencing assay that performs well with DNA of low quality and quantity without relying on extensive PCR amplification. We evaluate the performance of a targeted sequencing assay based on Oligonucleotide Selective Sequencing, which permits the enrichment of genes and regions of interest and the identification of sequence variants from low amounts of damaged DNA. This assay utilizes a repair process adapted to clinical FFPE samples, followed by adaptor ligation to single stranded DNA and a primer-based capture technique. Our approach generates sequence libraries of high fidelity with reduced reliance on extensive PCR amplification-this facilitates the accurate assessment of copy number alterations in addition to delivering accurate single nucleotide variant and insertion/deletion detection. We apply this method to capture and sequence the exons of a panel of 130 cancer-related genes, from which we obtain high read coverage uniformity across the targeted regions at starting input DNA amounts as low as 10ng per sample. We demonstrate the performance using a series of reference DNA samples, and by identifying sequence variants in DNA from matched clinical samples originating from different tissue types.

AB Background: The utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the diagnosis and management of adult-onset constitutional disorders has not been adequately studied. Genetic diagnostics may be advantageous in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in whom the cause of kidney failure often remains unknown.; Objective: To study the diagnostic utility of WES in a selected referral population of adults with CKD.; Design: Observational cohort.; Setting: A major academic medical center.; Patients: 92 adults with CKD of unknown cause or familial nephropathy or hypertension.; Measurements: The diagnostic yield of WES and its potential effect on clinical management.; Results: Whole-exome sequencing provided a diagnosis in 22 of 92 patients (24%), including 9 probands with CKD of unknown cause and encompassing 13 distinct genetic disorders. Among these, loss-of-function mutations were identified in PARN in 2 probands with tubulointerstitial fibrosis. PARN mutations have been implicated in a short telomere syndrome characterized by lung, bone marrow, and liver fibrosis; these findings extend the phenotype of PARN mutations to renal fibrosis. In addition, review of the American College of Medical Genetics actionable genes identified a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation in a proband who was diagnosed with breast cancer on follow-up. The results affected clinical management in most identified cases, including initiation of targeted surveillance, familial screening to guide donor selection for transplantation, and changes in therapy.; Limitation: The small sample size and recruitment at a tertiary care academic center limit generalizability of findings among the broader CKD population.; Conclusion: Whole-exome sequencing identified diagnostic mutations in a substantial number of adults with CKD of many causes. Further study of the utility of WES in the evaluation and care of patients with CKD in additional settings is warranted.; Primary Funding Source: New York State Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program, Renal Research Institute, and National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

AB Mounting evidence suggests that weight management and physical activity (PA) improve overall health and well being, and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors. Although many opportunities exist to include weight management and PA in routine cancer care, several barriers remain. This review summarizes key topics addressed in a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine workshop entitled, "Incorporating Weight Management and Physical Activity Throughout the Cancer Care Continuum." Discussions related to body weight and PA among cancer survivors included: 1) current knowledge and gaps related to health outcomes; 2) effective intervention approaches; 3) addressing the needs of diverse populations of cancer survivors; 4) opportunities and challenges of workforce, care coordination, and technologies for program implementation; 5) models of care; and 6) program coverage. While more discoveries are still needed for the provision of optimal weight-management and PA programs for cancer survivors, obesity and inactivity currently jeopardize their overall health and quality of life. Actionable future directions are presented for research; practice and policy changes required to assure the availability of effective, affordable, and feasible weight management; and PA services for all cancer survivors as a part of their routine cancer care.

AB BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated (WD) and poorly differentiated (PD) pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are biologically distinct entities with different therapies and prognoses. WD neoplasms with elevated proliferation (Ki-67>20%) have been shown to have an overlapping histology with PD neuroendocrine carcinomas. This study compared expert cytomorphologic assessments of differentiation in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms in a multi-institutional study.; METHODS: Fine-needle aspiration specimens from pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (grade 2 [G2] and grade 3 [G3] according to the 2017 World Health Organization classification; n=72) were diagnosed independently by 3 cytopathologists as WD or PD (poorly differentiated large cell type [PD-L] or poorly differentiated small cell type [PD-S]) purely on the basis of cytomorphology. Their diagnoses were compared with a final classification supported by immunohistochemistry (retinoblastoma (RB), death domain- associated protein (DAXX), and alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) protein expression), targeted mutation analysis (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), prior history of G1/G2 histology, and consensus.; RESULTS: The rate of agreement on differentiation was 38% (15 WD cases and 12 PD cases) for the 70 cases included (55 WD cases [n=19 G2, n=31 G3, and n=5 could not be graded] and 15 PD cases [n=6 PD-S, n=6 PD-L, and n=3 PD, not otherwise specified). Two cases could not be classified by the employed methods. PD carcinomas had a higher rate of agreement (10 of 15 [67%]) than WD neoplasms (15 of 55 [27%]). Round nuclei and plasmacytoid cells were associated with agreement for WD cases, whereas apoptosis and angulated nuclei were associated with disagreement. Necrosis was associated with agreement for PD cases.; CONCLUSIONS: A purely morphologic approach to the distinction between G2 and G3 pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms based on cytology can be challenging, with disagreement found among experienced cytopathologists.

AB Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus (PMME) is a rare and aggressive disease with high tendency of metastasis. To characterize the genetic basis and intratumor heterogeneity of PMME, we performed multiregion exome sequencing and whole genome SNP array genotyping of 12 samples obtained from a patient with PMME. High intratumor heterogeneity was observed in both somatic mutation and copy-number alteration levels. Nine geographically separate samples including two normal samples were clonally related and followed a branched evolution model. Most putative oncogenic drivers such as BRAF and KRAS mutations as well as CDKN2A biallelic inactivation were observed in trunk clones, whereas clinically actionable mutations such as PIK3CA and JAK1 mutations were detected in branch clones. Ancestor tumor clones evolved into three subclonal clades: clade1 fostered metastatic subclones that carried metastatic features of PIK3CA and ARHGAP26 point mutations as well as chr13 arm-level deletion, clade2 owned branch-specific JAK1 mutations and PTEN deletion, and clade3 was found in two vertical distribution samples below the primary tumor area, highlighting the fact that it is possible for PMME to disseminate by the submucosal longitudinal lymphatic route at an early stage of metastasis. These findings facilitate interpretation of the genetic essence of this rare melanoma subtype as well as the pattern of cancer evolution, thus reinforcing the therapeutic challenges associated with PMME.Significance: This study highlights the use of multiregion exome sequencing and whole genome SNP array genotyping to comprehensively characterize the genetic landscape of a rare type of esophogeal melanoma.

AB Purpose: Glioblastoma is an aggressive and molecularly heterogeneous cancer with few effective treatment options. We hypothesized that next-generation sequencing can be used to guide treatment recommendations within a clinically acceptable time frame following surgery for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.Experimental Design: We conducted a prospective genomics-informed feasibility trial in adults with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma. Following surgical resection, genome-wide tumor/normal exome sequencing and tumor RNA sequencing were performed to identify molecular targets for potential matched therapy. A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board issued treatment recommendations based on the genomic results, blood-brain barrier penetration of the indicated therapies, drug-drug interactions, and drug safety profiles. Feasibility of generating genomics-informed treatment recommendations within 35 days of surgery was assessed.Results: Of the 20 patients enrolled in the study, 16 patients had sufficient tumor tissue for analysis. Exome sequencing was completed for all patients, and RNA sequencing was completed for 14 patients. Treatment recommendations were provided within the study's feasibility time frame for 15 of 16 (94%) patients. Seven patients received treatment based on the tumor board recommendations. Two patients reached 12-month progression-free survival, both adhering to treatments based on the molecular profiling results. One patient remained on treatment and progression free 21 months after surgery, 3 times longer than the patient's previous time to progression. Analysis of matched nonenhancing tissue from 12 patients revealed overlapping as well as novel putatively actionable genomic alterations.Conclusions: Use of genome-wide molecular profiling is feasible and can be informative for guiding real-time, central nervous system-penetrant, genomics-informed treatment recommendations for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

AB Increasing amounts of biological data are accumulating in the pharmaceutical industry and academic institutions. However, data does not equal actionable information, and guidelines for appropriate data capture, harmonization, integration, mining, and visualization need to be established to fully harness its potential. Here, we describe ongoing efforts at Merck & Co. to structure data in the area of chemogenomics. We are integrating complementary data from both internal and external data sources into one chemogenomics database (Chemical Genetic Interaction Enterprise; CHEMGENIE). Here, we demonstrate how this well-curated database facilitates compound set design, tool compound selection, target deconvolution in phenotypic screening, and predictive model building.

AB INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer subtypes are currently defined by a combination of morphologic, genomic, and proteomic characteristics. These subtypes provide a molecular portrait of the tumor that aids diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment escalation/de-escalation options. Gene expression signatures describing intrinsic breast cancer subtypes for predicting risk of recurrence have been rapidly adopted in the clinic. Despite the use of subtype classifications, many patients develop drug resistance, breast cancer recurrence, or therapy failure. Areas covered: This review provides a summary of immunohistochemistry, reverse phase protein array, mass spectrometry, and integrative studies that are revealing differences in biological functions within and between breast cancer subtypes. We conclude with a discussion of rigor and reproducibility for proteomic-based biomarker discovery. Expert commentary: Innovations in proteomics, including implementation of assay guidelines and standards, are facilitating refinement of breast cancer subtypes. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic information distinguish biologically functional subtypes, are predictive of recurrence, and indicate likelihood of drug resistance. Actionable, activated signal transduction pathways can now be quantified and characterized. Proteomic biomarker validation in large, well-designed studies should become a public health priority to capitalize on the wealth of information gleaned from the proteome.

AB INTRODUCTION: Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) offer numerous benefits in health care but also pose certain risks. As we progress toward the implementation of EHRs, a more in-depth understanding of attitudes that influence overall levels of EHR support is required.; OBJECTIVES: To record public and physicians' awareness, expectations for, and ethical concerns about the use of EHRs.; METHODS: A convenience sample was surveyed for both the public and physicians. The Public's Questionnaire was distributed to the public in a printed and an online version. The Physicians' Questionnaire was distributed to physicians in an online version. The questionnaires requested demographic characteristics followed by close-ended questions enquiring about awareness, perceived impact, perceived risks, and ethical issues raised by EHR use.; RESULTS: In total, 46% of the public and 91% of physicians were aware of EHRs. Physicians' and public opinions were comparable concerning the positive impact of EHRs on better, more effective, and faster decisions on the patients' health, on better coordination between hospitals/clinics and on quality and reduced cost of health care. However, physicians were concerned that an EHR system would be a burden for their finances, for their time concerning training on the system, for their everyday workload and workflow. The majority of the public generally agreed that they would worry about the possibility that a non-authorized, third party might gain access to their personal health information (48.8%), and that they would worry about future discriminations due to possible disclosure of their health information (48.8%). Most physicians disagreed that EHRs will disrupt the doctor-patient relationship (58.1%) but they would worry about the safety of their patients' information (53.1%). Overall, both the public and physicians were in favor of the implementation of an EHR system, evaluating that possible benefits are more important than possible risks. The majority of the public believed that physicians should have full access to an EHR (90.9%), whereas nursing staff, pharmacists, laboratory staff, and other healthcare professional should have partial access.; CONCLUSIONS: The factors identified in the present study present actionable insights that may increase awareness about EHRs. The survey illustrates that both the public and physicians acknowledge the benefits and support EHRs on the condition that sufficient guarantees are provided about privacy and security.

AB INTRODUCTION: Electronic audit and feedback (e-A&F) systems are used worldwide for care quality improvement. They measure health professionals' performance against clinical guidelines, and some systems suggest improvement actions. However, little is known about optimal interface designs for e-A&F, in particular how to present suggested actions for improvement. We developed a novel theory-informed system for primary care (the Performance Improvement plaN GeneratoR; PINGR) that covers the four principal interface components: clinical performance summaries; patient lists; detailed patient-level information; and suggested actions. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of an e-A&F system with all four interface components.; OBJECTIVES: (1) Use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the usability of PINGR with target end-users; (2) refine existing design recommendations for e-A&F systems; (3) determine the implications of these recommendations for patient safety.; METHODS: We recruited seven primary care physicians to perform seven tasks with PINGR, during which we measured on-screen behaviour and eye movements. Participants subsequently completed usability questionnaires, and were interviewed in-depth. Data were integrated to: gain a more complete understanding of usability issues; enhance and explain each other's findings; and triangulate results to increase validity.; RESULTS: Participants committed a median of 10 errors (range 8-21) when using PINGR's interface, and completed a median of five out of seven tasks (range 4-7). Errors violated six usability heuristics: clear response options; perceptual grouping and data relationships; representational formats; unambiguous description; visually distinct screens for confusable items; and workflow integration. Eye movement analysis revealed the integration of components largely supported effective user workflow, although the modular design of clinical performance summaries unnecessarily increased cognitive load. Interviews and questionnaires revealed PINGR is user-friendly, and that improved information prioritisation could further promote useful user action.; CONCLUSIONS: Comparing our results with the wider usability literature we refine a previously published set of interface design recommendations for e-A&F. The implications for patient safety are significant regarding: user engagement; actionability; and information prioritisation. Our results also support adopting multi-method approaches in usability studies to maximise issue discovery and the credibility of findings. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is an aggressive mesenchymal malignancy with few therapeutic options. The mechanisms underlying LMS development, including clinically actionable genetic vulnerabilities, are largely unknown. Here we show, using whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, that LMS tumors are characterized by substantial mutational heterogeneity, near-universal inactivation of TP53 and RB1, widespread DNA copy number alterations including chromothripsis, and frequent whole-genome duplication. Furthermore, we detect alternative telomere lengthening in 78% of cases and identify recurrent alterations in telomere maintenance genes such as ATRX, RBL2, and SP100, providing insight into the genetic basis of this mechanism. Finally, most tumors display hallmarks of "BRCAness", including alterations in homologous recombination DNA repair genes, multiple structural rearrangements, and enrichment of specific mutational signatures, and cultured LMS cells are sensitive towards olaparib and cisplatin.

AB Tumor complexity and intratumor heterogeneity contribute to subclonal diversity. Despite advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics, detecting rare mutations in primary tumors and metastases contributing to subclonal diversity is a challenge for precision genomics. Here, in order to identify rare mutations, we adapted a recently described epithelial reprograming assay for short-term propagation of epithelial cells from primary and metastatic tumors. Using this approach, we expanded minor clones and obtained epithelial cell-specific DNA/RNA for quantitative NGS analysis. Comparative Ampliseq Comprehensive Cancer Panel sequence analyses were performed on DNA from unprocessed breast tumor and tumor cells propagated from the same tumor. We identified previously uncharacterized mutations present only in the cultured tumor cells, a subset of which has been reported in brain metastatic but not primary breast tumors. In addition, whole-genome sequencing identified mutations enriched in liver metastases of various cancers, including Notch pathway mutations/chromosomal inversions in 5/5 liver metastases, irrespective of cancer types. Mutations/rearrangements in FHIT, involved in purine metabolism, were detected in 4/5 liver metastases, and the same four liver metastases shared mutations in 32 genes, including mutations of different HLA-DR family members affecting OX40 signaling pathway, which could impact the immune response to metastatic cells. Pathway analyses of all mutated genes in liver metastases showed aberrant tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor signaling in metastatic cells. Epigenetic regulators including KMT2C/MLL3 and ARID1B, which are mutated in >50% of hepatocellular carcinomas, were also mutated in liver metastases. Thus, irrespective of cancer types, organ-specific metastases may share common genomic aberrations. Since recent studies show independent evolution of primary tumors and metastases and in most cases mutation burden is higher in metastases than primary tumors, the method described here may allow early detection of subclonal somatic alterations associated with metastatic progression and potentially identify therapeutically actionable, metastasis-specific genomic aberrations.

AB BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with different gastrointestinal cancers varies widely. Despite advances in treatment strategies, such as extensive resections and the addition of new drugs to chemotherapy regimens, conventional treatment strategies have failed to improve survival for many tumours. Although promising, the clinical application of molecularly guided personalized treatment has proven to be challenging. This narrative review focuses on the personalization of cancer therapy using patient-derived three-dimensional 'organoid' models.; METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant articles. An overview of the literature and published protocols is presented, and the implications of these models for patients with cancer, surgeons and oncologists are explained.; RESULTS: Organoid culture methods have been established for healthy and diseased tissues from oesophagus, stomach, intestine, pancreas, bile duct and liver. Because organoids can be generated with high efficiency and speed from fine-needle aspirations, biopsies or resection specimens, they can serve as a personal cancer model. Personalized treatment could become a more standard practice by using these cell cultures for extensive molecular diagnosis and drug screening. Drug sensitivity assays can give a clinically actionable sensitivity profile of a patient's tumour. However, the predictive capability of organoid drug screening has not been evaluated in prospective clinical trials.; CONCLUSION: High-throughput drug screening on organoids, combined with next-generation sequencing, proteomic analysis and other state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic methods, can shape cancer treatment to become more effective with fewer side-effects. © 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: Tympanostomy tube (TT) placement is common in children; however, family-centeredness and utility of online information used for decision making and understanding is unknown. We evaluate the quality of leading Internet resources describing TT placement.; STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive design.; METHODS: We performed a Google (Menlo Park, CA) search for terms related to TTs. We defined quality using scaled readability measures (Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade-Level), understandability and actionability (Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool), shared decision-making centrality (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services informed consent guidelines), and clinical practice guideline (CPG) compatibility. Three reviewers coded each measure. Fleiss kappa interrater reliability analysis was performed.; RESULTS: Ten most frequently encountered websites were analyzed. One of 10 met national health literacy standards (mean 10th-grade level reading, median 9th, range 6-15th). All sites were understandable (mean understandability 81.9%, range 73%-92%). Most had low actionability scores (7 of 10, median 47%, mean 44.6%, range 0-80). Shared decision-making centrality was high (mean 5, range 4-6), but most did not list alternative treatment options. Although CPG compatibility was high (mean 3.4, range 1-4), many websites contained inconsistent recommendations about tube duration, follow-up, and water precautions. There was inter-rater agreement for understandability scoring (kappa = 0.20; P = 0.02).; CONCLUSION: Internet resources about TT placement vary in quality pertaining to health literacy, principles of shared decision making, and consistency with practice guidelines. With growing emphasis on patient-/family-centered engagement in healthcare decision making, standardization of content and improved usability of educational materials for common surgical procedures in children such as tympanostomy tube placement should be a public health priority.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.

AB Existing literature on implicit bias is fragmented and comes from a variety of fields like cognitive psychology, business ethics, and higher education, but implicit-bias-informed educational approaches have been underexplored in health professions education and are difficult to evaluate using existing tools. Despite increasing attention to implicit bias recognition and management in health professions education, many programs struggle to meaningfully integrate these topics into curricula. The authors propose a six-point actionable framework for integrating implicit bias recognition and management into health professions education that draws on the work of previous researchers and includes practical tools to guide curriculum developers. The six key features of this framework are creating a safe and nonthreatening learning context, increasing knowledge about the science of implicit bias, emphasizing how implicit bias influences behaviors and patient outcomes, increasing self-awareness of existing implicit biases, improving conscious efforts to overcome implicit bias, and enhancing awareness of how implicit bias influences others. Important considerations for designing implicit-bias-informed curricula-such as individual and contextual variables, as well as formal and informal cultural influences-are discussed. The authors also outline assessment and evaluation approaches that consider outcomes at individual, organizational, community, and societal levels. The proposed framework may facilitate future research and exploration regarding the use of implicit bias in health professions education.

AB BACKGROUND: Breast surgeons have a wide variety of intraoperative techniques available to help achieve low rates for positive margins of excision, with variable levels of evidence.; METHODS: A systematic review of the medical literature from 1995 to July 2016 was conducted, with 434 abstracts identified and evaluated. The analysis included 106 papers focused on intraoperative management of breast cancer margins and contained actionable data.; RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided lumpectomy for palpable tumors, as an alternative to palpation guidance, can lower positive margin rates, but the effect when used as an alternative to wire localization (WL) for nonpalpable tumors is less certain. Localization techniques such as radioactive seed localization and radioguided occult lesion localization were found potentially to lower positive margin rates as alternatives to WL depending on baseline positive margin rates. Intraoperative pathologic methods including gross histology, frozen section analysis, and imprint cytology all have the potential to lower the rates of positive margins. Cavity-shave margins and the Marginprobe device both lower rates of positive margins, with some potential for negative cosmetic effects. Specimen radiography and multiple miscellaneous techniques did not affect positive margin rates or provided too little evidence for formation of a conclusion.; CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of the literature showed evidence that several intraoperative techniques and actions can lower the rates of positive margins. These results are presented together with graded recommendations.

AB F-box proteins participate in multiple cellular processes through ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of target proteins, such as cyclin D1 as target of FBXW8. To investigate the spectrum of FBXW8 germ-line mutations in patients with breast cancer and healthy controls, we analyzed the whole FBXW8 coding region and flanking untranslated portions in germ-line DNA samples of 91 breast cancer patients and 277 healthy controls using next-generation amplicon sequencing. Five missense variants, one splice site variant, one frameshift variant, one synonymous variant, and one variant in the 3'-UTR were identified. Frameshift mutation FBXW8 c.1312_1313delGT was considered functionally relevant and was investigated for its potential association with breast cancer risk through subsequent genotyping in two hospital-based breast cancer case-control series from Belarus and Germany, respectively, comprising a total of 2740 breast cancer cases and 2174 controls. The mutation was found in 30 cases and 23 controls with an adjusted Odds Ratio 1.02 (95% CI 0.59-1.77; p=0.94) in the combined analysis. There was no statistically significant difference when patients were stratified by ER status, PR status, age at diagnosis, ductal histology, contralateral status, family history or tumor grade. Altogether, our data exclude clinically actionable breast cancer risks above two-fold for the FBXW8 c.1312_1313delGT mutation, although larger studies would be needed to exclude low-penetrance associations.

AB Whole exome sequencing (WES) has the potential of identifying secondary findings that are predictive of poor pharmacotherapy outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate patients' wishes regarding the reporting of secondary pharmacogenomic findings. WES results (n = 106 patients) were retrospectively reviewed to determine the number of patients electing to receive secondary pharmacogenomic results. Phenotypes were assigned based on Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines. The percent of patients with a predicted phenotype associated with a gene-based CPIC dosing recommendation was determined. Ninety-nine patients (93.4%) elected to receive secondary pharmacogenomic findings. For each gene-drug pair analyzed, the number of patients with an actionable phenotype ranged from two (2%) to 43 patients (43.4%). Combining all gene-drug pairs, 84 unique patients (84.8%) had an actionable phenotype. A prospective multidisciplinary practice model was developed for integrating secondary pharmacogenomic findings into clinical practice. Our model highlights a unique collaboration between physician-geneticists, pharmacists, and genetic counselors. © 2017 The Authors.

AB INTRODUCTION: A substantial fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harbor targetable genetic alterations. In this study, we analyzed the feasibility and clinical utility of integrating a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel into our routine lung cancer molecular subtyping algorithm.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: After routine pathologic and molecular subtyping, we implemented an amplicon-based gene panel for DNA analysis covering mutational hot spots in 22 cancer genes in consecutive advanced-stage NSCLCs.; RESULTS: We analyzed 109 tumors using NGS between December 2014 and January 2016. Fifty-six patients (51%) were treatment-naive and 82 (75%) had lung adenocarcinomas. In 89 cases (82%), we used samples derived from lung cancer diagnostic procedures. We obtained successful sequencing results in 95 cases (87%). As part of our routine lung cancer molecular subtyping protocol, single-gene testing for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 was attempted in nonsquamous and 3 squamous-cell cancers (n= 92). Sixty-nine of 92 samples (75%) had sufficient tissue to complete ALK and ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and NGS. With the integration of the gene panel, 40 NSCLCs (37%) in the entire cohort and 30 NSCLCs (40%) fully tested for ALK and ROS1 IHC and NGS had actionable mutations. KRAS (24%) and EGFR (10%) were the most frequently mutated actionable genes. Ten patients (9%) received matched targeted therapies, 6 (5%) in clinical trials.; CONCLUSION: The combination of IHC tests for ALK and ROS1 and amplicon-based NGS is applicable in routine clinical practice, enabling patient selection for genotype-tailored treatments.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review describes recent advances and unique challenges in precision medicine for pediatric cancers and highlights clinical trials assessing the clinical impact of targeted therapy matched to molecular alterations identified by tumor profiling.; RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple prospective clinical sequencing studies in pediatric oncology have been reported in the last 2 years. These studies demonstrated feasibility of sequencing in the clinic and revealed a rate of actionable variants that justifies the development of precision trials for childhood cancer. A number of precision medicine trials are recently completed, underway or in development and these will be reviewed herein, with a focus on highlighting aspects of precision medicine trial design relevant to pediatric oncology.; SUMMARY: The primary results of the first round of pediatric precision oncology clinical trials will provide us with a greater understanding of the clinical impact of linking tumor profiling to selection of targeted therapies. The aggregation of sequencing and clinical data from these trials and the results of biologic investigations linked to these trials will drive further discoveries and broaden opportunities for precision medicine for children with cancer.

AB The aim of our study was to review the clinicopathologic features and management of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). Relevant manuscripts published in English were searched using PubMed. aCML is diagnosed as per WHO 2016 classification in the presence of leukocytosis≥13*109/l with circulating neutrophil precursors≥10%, monocytes less than 10%, minimal basophils, hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic proliferation and dysplasia, bone marrow blast less than20% and absence of BCR/ABL fusion gene. Common cytogenetic features and mutations include trisomy 8, and mutations in SETBP1 and ETNK1. Median survival is 1-2years. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be the only curative option. Ruxolitinib and dasatinib are emerging therapeutic options. Thus,aCML is a rare entity with poor survival. Novel therapies are needed.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are determined by cancer-related and non-related events. Treatments for hepatitis C virus infection have reduced non-cancer events among patients receiving liver transplants, so reducing HCC-related death might be an actionable end point. We performed a competing-risk analysis to evaluate factors associated with survival of patients with HCC and developed a prognostic model based on features of HCC patients before liver transplantation.; METHODS: We performed multivariable competing-risk regression analysis to identify factors associated with HCC-specific death of patients who underwent liver transplantation. The training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China. We collected pretransplantation data on etiology of liver disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates, and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC recurrence after transplantation, disseminated extra- and/or intrahepatic tumor relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread. The cumulative incidence of death was segregated for hepatitis C virus status.; RESULTS: In the competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log10 level of AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P < .001), returning an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.798). Five-year cumulative incidence of non-HCC-related death was 8.6% in HCV-negative patients and 18.1% in HCV-positive patients. For patients with HCC to have a 70% chance of HCC-specific survival 5 years after transplantation, their level of AFP should be <200 ng/mL and the sum of number and size of tumors (in centimeters) should not exceed 7; if the level of AFP was 200-400 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should be ≤5; if their level of AFP was 400-1000 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should be ≤4. In the validation set, the model identified patients who survived 5 years after liver transplantation with 0.721 accuracy (95% confidence interval, 0.648%-0.793%). Our model, based on patients' level of AFP and HCC number and size, outperformed the Milan; University of California, San Francisco; Shanghai-Fudan; Up-to-7 criteria (P < .001); and AFP French model (P= .044) to predict which patients will survive for 5 years after liver transplantation.; CONCLUSIONS: We developed a model based on level of AFP, tumor size, and tumor number, to determine risk of death from HCC-related factors after liver transplantation. This model might be used to select end points and refine selection criteria for liver transplantation for patients with HCC.

AB PurposeWe integrated whole-exome sequencing (WES) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) into a clinical workflow to serve an endogamous, uninsured, agrarian community.MethodsSeventy-nine probands (newborn to 49.8 years) who presented between 1998 and 2015 remained undiagnosed after biochemical and molecular investigations. We generated WES data for probands and family members and vetted variants through rephenotyping, segregation analyses, and population studies.ResultsThe most common presentation was neurological disease (64%). Seven (9%) probands were diagnosed by CMA. Family WES data were informative for 37 (51%) of the 72 remaining individuals, yielding a specific genetic diagnosis (n=32) or revealing a novel molecular etiology (n=5). For five (7%) additional subjects, negative WES decreased the likelihood of genetic disease. Compared to trio analysis, "family" WES (average seven exomes per proband) reduced filtered candidate variants from 22±6 to 5±3 per proband. Nineteen (51%) alleles were de novo and 17 (46%) inherited; the latter added to a population-based diagnostic panel. We found actionable secondary variants in 21 (4.2%) of 502 subjects, all of whom opted to be informed.ConclusionCMA and family-based WES streamline and economize diagnosis of rare genetic disorders, accelerate novel gene discovery, and create new opportunities for community-based screening and prevention in underserved populations.

AB OBJECTIVE: Microscopic residual disease following complete cytoreduction (R0) is associated with a significant survival benefit for patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Our objective was to develop a prediction model for R0 to support surgeons in their clinical care decisions.; METHODS: Demographic, pathologic, surgical, and CA125 data were collected from GOG 182 records. Patients enrolled prior to September 1, 2003 were used for the training model while those enrolled after constituted the validation data set. Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of R0 and these variables were subsequently analyzed using multivariable regression. The regression model was reduced using backward selection and predictive accuracy was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) in both the training and the validation data sets.; RESULTS: Of the 3882 patients enrolled in GOG 182, 1480 had complete clinical data available for the analysis. The training data set consisted of 1007 patients (234 with R0) while the validation set was comprised of 473 patients (122 with R0). The reduced multivariable regression model demonstrated several variables predictive of R0 at cytoreduction: Disease Score (DS) (p<0.001), stage (p=0.009), CA125 (p<0.001), ascites (p<0.001), and stage-age interaction (p=0.01). Applying the prediction model to the validation data resulted in an AUC of 0.73 (0.67 to 0.78, 95% CI). Inclusion of DS enhanced the model performance to an AUC of 0.83 (0.79 to 0.88, 95% CI).; CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a prediction model for R0 that offers improved performance over previously reported models for prediction of residual disease. The performance of the prediction model suggests additional factors (i.e. imaging, molecular profiling, etc.) should be explored in the future for a more clinically actionable tool.

AB A large percentage of patients with cancer will develop brain metastases, and many of them will die within a few months following diagnosis of intracranial metastasis. Although the majority of the central nervous system metastases are derived from a well-known primary neoplasm, about 5-10% of brain metastases are from an unknown source, making the tissue diagnosis a first step in the search for a primary malignancy. The pathologist utilizes several immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic tools for such investigation, helping the clinical oncologist to narrow down the clinical and radiologic exploration. Recently, analysis of actionable biomarkers for target therapy in brain metastasis has become significant due to reports of discrepancy of potential biomarkers between primary tumors and metastatic brain deposits.

AB BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease comprising not only different histological subtypes but also different molecular subtypes.; AIM: To describe the frequency of oncogenic drivers in patients with metastatic NSCLC, the proportion of patients tested and survival difference according to mutation status in a single-institution study.; METHODS: Metastatic NSCLC patients enrolled in a prospective Thoracic Malignancies Cohort Study between July 2012 and August 2016 were selected. Patients underwent molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements, Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS), B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) mutations and ROS1 gene rearrangements. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method for groups of interest, and comparisons were made using the log-rank test.; RESULTS: A total of 392 patients were included, 43% of whom were female with median age of 64years (28-92). Of 296 patients tested, 172 patients (58%) were positive for an oncogenic driver: 81 patients (27%) were EGFR positive, 25 patients (9%) were ALK positive, 57 patients (19%) had KRAS mutation and 9 patients (3%) were ROS1 or BRAF positive. Patients with an actionable mutation (EGFR/ALK) had a survival advantage when compared with patients who were mutation negative (hazard ratio (HR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.71; P<0.01). Survival difference between mutation negative and mutation status unknown was not statistically significant when adjusted for confounding factors in a multivariate analysis (HR 1.29; 95% CI 0.97-1.78, P=0.08).; CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort, the presence of an actionable mutation was the strongest predictor of overall survival. These results confirm the importance of molecular testing and suggest likely survival benefit of identification and treatment of actionable oncogenes. © 2017 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with type 1 diabetes routinely utilize a single premeal fingerstick glucose to determine premeal insulin doses. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides much richer glycemic trend information, including glycemic slope (GS). How to incorporate this information into dosing decisions remains an open question.; METHODS: We examined the relationship between premeal GS and postmeal glycemic excursions in 240 individuals with type 1 diabetes receiving CGM augmented insulin pump therapy. Over 23.5 million CGM values were synchronized with 264 500 meals. CGM values were integrated 2 hours premeal to compute GS and 2 hours postmeal to compute glycemic excursion outcomes. Postmeal hyperglycemia (integrated CGM glucose >180 mg/dL*hr) and postmeal hypoglycemic events (any CGM glucose < 70 mg/dL) were tabulated according to positive/negative premeal GS and according to GS bins commonly displayed as rate-of-change arrows on CGM devices.; RESULTS: Positive versus negative premeal GS was associated with a 2.28-fold (95% CI 2.25-2.32) risk of postmeal hyperglycemia. Negative versus positive premeal GS was associated with a 2.36-fold (95% CI 2.25-2.43) increase in one or more postprandial hypoglycemic events. Premeal GS in the bin currently displayed as "no change" on existing CGM devices (-1 to 1 mg/dL/min), conferred a 1.82-fold (95% CI 1.79-1.86) risk of postprandial hyperglycemia when positive and a 2.06-fold (95% CI 1.99-2.15) increased risk of postprandial hypoglycemia when negative.; CONCLUSION: Premeal GS predicts postmeal glycemic excursions and may help inform insulin dosing decisions. Rate-of-change arrows on existing devices obscure clinically actionable glycemic trend information from CGM users.

AB We aimed to assess the utility of a novel, noninvasive method of detecting genomic alterations in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, i.e., the use of liquid biopsies to obtain blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through an analysis of the genomic landscape of ctDNA (68 genes) from 213 patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers. The most common cancer types were colorectal adenocarcinoma (N = 55; 26%), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (N = 46; 22%), hepatocellular carcinoma (N = 31; 15%), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (N = 25; 12%). The majority of patients (58%) had ≥1 characterized alteration (excluded variants of unknown significance). The median number of characterized alterations was 1 (range, 0-13). The number of detected alterations per patient varied between different cancer types: in hepatocellular carcinoma, 74% of patients (23/31) had ≥1 characterized alteration(s) versus 24% of appendiceal adenocarcinoma patients (11/46). The median percent ctDNA among characterized alterations was 2.50% (interquartile range, 0.76%-8.96%). Overall, 95% of patients (117/123) had distinct molecular portfolios with 143 unique characterized alterations within 56 genes. Overall, concordance rates of 96%, 94%, 95%, and 91%, respectively, were found between ctDNA and tissue biopsy (N = 105 patients) in the four most common alterations (KRAS amplification, MYC amplification, KRAS G12V, and EGFR amplification). Of 123 patients with characterized alterations, >99% (122/123; 57% of entire population tested; 122/213) had one or more alterations potentially actionable by experimental or approved drugs. These observations suggest that many patients with gastrointestinal tumors, including difficult-to-biopsy malignancies like hepatocellular cancers, frequently have discernible and theoretically pharmacologically tractable ctDNA alterations that merit further studies in prospective trials.

AB There is an emerging consensus that genomic researchers should, at a minimum, offer to return to individual participants clinically valid, medically important and medically actionable genomic findings (for example, pathogenic variants in BRCA1) identified in the course of research. However, this is not a common practice in psychiatric genetics research. Furthermore, psychiatry researchers often generate findings that do not meet all of these criteria, yet there may be ethically compelling arguments to offer selected results. Here, we review the return of results debate in genomics research and propose that, as for genomic studies of other medical conditions, psychiatric genomics researchers should offer findings that meet the minimum criteria stated above. Additionally, if resources allow, psychiatry researchers could consider offering to return pre-specified 'clinically valuable' findings even if not medically actionable-for instance, findings that help corroborate a psychiatric diagnosis, and findings that indicate important health risks. Similarly, we propose offering 'likely clinically valuable' findings, specifically, variants of uncertain significance potentially related to a participant's symptoms. The goal of this Perspective is to initiate a discussion that can help identify optimal ways of managing the return of results from psychiatric genomics research.

AB The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) is the largest consortium in the history of psychiatry. This global effort is dedicated to rapid progress and open science, and in the past decade it has delivered an increasing flow of new knowledge about the fundamental basis of common psychiatric disorders. The PGC has recently commenced a program of research designed to deliver "actionable" findings-genomic results that 1) reveal fundamental biology, 2) inform clinical practice, and 3) deliver new therapeutic targets. The central idea of the PGC is to convert the family history risk factor into biologically, clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights. The emerging findings suggest that we are entering a phase of accelerated genetic discovery for multiple psychiatric disorders. These findings are likely to elucidate the genetic portions of these truly complex traits, and this knowledge can then be mined for its relevance for improved therapeutics and its impact on psychiatric practice within a precision medicine framework. [AJP at 175: Remembering Our Past As We Envision Our Future November 1946: The Genetic Theory of Schizophrenia Franz Kallmann's influential twin study of schizophrenia in 691 twin pairs was the largest in the field for nearly four decades.

AB Inter-ethnic differences in drug response are all too well known. These are underpinned by a number of factors, including pharmacogenetic differences across various ethnic populations. Precision medicine relies on genotype-based prescribing decisions with the aim of maximizing efficacy and mitigating the risks. When there is no access to genotyping tests, ethnicity is frequently regarded as a proxy of the patient's probable genotype on the basis of overall population-based frequency of genetic variations in the ethnic group the patient belongs to, with some variations being ethnicity-specific. However, ever-increasing transcontinental migration of populations and the resulting admixing of populations have undermined the utility of self-identified ethnicity in predicting the genetic ancestry, and therefore the genotype, of the patient. An example of the relevance of genetic ancestry of a patient is the inadequate performance of European-derived pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms of warfarin in African Americans, Brazilians and Caribbean Hispanics. Consequently, genotyping a patient potentially requires testing for all known clinically actionable variants that the patient may harbour, and new variants that are likely to be identified using state-of the art next-generation sequencing-based methods. Furthermore, self-identified ethnicity is associated with a number of ethnicity-related attributes and non-genetic factors that potentially influence the risk of phenoconversion (genotype-phenotype discordance), which may adversely impact the success of genotype-based prescribing decisions. Therefore, while genotype-based prescribing decisions are important in implementing precision medicine, ethnicity should not be disregarded.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify molecular prognostic factors and potentially actionable mutations in ampulla of Vater cancer (AVC).; BACKGROUND: The largely variable outcomes of AVCs make clinical decisions difficult regarding the need of postsurgical therapy, which is based on morphological and immunohistochemical classification that do not adequately consider the varying degrees of heterogeneity present in many AVCs. No approved targeted therapies for AVC exist, but some show promising results requiring better molecular characterization to identify potential responders.; METHODS: We assessed 80 AVCs for the prognostic value of mutations of kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS), B rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), TP53, and 4 membrane erythroblastosis oncogene B (ERBB) receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR-ERBB1, HER2-ERBB2, HER3-ERBB3, HER4-ERBB4) amenable to pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, we evaluated mutations in 16 key components of rat sarcoma (RAS), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), protein 53 (P53), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and wingless/integrated (WNT) pathways, recently associated to AVC by whole-exome sequencing.; RESULTS: TP53 and KRAS were mutated in 41% and 35% of cases, respectively, and emerged as independent prognostic factors together with tumor stage and regardless of the histotype (TP53: P = 0.0006; KRAS: P = 0.0018; stage IIB: P = 0.0117; stage III-IV: P = 0.0020). ERBB, WNT and PI3K pathway genes were mutated in 37.5% of cases.; CONCLUSIONS: KRAS and TP53 mutations are negative predictors of survival in AVCs, regardless of histotype. Potentially actionable mutations in ERBB, WNT, and PI3K signaling pathway genes are present in 37.5% of all cases. These might be amenable to target therapy using available drugs like Everolimus in PI3K-mutated cases or compounds under active screening against ERBB and WNT signaling.

AB Tumor heterogeneity is a major factor in glioblastoma's poor response to therapy and seemingly inevitable recurrence. Only two glioblastoma drugs have received Food and Drug Administration approval since 1998, highlighting the urgent need for new therapies. Profiling "omics" analyses have helped characterize glioblastoma molecularly and have thus identified multiple molecular targets for precision medicine. These molecular targets have influenced clinical trial design; many "actionable" mutation-focused trials are underway, but because they have not yet led to therapeutic breakthroughs, new strategies for treating glioblastoma, especially those with a pharmacological functional component, remain in high demand. In that regard, high-throughput screening that allows for expedited preclinical drug testing and the use of GBM models that represent tumor heterogeneity more accurately than traditional cancer cell lines is necessary to maximize the successful translation of agents into the clinic. High-throughput screening has been successfully used in the testing, discovery, and validation of potential therapeutics in various cancer models, but it has not been extensively utilized in glioblastoma models. In this report, we describe the basic aspects of high-throughput screening and propose a modified high-throughput screening model in which ex vivo and in vivo drug testing is complemented by post-screening pharmacological, pan-omic analysis to expedite anti-glioma drugs' preclinical testing and develop predictive biomarker datasets that can aid in personalizing glioblastoma therapy and inform clinical trial design.

AB There are limited data regarding the molecular characterization of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS; formerly malignant fibrous histiocytoma). This study aimed to investigate the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) in UPS to identify subsets of patients who harbour actionable mutations. Patients diagnosed with UPS underwent pathological re-evaluation by a pathologist specializing in sarcoma. Tumor DNA was isolated from archived fresh frozen tissue samples and genotyped using NGS with the Illumina MiSeq TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (48 genes, 212 amplicons). In total, 95 patients initially classified with UPS were identified. Following pathology re-review the histological subtypes were reclassified to include: Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS, N = 44); UPS(N = 18); and Others (N = 27; including undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma (N = 15) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (N = 6)). Seven cases were excluded from further analysis for other reasons. Baseline demographics of the finalized cohort (N = 88) showed a median age of 66 years (32-95), primarily with stage I-III disease (92%) and high-grade (86%) lesions. Somatic mutations were identified in 31 cases (35%)(Total mutations=36: solitary mutation(n = 27); two mutations( =n = 3); three mutations(n = 1)). The most commonly identified mutations were in TP53 (n=24), ATM (n = 3) and PIK3CA (n=2). Three of 43 patients with MFS and one of 18 patients with UPS had clinically relevant mutations, mainly related to biomarkers of prediction of response; however few had targetable driver mutations. Somatic mutation status did not influence disease free or overall survival. Based on the small number of clinically relevant mutations, these data do not support the routine use of targeted NGS panels outside of research protocols in UPS. © 2017 UICC.

AB CONTEXT: For most programs, whether funded through governmental agencies or nongovernmental organizations, demonstrating the impact of implemented activities is vital to ensuring continued funding and support.; OBJECTIVE: Program evaluation is a critical tool that serves the dual purpose of describing impact and identifying areas for program improvement. From a funder's perspective, describing the individual and collective impact of state-based programs can be challenging due to variations in strategies being implemented and types of data being collected.; DESIGN: A case study was used to describe the actionable, mixed-methods evaluation of the Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program (Core VIPP), including how the evaluation design and approach shifted to address evolving challenges faced by award recipients over time. Particular emphasis is given to innovative methods for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data for key state and federal stakeholders.; RESULTS: The results of the Core VIPP evaluation showed how this funding played a vital role in building injury and violence prevention capacity in state health departments, leading to a decrease in both intermediate and long-term outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned through the mixed-method evaluation of the Core VIPP informed the structure of the subsequent funding cycle (Core SVIPP) to include more prescriptive requirements for evidence-based implementation and a state support team structure for delivery of training and technical assistance.

AB Accelerating the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle in synthetic biology is critical to achieving rapid and facile bioengineering of organisms for the production of, e.g., biofuels and other chemicals. The Learn phase involves using data obtained from the Test phase to inform the next Design phase. As part of the Learn phase, mathematical models of metabolic fluxes give a mechanistic level of comprehension to cellular metabolism, isolating the principle drivers of metabolic behavior from the peripheral ones, and directing future experimental designs and engineering methodologies. Furthermore, the measurement of intracellular metabolic fluxes is specifically noteworthy as providing a rapid and easy-to-understand picture of how carbon and energy flow throughout the cell. Here, we present a detailed guide to performing metabolic flux analysis in the Learn phase of the DBTL cycle, where we show how one can take the isotope labeling data from a 13C labeling experiment and immediately turn it into a determination of cellular fluxes that points in the direction of genetic engineering strategies that will advance the metabolic engineering process.For our modeling purposes we use the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) Quantitative Metabolic Modeling (jQMM) library, which provides an open-source, python-based framework for modeling internal metabolic fluxes and making actionable predictions on how to modify cellular metabolism for specific bioengineering goals. It presents a complete toolbox for performing different types of flux analysis such as Flux Balance Analysis, 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis, and it introduces the capability to use 13C labeling experimental data to constrain comprehensive genome-scale models through a technique called two-scale 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (2S-13C MFA) [1]. In addition to several other capabilities, the jQMM is also able to predict the effects of knockouts using the MoMA and ROOM methodologies. The use of the jQMM library is illustrated through a step-by-step demonstration, which is also contained in a digital Jupyter Notebook format that enhances reproducibility and provides the capability to be adopted to the user's specific needs. As an open-source software project, users can modify and extend the code base and make improvements at will, providing a base for future modeling efforts.

AB Discovering disease pathways, which can be defined as sets of proteins associated with a given disease, is an important problem that has the potential to provide clinically actionable insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Computational methods aid the discovery by relying on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. They start with a few known disease-associated proteins and aim to find the rest of the pathway by exploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the success of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well understood. Here we study the PPI network structure of 519 disease pathways. We find that 90% of pathways do not correspond to single well-connected components in the PPI network. Instead, proteins associated with a single disease tend to form many separate connected components/regions in the network. We then evaluate state-of-the-art disease pathway discovery methods and show that their performance is especially poor on diseases with disconnected pathways. Thus, we conclude that network connectivity structure alone may not be sufficient for disease pathway discovery. However, we show that higher-order network structures, such as small subgraphs of the pathway, provide a promising direction for the development of new methods.

AB There is an expanding and intensive focus on the accessibility, reproducibility, and rigor of basic, clinical, and translational research. This focus complements the need to identify sustainable ways to generate actionable research results that improve human health. The principles and practices of open science offer a promising path to address both issues by facilitating: 1) increased transparency of data and methods which promotes research reproducibility and rigor; and 2) cumulative efficiencies wherein research tools and the output of research are combined to accelerate the delivery of new knowledge. While great strides have been in made in terms of enabling the open science paradigm in the biological sciences, progress in sharing of patient-derived health data has been more moderate. This lack of widespread access to common and well characterized health data is a substantial impediment to the timely, efficient, and multi-disciplinary conduct of translational research, particularly in those instances where hypotheses spanning multiple scales (from molecules to patients to populations) are being developed and tested. To address such challenges, we review current best practices and lessons learned, and explore the need for policy changes and technical innovation that can enhance the sharing of health data for translational research.

AB A growing number of academic and community clinics are conducting genomic testing to inform treatment decisions for cancer patients (1). In the last 3-5 years, there has been a rapid increase in clinical use of next generation sequencing (NGS) based cancer molecular diagnostic (MolDx) testing (2). The increasing availability and decreasing cost of tumor genomic profiling means that physicians can now make treatment decisions armed with patient-specific genetic information. Accumulating research in the cancer biology field indicates that there is significant potential to improve cancer patient outcomes by effectively leveraging this rich source of genomic data in treatment planning (3). To achieve truly personalized medicine in oncology, it is critical to catalog cancer sequence variants from MolDx testing for their clinical relevance along with treatment information and patient outcomes, and to do so in a way that supports large-scale data aggregation and new hypothesis generation. One critical challenge to encoding variant data is adopting a standard of annotation of those variants that are clinically actionable. Through the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) (4), in collaboration with NLM's ClinVar database and >50 academic and industry based cancer research organizations, we developed the Minimal Variant Level Data (MVLD) framework to standardize reporting and interpretation of drug associated alterations (5). We are currently involved in collaborative efforts to align the MVLD framework with parallel, complementary sequence variants interpretation clinical guidelines from the Association of Molecular Pathologists (AMP) for clinical labs (6). In order to truly democratize access to MolDx data for care and research needs, these standards must be harmonized to support sharing of clinical cancer variants. Here we describe the processes and methods developed within the ClinGen's Somatic WG in collaboration with over 60 cancer care and research organizations as well as CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical testing labs to develop standards for cancer variant interpretation and sharing.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: High-throughput measurement technologies have triggered a rise in large-scale cancer studies containing multiple levels of molecular data. While there are a number of efficient methods to analyze individual data types, there are far less that enhance data interpretation after analysis. We present the R package Director, a dynamic visualization approach to linking and interrogating multiple levels of molecular data after analysis for clinically meaningful, actionable insights.; METHODS: Sankey diagrams are traditionally used to represent quantitative flows through multiple, distinct events. Regulation can be interpreted as a flow of biological information through a series of molecular interactions. Functions in Director introduce novel drawing capabilities to make Sankey diagrams robust to a wide range of quantitative measures and to depict molecular interactions as regulatory cascades. The package streamlines creation of diagrams using as input quantitative measurements identifying nodes as molecules of interest and paths as the interaction strength between two molecules.; RESULTS: Director's utility is demonstrated with quantitative measurements of candidate microRNA-gene networks identified in an ovarian cancer dataset. A recent study reported eight miRNAs as master regulators of signature genes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Sankey diagrams generated with data from this study furthers interpretation of the miRNAs' roles by revealing potential co-regulatory behavior in the extracellular matrix (ECM). An additional analysis identified 32 genes differentially expressed between good and poor prognosis patients in four significant pathways (FDR  ≤  0.1), three of which support a complementary role of the ECM in ovarian cancer. The resulting diagram created with Director suggest elevated levels of COL11A1, INHBA, and THBS2 - a signature feature of metastasis [1] - and decreased levels of their targeting miRNAs define poor prognosis.; CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a visualization approach suitable for implementation in an analysis workflow, linking multiple levels of molecular data to gain novel perspective on candidate biomarkers in a complex disease. The diagrams are dynamic, easily replicable, and rendered locally as HTML files to facilitate sharing. The R package Director is simple to use and widely available on all operating systems through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/Director) and GitHub (http://kzouchka.github.io/Director).

AB Objective: Provider acceptance and associated patient outcomes are widely discussed in the evaluation of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs), but critical design criteria for tools have generally been overlooked. The objective of this work is to inform electronic health record alert optimization and clinical practice workflow by identifying, compiling, and reporting design recommendations for CDSS to support the efficient, effective, and timely delivery of high-quality care.; Material and Methods: A narrative review was conducted from 2000 to 2016 in PubMed and The Journal of Human Factors and Ergonomics Society to identify papers that discussed/recommended design features of CDSSs that are associated with the success of these systems.; Results: Fourteen papers were included as meeting the criteria and were found to have a total of 42 unique recommendations; 11 were classified as interface features, 10 as information features, and 21 as interaction features.; Discussion: Features are defined and described, providing actionable guidance that can be applied to CDSS development and policy. To our knowledge, no reviews have been completed that discuss/recommend design features of CDSS at this scale, and thus we found that this was important for the body of literature. The recommendations identified in this narrative review will help to optimize design, organization, management, presentation, and utilization of information through presentation, content, and function. The designation of 3 categories (interface, information, and interaction) should be further evaluated to determine the critical importance of the categories. Future work will determine how to prioritize them with limited resources for designers and developers in order to maximize the clinical utility of CDSS.; Conclusion: This review will expand the field of knowledge and provide a novel organization structure to identify key recommendations for CDSS.

AB The return of individual research results and incidental findings from biobanking research is a much debated ethical issue globally but has extensive relevance in India where the burden of out of pocket health care expenses is high for the majority. The views of 21 ethics committee (EC) members and 22 researchers from Bengaluru, India, concerning the ethics of biobanking research were sought through in-depth interviews using an unfolding case vignette with probes. A shared view among most was that individual research results which are 'actionable' or have 'clinical significance' should be returned to the sample contributors through their treating physicians. This was seen as an ethical obligation and a moral duty on the side of the researcher to "give back" to the person who contributed to the research. The challenges foreseen were that of resources, both financial and personnel, for the time and counseling needed to accompany the disclosure of results. Perceptions of 'ownership' appear to influence the concept of benefit sharing. While benefit sharing in financial terms was considered ethically challenging, certain researchers and ethics committee members made a case for "two way altruism" where the researcher in return for the altruistic 'valuable contribution', shares with the contributor/ community, benefits of the research which could include research findings, improved patient care, and more affordable access to the new diagnostic tests or products arising from the research. This defines the emerging ethic of "giving back" which goes beyond individual rights and ensures reciprocity and distributive justice. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health care. Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.

AB Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is a metabolic enzyme implicated in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. This is underscored by the detection of functional, somatic IDH1 mutations frequently found in secondary glioblastoma. To our knowledge, there has never been a reported, validated case of an IDH1 mutation in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Herein, we present a case of a patient with metastatic PDA that harbored a potentially actionable, albeit rare, IDH1 mutation. As part of the Know Your Tumor project (Pancreatic Cancer Action Network), a 48-year-old female was diagnosed with metastatic PDA and subsequently started on standard of care chemotherapy, during which her hepatic lesions progressed. Detailed molecular profiling was performed on a biopsy from a liver lesion that demonstrated an IDH1 mutation, R132H. This mutation was confirmed by an independent sequencing reaction from the tumor sample, and by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific for the IDH1 R132H mutation. The patient subsequently received a mutant IDH1 inhibitor (AG-120, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), but with no response. IDH1 mutations are common in certain cancer types, but have not been reported in PDA. We report the first case of an IDH1 mutation in this tumor type, perhaps providing a rare opportunity for a targeted therapy as a treatment option for PDA.

AB This paper concerns the development of a design methodology and its demonstration through a prototype system for performance modeling and optimization of manufacturing processes. The design methodology uses a Modelica simulation tool serving as the graphical user interface for manufacturing domain users such as process engineers to formulate their problems. The Process Analytics Formalism, developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, serves as a bridge between the Modelica classes and a commercial optimization solver. The prototype system includes (1) manufacturing model components' libraries created by using Modelica and the Process Analytics Formalism, and (2) a translator of the Modelica classes to Process Analytics Formalism, which are then compiled to mathematical programming models and solved using an optimization solver. This paper provides an experiment toward the goal of enabling manufacturing users to intuitively formulate process performance models, solve problems using optimization-based methods, and automatically get actionable recommendations.

AB Recent work demonstrates that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors harbor countless genomic aberrations that control many hallmarks of cancer. While some specific mutations in CRPC may be actionable, many others are not. We hypothesized that genomic aberrations in cancer may operate in concert to promote drug resistance and tumor progression, and that organization of these genomic aberrations into therapeutically targetable pathways may improve our ability to treat CRPC. To identify the molecular underpinnings of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC, we performed transcriptional and copy number profiling studies using paired enzalutamide-sensitive and resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines. Gene networks associated with enzalutamide resistance were revealed by performing an integrative genomic analysis with the PAthway Representation and Analysis by Direct Reference on Graphical Models (PARADIGM) tool. Amongst the pathways enriched in the enzalutamide-resistant cells were those associated with MEK, EGFR, RAS, and NFKB. Functional validation studies of 64 genes identified 10 candidate genes whose suppression led to greater effects on cell viability in enzalutamide-resistant cells as compared to sensitive parental cells. Examination of a patient cohort demonstrated that several of our functionally-validated gene hits are deregulated in metastatic CRPC tumor samples, suggesting that they may be clinically relevant therapeutic targets for patients with enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. Altogether, our approach demonstrates the potential of integrative genomic analyses to clarify determinants of drug resistance and rational co-targeting strategies to overcome resistance.

AB OBJECTIVES: To develop an actionable test using fluorescence capillary electrophoresis (FCE) to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of histologically similar low-grade lesions (LGLs) to identify high-risk lesions for oral cancer progression.; STUDY DESIGN: To determine the cutoffs of LOH, the FCE results of 52 surgical margin samples were used to compare with the existing LOH results from the previously validated 32 P-GE approach. Using the developed FCE workflow, an independent set of 102 LGLs with known progression status was used to determine the LOH molecular risk (MR) patterns and associated risk of progression.; RESULTS: Using 65% cutoff LOH-FCE, the agreement of LOH-32 P-GE had an average of 82.3% (76.8-87.8). Compared with nonprogressors (n=61), anatomic site and MR patterns (LOH at 9 p21, 3 p14, or 17 p13) were independent risk factors. High-risk profile of tongue and MR3 (LOH at 9 p21 and/or 3 p14 and 17 p13) was significantly associated with progression (hazard ratio [HR] 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-17.6) with specificity of 98.4% at identifying progressors.; CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an objective test using LOH to stratify the risk of LGLs. With further validation, it can be used in the clinical settings to provide clinicians additional information guiding the management of these lesions. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB "No evident disease activity" (NEDA) is a proposed measure of disease activity-free status in multiple sclerosis (MS) that is typically defined as absence of relapses, disability progression, and MRI activity over a defined time period. NEDA is increasingly reported in randomized controlled trials of MS disease modifying therapies where it has some perceived advantages over outcomes such as annualized relapse rate. NEDA has also been proposed as a treatment goal in clinical care. At this point, the long-term implications of early NEDA remain largely unknown. We review current NEDA definitions, use in clinical trials, and its prospects for routine use as an actionable treatment target in clinical practice. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Development of successful therapeutic interventions in Central Nervous Systems (CNS) disorders is a daunting challenge with a low success rate. Probable reasons include the lack of translation from preclinical animal models, the individual variability of many pathological processes converging upon the same clinical phenotype, the pharmacodynamical interaction of various comedications and last but not least the complexity of the human brain. This paper argues for a re-engineering of the pharmaceutical CNS Research & Development strategy using ideas focused on advanced computer modeling and simulation from adjacent engineering-based industries. We provide examples that such a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology approach based on computer simulation of biological processes and that combines the best of preclinical research with actual clinical outcomes can enhance translation to the clinical situation. We will expand upon (1) the need to go from Big Data to Smart Data and develop predictive and quantitative algorithms that are actionable for the pharma industry, (2) using this platform as a "knowledge machine" that captures community-wide expertise in an active hypothesis-testing approach, (3) learning from failed clinical trials and (4) the need to go beyond simple linear hypotheses and embrace complex non-linear hypotheses. We will propose a strategy for applying these concepts to the substantial individual variability of AD patient subgroups and the treatment of neuropsychiatric problems in AD. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology is a new 'humanized' tool for supporting drug discovery and development in general and CNS disorders in particular. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Since the establishment of the Sanger sequencing method, scientists around the world focused their efforts to progress in the field to produce the utmost technology. The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a revolutionary step and promises to lead to massive improvements in our understanding on the role of nucleic acids functions. Cancer research began to use this innovative and highly performing method, and interesting results started to appear in colorectal cancer (CRC) analysis. Several studies produced high-quality data in terms of mutation discovery, especially about actionable or less frequently mutated genes, epigenetics, transcriptomics. Analysis of results is unveiling relevant perspectives aiding to evaluate the response to therapies. Novel evidences have been presented also in other directions such as gut microbiota or CRC circulating tumor cells. However, despite its unquestioned potential, NGS poses some issues calling for additional studies. This review intends to offer a view of the state of the art of NGS applications to CRC through examination of the most important technologies and discussion of recent published results.

AB INTRODUCTION: Clinical practice guidelines facilitate optimal clinical practice. Point of care access, interpretation and application of such guidelines, however, is inconsistent. Informatics-based tools may help clinicians apply guidelines more consistently. We have developed a novel clinical decision support tool that presents guideline-relevant information and actionable items to clinicians at the point of care. We aim to test whether this tool improves the management of hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation and heart failure by primary care clinicians.; METHODS/ANALYSIS: Clinician care teams were cluster randomised to receive access to the clinical decision support tool or passive access to institutional guidelines on 16 May 2016. The trial began on 1 June 2016 when access to the tool was granted to the intervention clinicians. The trial will be run for 6months to ensure a sufficient number of patient encounters to achieve 80% power to detect a twofold increase in the primary outcome at the 0.05 level of significance. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of guideline-based recommendations acted on by clinicians for hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation and heart failure. We hypothesise care teams with access to the clinical decision support tool will act on recommendations at a higher rate than care teams in the standard of care arm.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures. Informed consent was obtained from clinicians. A waiver of informed consent and of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorisation for patients managed by clinicians in the study was granted. In addition to publication, results will be disseminated via meetings and newsletters.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02742545. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa (PF) ependymomas (EPNs) in infants less than 1 year of age (iEPN-PF) have a poorer clinical outcome than EPNs in older children. While radiation therapy is the standard of care for the latter, it is withheld in infants to avoid neurotoxicity to immature brain. It is unknown whether the adverse outcome in iEPN-PFs is due to treatment differences or aggressive biology. We examined this question using molecular profiling.; METHODS: Six anaplastic iEPN-PFs were subjected to transcriptomic analysis and FISH for p16 loss and gains of 1q, and compared with anaplastic PF EPNs from older children. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).; RESULTS: All six iEPN-PFs were grouped within EPN PF subgroup A (PFA). E2F targets and G2M checkpoint were identified as the most enriched gene sets in iEPN-PF, which was validated in a larger independent cohort. Accordingly, MIB-1 IHC demonstrated a higher mitotic rate in iEPN-PFs than noninfant anaplastic EPN PFA. Genetic and protein analyses demonstrated that p16 loss and low p16 protein expression is a hallmark of iEPN-PF, and that none harbored 1q gains. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the poorer clinical outcome of the iEPN-PF cohort.; CONCLUSIONS: Biological differences, characterized by loss of p16 expression without gains of 1q in iEPN-PFs, as well as deregulated E2F target gene transcription, are indicative of deregulated p16-CDK4/6-pRB-E2F pathway activity. This may underlie the poor clinical outcome seen in this group of iEPN-PFs, rather than the withholding of radiation therapy. Results suggest a potential actionable therapy for iEPN-PF, namely cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Combined and complex dystonias are heterogeneous movement disorders combining dystonia with other motor and/or systemic signs. Although we are beginning to understand the diverse molecular causes of these disease entities, clinical pattern recognition and conventional genetic workup achieve an etiological diagnosis only in a minority of cases. Our goal was to provide a window into the variable genetic origins and distinct clinical patterns of combined/complex dystonia more broadly. Between August 2016 and January 2017, we applied whole-exome sequencing to a cohort of nine patients with varied combined and/or complex dystonic presentations, being on a diagnostic odyssey. Bioinformatics analyses, co-segregation studies, and sequence-interpretation algorithms were employed to detect causative mutations. Comprehensive clinical review was undertaken to define the phenotypic spectra and optimal management strategies. On average, we observed a delay in diagnosis of 23years before whole-exome analysis enabled determination of each patient's genetic defect. Whereas mutations in ACTB, ATP1A3, ADCY5, and SGCE were associated with particular phenotypic clues, trait manifestations arising from mutations in PINK1, MRE11A, KMT2B, ATM, and SLC6A1 were different from those previously reported in association with these genes. Apart from improving counseling for our entire cohort, genetic findings had actionable consequences on preventative measures and therapeutic interventions for five patients. Our investigation confirms unique genetic diagnoses, highlights key clinical features and phenotypic expansions, and suggests whole-exome sequencing as a first-tier diagnostic for combined/complex dystonia. These results might stimulate independent teams to extend the scope of agnostic genetic screening to this particular phenotypic group that remains poorly characterized through existing studies.

AB Background Risk-based monitoring is a concept endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration to improve clinical trial data quality by focusing monitoring efforts on critical data elements and higher risk investigator sites. BIOTRONIK approached this by implementing a comprehensive strategy that assesses risk and data quality through a combination of operational controls and data surveillance. This publication demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven risk assessment methodology when used in conjunction with a tailored monitoring plan. Methods We developed a data-driven risk assessment system to rank 133 investigator sites comprising 3442 subjects and identify those sites that pose a potential risk to the integrity of data collected in implantable cardiac device clinical trials. This included identification of specific risk factors and a weighted scoring mechanism. We conducted trend analyses for risk assessment data collected over 1year to assess the overall impact of our data surveillance process combined with other operational monitoring efforts. Results Trending analyses of key risk factors revealed an improvement in the quality of data collected during the observation period. The three risk factors follow-up compliance rate, unavailability of critical data, and noncompliance rate correspond closely with Food and Drug Administration's risk-based monitoring guidance document. Among these three risk factors, 100% (12/12) of quantiles analyzed showed an increase in data quality. Of these, 67% (8/12) of the improving trends in worst performing quantiles had p-values less than 0.05, and 17% (2/12) had p-values between 0.05 and 0.06. Among the poorest performing site quantiles, there was a statistically significant decrease in subject follow-up noncompliance rates, protocol noncompliance rates, and incidence of missing critical data. Conclusion One year after implementation of a comprehensive strategy for risk-based monitoring, including a data-driven risk assessment methodology to target on-site monitoring visits, statistically significant improvement was seen in a majority of measurable risk factors at the worst performing site quantiles. For the three risk factors which are most critical to the overall compliance of cardiac rhythm management medical device studies: follow-up compliance rate, unavailability of critical data, and noncompliance rate, we measured significant improvement in data quality. Although the worst performing site quantiles improved but not significantly in some risk factors such as subject attrition, the data-driven risk assessment highlighted key areas on which to continue focusing both on-site and centralized monitoring efforts. Data-driven surveillance of clinical trial performance provides actionable observations that can improve site performance. Clinical trials utilizing risk-based monitoring by leveraging a data-driven quality assessment combined with specific operational procedures may lead to an improvement in data quality and resource efficiencies.

AB Background: On the basis of historical data, patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP) are generally assumed to have a dismal prognosis with overall survival of less than 1year. Treatment is typically cytotoxic chemotherapy guided by histologic features and the pattern of metastatic spread. The purpose of this study was to provide a clinical and pathologic description of patients with CUP in the modern era, to define the frequency of clinically actionable molecular alterations in this population, to determine how molecular testing can alter therapeutic decisions, and to investigate novel uses of next-generation sequencing in the evaluation and treatment of patients with CUP.; Patients and methods: Under Institutional Review Board approval, we identified all CUP patients evaluated at our institution over a recent 2-year period. We documented demographic information, clinical outcomes, pathologic evaluations, next-generation sequencing of available tumor tissue, use of targeted therapies, and clinical trial enrollment.; Results: We identified 333 patients with a diagnosis of CUP evaluated at our institution from 1 January 2014 through 30 June 2016. Of these patients, 150 had targeted next-generation sequencing carried out on available tissue. Median overall survival in this cohort was 13months. Forty-five of 150 (30%) patients had potentially targetable genomic alterations identified by tumor molecular profiling, and 15 of 150 (10%) received targeted therapies. Dominant mutation signatures were identified in 21 of 150 (14%), largely implicating exogenous mutagen exposures such as ultraviolet radiation and tobacco.; Conclusions: Patients with CUP represent a heterogeneous population, harboring a variety of potentially targetable alterations. Next-generation sequencing may provide an opportunity for CUP patients to benefit from novel personalized therapies. © The Author 2017.

AB Background: Real-time knowledge of the somatic genome can influence management of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). While routine metastatic tissue biopsy is challenging in mCRPC, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive tool to sample the tumor genome. However, no systematic comparisons of matched "liquid" and "solid" biopsies have been performed that would enable ctDNA profiling to replace the need for direct tissue sampling.; Methods: We performed targeted sequencing across 72 clinically relevant genes in 45 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples collected at time of metastatic tissue biopsy. We compared ctDNA alterations with exome sequencing data generated from matched tissue and quantified the concordance of mutations and copy number alterations using the Fisher exact test and Pearson correlations.; Results: Seventy-five point six percent of cfDNA samples had a ctDNA proportion greater than 2% of total cfDNA. In these patients, all somatic mutations identified in matched metastatic tissue biopsies were concurrently present in ctDNA. Furthermore, the hierarchy of variant allele fractions for shared mutations was remarkably similar between ctDNA and tissue. Copy number profiles between matched liquid and solid biopsy were highly correlated, and individual copy number calls in clinically actionable genes were 88.9% concordant. Detected alterations included AR amplifications in 22 (64.7%) samples, SPOP mutations in three (8.8%) samples, and inactivating alterations in tumor suppressors TP53 , PTEN , RB1 , APC , CDKN1B , BRCA2 , and PIK3R1 . In several patients, ctDNA sequencing revealed robust changes not present in paired solid biopsy, including clinically relevant alterations in the AR, WNT, and PI3K pathways.; Conclusions: Our study shows that, in the majority of patients, a ctDNA assay is sufficient to identify all driver DNA alterations present in matched metastatic tissue and supports development of DNA biomarkers to guide mCRPC patient management based on ctDNA alone. © The Author 2017.

AB Purpose: Clear cell Renal Cell Carcinomas (ccRCC), the largest group of renal tumours, are resistant to classical therapies. The determination of the functional state of actionable biomarkers for the assessment of these adenocarcinomas is essential. The dysregulation of the oncoprotein, PKB/Akt has been linked with poor prognoses in human cancers.; Material & methods: We analysed the status of the PKB/Akt pathway in a representative tumour tissue microarray obtained from the primary tumours and their metastases in 60 ccRCC with long term follow up. We sought to define the evolution of this pathway from the primary tumour to the metastatic event and to know the impact of its functional state in tumour aggressiveness and patient survival. Two-site time resolved amplified FRET (A-FRET) was utilised for assessing the activation state of PKB/Akt and this was compared to conventional immunohistochemistry measurements.; Results: Activation state of PKB/Akt in primary tumours defined by A-FRET correlated with poorer overall survival (hazard ratio 0.228; p=0.002). Whereas, increased protein expression of phosphoPKB/Akt, identified using classical immunohistochemistry, yielded no significant difference (hazard ratio 1.390; p=0.548).; Conclusions: Quantitative determination of PKB/Akt activation in ccRCC primary tumours alongside other diagnostics tools could prove key in taking oncologists closer to an efficient personalised therapy in ccRCC patients.; General significance: The quantitative imaging technology based on Amplified-FRET can rapidly analyse protein activation states and molecular interactions. It could be used for prognosis and assess drug function during the early cycles of chemotherapy. It enables evaluation of clinical efficiency of personalised cancer treatment.

AB More than 50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor an actionable mutation, and molecular testing at different intervals can help in personalized and targeted treatment. Core tissue biopsy and needle biopsy done at the time of diagnosis/disease progression are interventional, time-consuming and can affect the patients adversely. Noninterventional biomarker testing by liquid biopsy promises to revolutionize advanced stage cancer screening. The present report was formulated based on an expert panel meeting of renowned oncologists who gave their opinions for minimally invasive liquid biopsy to detect targetable molecular biomarkers in advanced NSCLC cases. An exhaustive literature search was done to support their recommendations. Clinical utility of minimally invasive liquid biopsy, for detection of molecular biomarkers in advanced stage NSCLC patients, was broadly discussed by the key opinion leaders.

AB Resistance to 1st or 2nd generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) - tyrosine kinases (TKIs) develops predominantly due to an acquired mutation, EGFR T790M. Third-generation EGFR-TKIs have demonstrated potent activity against TKI resistance mediated by EGFR T790M. Thus, it become critical to identify T790M mutation on disease progression. Analysis of tumor tissue biopsy material is considered as gold standard for mutation detection. However, lung re-biopsy in a progressed patient involves several challenges - access to tumor, patient's willingness, safety, cost. Minimally invasive plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) evolved as an alternative for detection of EGFR T790M mutation when tumor genotyping is not feasible. Although a positive T790M result from ctDNA analysis is actionable, caution should be exercised in interpreting negative plasma results. A negative result may imply the absence of a mutation or merely that a patient's tumor is not shedding ctDNA at detectable levels, thus necessitating a confirmatory tissue biopsy to rule out a false negative plasma result. In this case report, we described a 78-year-old female who underwent a reflexed tumor biopsy and tissue based testing upon negative plasma genotyping. Our case report exhibited the importance to follow proposed T790M plasma testing algorithm to screen eligible patients for 3rd generation TKI therapy.

AB Faster and more widespread implementation could help more patients to benefit more quickly from known effective treatments. So could more effective implementation of better assessment methods, service delivery models, treatments and services. Implementation at scale and 'descaling' are ways for hospitals and health systems to respond to rising demands and costs. The paper proposes ways to provide leaders with the information that would help them to decide whether and how to scale up a proven improvement. We draw on our knowledge of the improvement and implementation literature on the subject and on our experience of scale up programs in Kaiser Permanente, in Swedish county health systems, and in international health. We describe a '3S' scale up infrastructure and other ingredients that appear necessary for successful widespread improvement, and list the resources that we have found useful for developing scale up programs. The paper aims to encourage more actionable research into scale up, and shows the opportunities for researchers to both advance implementation and improvement science and contribute to reducing suffering and costs in a more timely and effective way. © The Author 2017.

AB Background: In 2013, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) transitioned into a new accreditation system to reduce burden, focus on outcomes, and promote innovation and improvement. One component is a self-study that includes aims, an environmental assessment, and setting improvement priorities. The ACGME initiated voluntary site visits following the self-study.; Objective: We explored common themes in program aims and assessment of their environment.; Methods: Using grounded theory, inductive and deductive qualitative methods, and truth grounding, we analyzed data from voluntary site visits of 396 core and subspecialty programs between June 2015 and September 2017, with a focus on common themes.; Results: We report common themes for aims and the dimensions of the environmental assessment. Themes for strengths include a collegial, supportive learning environment; responsive leaders; and experiences that prepare residents for unsupervised practice. Improvement priorities encompass low learner engagement and "content mismatch" in didactic education, balancing education and service at a time of growing clinical volumes, and improving the utility of assessment systems. Common opportunities encompass collaborations that improve education, involving alumni and harnessing technology to enrich education, while threats include an unsustainable effort for many program leaders, clinical pressures on faculty, and loss of external sites important for education. Linked dimensions of the environmental assessment suggest benefit in a growing focus on learners, and approaches to ensure a humanistic learning environment that allows for growth, self-determination, and inclusion.; Conclusions: The findings highlight actionable themes for the environmental assessment. We discuss implications for programs, institutions, and the ACGME.

AB Most newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS)±radiation therapy (RT). A key challenge is deciding whether or not to include RT with BCS. This decision is often determined by the degree of risk associated with disease recurrence. However, methods for risk assessment have not kept pace with diagnostic advances. The DCIS Score is an independent predictor and quantifier of individualized recurrence risk in patients with DCIS. Although the test is the only available genomic classifier for DCIS, the degree of adoption is varied, and it has not yet been fully accepted as standard practice. Recognizing the importance of individualizing recurrence assessment in patients with DCIS, the authors convened to review relevant clinical data, share best practices, and establish recommendations regarding how the assay should be incorporated into the decision-making process. Based on their clinical experiences, the authors concluded that effective integration of the DCIS Score should involve shared decision-making between surgeons and other specialties (radiation oncologists, pathologists, patient navigators, and physician assistants), with the patient's preference being a primary consideration. This manuscript aims to provide easy-to-use, clear-cut, and practical guidance to help physicians utilize the DCIS Score to improve risk assessment and inform treatment decisions for their patients with DCIS, including how to understand, run, interpret, and communicate the actionable results to patients. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
