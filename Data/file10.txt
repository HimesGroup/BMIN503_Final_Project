AB This review describes methods used in comparative effectiveness research (CER). The aim of CER is to improve decisions that affect medical care at the levels of both policy and the individual. The key elements of CER are (a) head-to-head comparisons of active treatments, (b) study populations typical of day-to-day clinical practice, and (c) a focus on evidence to inform care tailored to the characteristics of individual patients. These requirements will stress the principal methods of CER: observational research, randomized trials, and decision analysis. Observational studies are especially vulnerable because they use data that directly reflect the decisions made in usual practice. CER will challenge researchers and policy makers to think deeply about how to extract more actionable information from the vast enterprise of the daily practice of medicine. Fortunately, the methods are largely applicable to research in the public health system, which should therefore benefit from the intense interest in CER.

AB BACKGROUND: Risk-standardized all-cause 30-day readmission rates (RSRRs) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been endorsed as a national measure of hospital quality. Little is known about variation in the performance of hospitals on this measure, and whether high hospital rates of readmission after PCI are due to modifiable deficiencies in quality of care has not been assessed.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated 30-day, all-cause RSRRs for all nonfederal PCI-performing hospitals in Massachusetts, adjusted for clinical and angiographic variables, between 2005 and 2008. We assessed if differences in race, insurance type, and PCI and post-PCI characteristics, including procedural complications and discharge characteristics, could explain variation between hospitals using nested hierarchical logistic regression models. Of 36 060 patients undergoing PCI at 24 hospitals and surviving to discharge, 4469 (12.4%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Hospital RSRRs ranged from 9.5% to 17.9%, with 8 of 24 hospitals being identified as outliers (4 lower than expected and 4 higher than expected). Differences in race, insurance, PCI, and post-PCI factors accounted for 10.4% of the between-hospital variance in RSRRs.; CONCLUSIONS: We observed wide variation in hospital 30-day all-cause RSRRs after PCI, most of which could not be explained by identifiable differences in procedural and postprocedural factors. A better understanding of etiologies of hospital variation is necessary to determine whether this measure is an actionable assessment of hospital quality, and, if so, how hospitals might improve their performance.

AB Lung cancer continues to be the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and other developed countries. The most common subtype is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Within NSCLC, we are discovering remarkable molecular heterogeneity. Most current actionable mutations have been identified in patients with adenocarcinoma histology, but now new mutations are being discovered in squamous cell histology patients as well. This molecular heterogeneity provides an opportunity for clinical trials to exploit various candidate oncogene-addicted pathways in NSCLC. This article focuses on 2 shifting paradigms in NSCLC management: the recent advances in targeted therapy and maintenance treatment.

AB Robust, active cooperation, and effective, open communication between all stakeholders is essential for ensuring regulatory compliance and healthcare product safety; avoiding the necessity for whistle-blowing; and, most essentially, meeting the transparency requirements of public trust.The focus here is on what can be done within a healthcare product organization (HPO) to achieve actionable, sustainable policies and practices such as leadership, management, and supervision role-modelling of best practice; ongoing process review and improvements in every department; protection of those who report concerns through robust policies endorsed at Board level throughout an organization to eliminate the fear of retaliation; training in open, non-defensive team-working principles; and mediation structure and process for resolution of differences of opinion or interpretation of contradictory and volatile data.Based on analyses of other safety systems, workplace silence and interpersonal breakdowns are warning signs of defective systems underlying poor compliance and compromising safety. Remedying the situation requires attention to the root causes underlying such symptoms of dysfunction, especially the human factor, i.e. those factors that influence human performance. It is essential that leadership and management listen to employees' concerns about systems and processes, assess them impartially and reward contributions that improve safety.Fundamentally, the safety, transparency, and trustworthiness of HPOs, both commercial and regulatory, can be judged by the extent of the freedom of their staff to 'speak up' when the time is right. This, in turn, consolidates the trust of external stakeholders in the safety of a system and its products. The promotion of 'speaking up' in an organization provides an important safeguard against the risk of poor compliance and the undermining of societal confidence in the safety of healthcare products.

AB Biobanks and archived data sets collecting samples and data have become crucial engines of genetic and genomic research. Unresolved, however, is what responsibilities biobanks should shoulder to manage incidental findings and individual research results of potential health, reproductive, or personal importance to individual contributors (using "biobank" here to refer both to collections of samples and collections of data). This article reports recommendations from a 2-year project funded by the National Institutes of Health. We analyze the responsibilities involved in managing the return of incidental findings and individual research results in a biobank research system (primary research or collection sites, the biobank itself, and secondary research sites). We suggest that biobanks shoulder significant responsibility for seeing that the biobank research system addresses the return question explicitly. When reidentification of individual contributors is possible, the biobank should work to enable the biobank research system to discharge four core responsibilities to (1) clarify the criteria for evaluating findings and the roster of returnable findings, (2) analyze a particular finding in relation to this, (3) reidentify the individual contributor, and (4) recontact the contributor to offer the finding. We suggest that findings that are analytically valid, reveal an established and substantial risk of a serious health condition, and are clinically actionable should generally be offered to consenting contributors. This article specifies 10 concrete recommendations, addressing new biobanks as well as those already in existence.

AB PURPOSE: People are interested in receiving their individual research results in exchange for participating in genetic research. However, it is unclear whether the public understands the nature and limitations of these results and whether they would want information with unknown clinical utility.; METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups in three US cities to examine the types of results people would want and the perceived value of different types of individual research results.; RESULTS: Nearly all focus group participants said they would want at least some individual research results returned. Priority was placed on results that are well understood. Less important to participants were the magnitude of the risk conferred and actionability of the result. In addition to helping treat or prevent disease, participants identified several other potential health-related and personal reasons for wanting individual research results. Many believed that researchers have an obligation to return individual research results. Although most people would prefer to receive as much information as possible, many would accept the return of a limited set of results.; CONCLUSION: Participants understood the nuances and limitations of individual research results. Researchers deciding the value of returning a given result should consider using a broader definition of clinical utility as well as the possible personal utility of the information.

AB PURPOSE: Few studies have examined prescribers' interactions with medication alerts at the point of prescribing. We conducted an in situ, human factors investigation of outpatient prescribing to uncover factors that influence the prescriber-alert interaction and identify strategies to improve alert design.; METHODS: Field observations and interviews were conducted with outpatient prescribers at a major Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Physicians, clinical pharmacists, and nurse practitioners were recruited across five primary care clinics and eight specialty clinics. Prescribers were observed in situ as they ordered medications for patients and resolved alerts. Researchers collected 351 pages of typed notes across 102 hours of observations and interviews. An interdisciplinary team identified emergent themes via inductive qualitative analysis.; RESULTS: Altogether, 320 alerts were observed among 30 prescribers and their interactions with 146 patients. Qualitative analysis uncovered 44 emergent themes and 9 overarching factors, which were organized into a framework that describes the prescriber-alert interaction. Prescribers' ability to act on alerts was impeded by the alert interface, which did not adequately support all prescriber types.; CONCLUSIONS: This empiric study produced a novel framework for understanding the prescriber-alert interaction. Results revealed key components of the alert interface that influence prescribers and indicate a need for more universal design. Actionable design recommendations are presented and may be used to enhance alert design and patient safety. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We propose a shift in emphasis when communicating to people when the objective is to motivate household disaster preparedness actions. This shift is to emphasize the communication of preparedness actions (what to do about risk) rather than risk itself. We have called this perspective "communicating actionable risk," and it is grounded in diffusion of innovations and communication theories. A representative sample of households in the nation was analyzed using a path analytic framework. Preparedness information variables (including content, density, and observation), preparedness mediating variables (knowledge, perceived effectiveness, and milling), and preparedness actions taken were modeled. Clear results emerged that provide a strong basis for communicating actionable risk, and for the conclusion both that information observed (seeing preparedness actions that other have taken) and information received (receiving recommendations about what preparedness actions to take) play key, although different, roles in motivating preparedness actions among the people in our nation. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: We know that patient care can be improved by implementing evidence-based innovations and applying research findings linked to good practice. Successfully implementing innovations in complex organisations, such as the UK's National Health Service (NHS), is often challenging as multiple contextual dynamics mediate the process. Research studies have explored the challenges of introducing innovations into healthcare settings and have contributed to a better understanding of why potentially useful innovations are not always implemented in practice, even if backed by strong evidence. Mediating factors include health policy and health system influences, organisational factors, and individual and professional attitudes, including decision makers' perceptions of innovation evidence. There has been limited research on how different forms of evidence are accessed and utilised by organisational decision makers during innovation adoption. We also know little about how diverse healthcare professionals (clinicians, administrators) make sense of evidence and how this collective sensemaking mediates the uptake of innovations.; METHODS: The study will involve nine comparative case study sites of acute care organisations grouped into three regional clusters across England. Each of the purposefully selected sites represents a variety of trust types and organisational contexts. We will use qualitative methods, in-depth interviews, observation of key meetings, and systematic analysis of relevant secondary data to understand the rationale and challenges involved in sourcing and utilising innovation evidence in the empirical setting of infection prevention and control. We will use theories of innovation adoption and sensemaking in organisations to interpret the data. The research will provide lessons for the uptake and continuous use of innovations in the English and international health systems.; DISCUSSION: Unlike most innovation studies, which involve single-level analysis, our study will explore the innovation-adoption process at multiple embedded levels: micro (individual), meso (organisational), and macro (interorganisational). By comparing and contrasting across the nine sites, each with different organisational contexts, local networks, leadership styles, and different innovations considered for adoption, the findings of the study will have wide relevance. The research will produce actionable findings responding to the political and economic need for healthcare organisations to be innovation-ready.

AB The aim of the paper was to evaluate current emergency contraception (EC) methods and policies in order to implement lessons learned and maximize potential population impact while introducing dedicated EC pills in Croatia. Literature search for potential reasons for EC failing to show positive population impact and detecting actionable points to be implemented in national guidelines. Six potential reasons for ECs failure to show population impact were evaluated and four actionable points were detected: low use of EC compared to the numbers of risk events, low awareness on EC in general population, differences in efficacy of EC methods and EC vailability. In order to ensure EC's population impact in Croatia it is of a critical relevance to establish continuous education programs for population of women at risk. When recommending an EC method, superior efficacy must be a key decision-making criteria therefore cooper IUD and ulipristal acetate should be our primary options. Counseling is a critical step to ensure maximal efficacy of the EC method, but also to encourage future use of regular contraceptives. Finally, national ECP dispension protocol is needed to close the loop from effective women screening, prompt yet appropriate ECP administration/dispensing towards structured follow up after EC pills intake.

AB OBJECTIVE: An expert panel was convened to select practical, valid psychosocial measures for use during National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health field investigations.; METHODS: A taxonomy of psychosocial constructs was developed using existing taxonomies and criteria regarding the malleability, actionability, and validity of constructs. Panel members identified measures for each construct based on their expertise and experience. Measures were selected on the basis of the following criteria: practicality, brevity, validity, availability of existing data, and lack of confounds between psychosocial constructs and outcomes.; RESULTS: The panel came to a consensus in recommending 24 measures representing 22 constructs.; CONCLUSIONS: It is important that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regularly evaluates its methodologies to ensure it is in line with current best practices. The measures identified will be used modularly in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fieldwork depending on the nature of the evaluation request, industry type, and worker population.

AB The mission of HistoRx (CT, USA) is to develop and commercialize clinically actionable immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker assays with the distinctive characteristic of being as quantitative, objective and standardized as the measurement of glucose in blood. In clinical laboratory practice, serum glucose measurement is expected to give the same result regardless of the laboratory or operator performing the test, and the same should be true for tissue-based IHC tests in anatomical pathology. By offering such improvements to standard IHC analysis using reproducible AQUA assays, patients will benefit from standardized results for determination of appropriate targeted therapeutic drug treatment.

AB Critical values in anatomic pathology are rare occurrences and difficult to define with precision. Nevertheless, accrediting institutions require effective and timely communication of all critical values generated by clinical and anatomic laboratories. Provisional gating criteria for potentially critical anatomic diagnoses have been proposed, with some success in their implementation reported in the literature. Ensuring effective communication is challenging, however, making the case for programmatic implementation of a turnkey-style integrated information technology solution. To address this need, we developed a generically deployable laboratory information system-based tool, using a tiered natural language processing predicate calculus inference engine to identify qualifying cases that meet criteria for critical diagnoses but lack an indication in the electronic medical record for an appropriate clinical discussion with the ordering physician of record. Using this tool, we identified an initial cohort of 13,790 cases over a 49-month period, which were further explored by reviewing the available electronic medical record for each patient. Of these cases, 35 (0.3%) were judged to require intervention in the form of direct communication between the attending pathologist and the clinical physician of record. In 8 of the 35 cases, this intervention resulted in the conveyance of new information to the requesting physician and/or a change in the patient's clinical plan. The very low percentage of such cases (0.058%) illustrates their rarity in daily practice, making it unlikely that manual identification/notification approaches alone can reliably manage them. The automated turnkey system was useful in avoiding missed handoffs of significant, clinically actionable diagnoses.

AB In recent years, the increasing awareness that somatic mutations and other genetic aberrations drive human malignancies has led us within reach of personalized cancer medicine (PCM). The implementation of PCM is based on the following premises: genetic aberrations exist in human malignancies; a subset of these aberrations drive oncogenesis and tumor biology; these aberrations are actionable (defined as having the potential to affect management recommendations based on diagnostic, prognostic, and/or predictive implications); and there are highly specific anticancer agents available that effectively modulate these targets. This article highlights the technology underlying cancer genomics and examines the early results of genome sequencing and the challenges met in the discovery of new genetic aberrations. Finally, drawing from experiences gained in a feasibility study of somatic mutation genotyping and targeted exome sequencing led by Princess Margaret Hospital-University Health Network and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the processes, challenges, and issues involved in the translation of cancer genomics to the clinic are discussed.

AB PURPOSE: Return of individual research results from genomic studies is a hotly debated ethical issue in genomic research. However, the perspective of key stakeholders-institutional review board (IRB) professionals-has been missing from this dialogue. This study explores the positions and experiences of IRB members and staff regarding this issue.; METHODS: In-depth interviews with 31 IRB professionals at six sites across the United States.; RESULTS: IRB professionals agreed that research results should be returned to research participants when results are medically actionable but only if the participants want to know the results. Many respondents expected researchers to address the issue of return of results (ROR) in the IRB application and informed-consent document. Many respondents were not comfortable with their expertise in genomics research and only a few described actual experiences in addressing ROR. Although participants agreed that guidelines would be helpful, most were reticent to develop them in isolation. Even where IRB guidance exists (e.g., Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) lab certification required for return), in practice, the guidance has been overruled to allow ROR (e.g., no CLIA lab performs the assay).; CONCLUSION: An IRB-researcher partnership is needed to help inform responsible and feasible institutional approaches to returning research results.

AB BACKGROUND: Learning (quality improvement) collaboratives are effective vehicles for driving coordinated organizational improvements. A central element of a learning collaborative is the change package-a catalogue of strategies, change concepts, and action steps that guide participants in their improvement efforts. Despite a vast literature describing learning collaboratives, little to no information is available on how the guiding strategies, change concepts, and action items are identified and developed to a replicable and actionable format that can be used to make measurable improvements within participating organizations.; METHODS: The process for developing the change package for the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Patient Safety and Clinical Pharmacy Services Collaborative entailed environmental scan and identification of leading practices, case studies, interim debriefing meetings, data synthesis, and a technical expert panel meeting. Data synthesis involved end-of-day debriefings, systematic qualitative analyses, and the use of grounded theory and inductive data analysis techniques. This approach allowed systematic identification of innovative patient safety and clinical pharmacy practices that could be adopted in diverse environments. A case study approach enabled the research team to study practices in their natural environments. Use of grounded theory and inductive data analysis techniques enabled identification of strategies, change concepts, and actionable items that might not have been captured using different approaches.; DISCUSSION: Use of systematic processes and qualitative methods in identification and translation of innovative practices can greatly accelerate the diffusion of innovations and practice improvements. This approach is effective whether or not an individual organization is part of a learning collaborative.

AB While strategies for handling unusual and possibly clinically significant anatomical findings on brain scans of research volunteers have been developed and implemented across neuroimaging laboratories worldwide, few concrete steps have been taken to consider the next frontier: functional anomalies. Drawing on the genetics literature, early work in neuroimaging considered actionability to be a driving force for determining if and when findings should be disclosed to individuals in whom they are detected, as inherent uncertainty raises potential ethical dilemmas of misdiagnosing and mislabelling people as patients. Here we consider the possibility of incidental findings in brain function during the resting state. Our approach does not anchor the resting state as the sine qua non of functional incidental findings, but as a path to thinking about where they may emerge in the future and how our professional communities need to think about thinking about them. We suggest that considering the issues proactively today, within a framework that is maximally flexible and open to modification, is better than responding reactively after the fact and with no framework at all. We argue that there is a duty to consider possible incidental findings despite the ambiguities of data interpretation, while working hard to prevent unnecessary alarm.

AB Endoscope, microscope, and neuronavigation systems are integrated in neurosurgical procedures mainly by using a serial combination algorithm, where, the user must switch his/her field of view from one platform display to another. The integration of theses devices could be optimized by incorporating different displays into one viewing platform thus achieving a parallel combination. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and the applicability of parallel integration of microscopic, endoscopic, and neuronavigation images by real time displaying the endoscope and neuronavigation image datasets in the main operative microscope oculars. The proposed set-up was effective in displaying the three images dataset in an operationally actionable mode. Ergonomically, the ability of using the different image dataset without the need of taking the eyes off the microscope oculars did not disrupt the flow or the tempo of the operative procedure. However, new endoscopes specific to this application are recommended.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to determine whether a combination of baseline features and early post-baseline depressive symptom changes have clinical value in predicting out-patient non-response in depressed out-patients after 8 weeks of medication treatment.; METHOD: We analysed data from the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes study for 447 participants with complete 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) ratings at baseline and at treatment weeks 2, 4 and 8. We used a multi-time point, recursive subsetting approach that included baseline features and changes in QIDS-SR16 scores from baseline to weeks 2 and 4, to identify non-responders (<50% reduction in QIDS-SR16) at week 8 with a pre-specified accuracy level.; RESULTS: Pretreatment clinical features alone were not clinically useful predictors of non-response after 8 weeks of treatment. Baseline to week 2 symptom change identified 48 non-responders (of which 36 were true non-responders). This approach gave a clinically meaningful negative predictive value of 0.75. Symptom change from baseline to week 4 identified 79 non-responders (of which 60 were true non-responders), achieving the same accuracy. Symptom change at both weeks 2 and 4 identified 87 participants (almost 20% of the sample) as non-responders with the same accuracy. More participants with chronic than non-chronic index episodes could be accurately identified by week 4.; CONCLUSIONS: Specific baseline clinical features combined with symptom changes by weeks 2-4 can provide clinically actionable results, enhancing the efficiency of care by personalizing the treatment of depression.

AB BACKGROUND: Companies are currently marketing personal genome tests directly-to-consumer that provide genetic susceptibility testing for a range of multifactorial diseases simultaneously. As these tests comprise multiple risk analyses for multiple diseases, they may be difficult to evaluate. Insight into morally relevant differences between diseases will assist researchers, healthcare professionals, policy-makers and other stakeholders in the ethical evaluation of personal genome tests.; DISCUSSION: In this paper, we identify and discuss four disease characteristics--severity, actionability, age of onset, and the somatic/psychiatric nature of disease--and show how these lead to specific ethical issues. By way of illustration, we apply this framework to genetic susceptibility testing for three diseases: type 2 diabetes, age-related macular degeneration and clinical depression. For these three diseases, we point out the ethical issues that are relevant to the question whether it is morally justifiable to offer genetic susceptibility testing to adults or to children or minors, and on what conditions.; SUMMARY: We conclude that the ethical evaluation of personal genome tests is challenging, for the ethical issues differ with the diseases tested for. An understanding of the ethical significance of disease characteristics will improve the ethical, legal and societal debate on personal genome testing.

AB Complete repertoires of molecular activity in and between tissues provided by new high-dimensional "omics" technologies hold great promise for characterizing human physiology at all levels of biological hierarchies. The combined effects of genetic and environmental perturbations at any level of these hierarchies can lead to vicious cycles of pathology and complex systemic diseases. The challenge lies in extracting all relevant information from the rapidly increasing volumes of omics data and translating this information first into knowledge and ultimately into wisdom that can yield clinically actionable results. Here, we discuss how molecular networks are central to the implementation of this new biology in medicine and translation to preventive and personalized health care.

AB Interventions to support evidence-informed decision making have increased in recent years, but they are often fragmented across different clinical, management and policy environments. Many of these efforts also place varying emphasis on supporting the use of research evidence, with some choosing to focus more on expert knowledge and/or media coverage and others focusing on supporting the use of actionable messages arising from high-quality, relevant and optimally packaged research evidence. In this paper, we profile five Canadian contributions--EvidenceUpdates, Rx for Change, Health-Evidence.ca, Health Systems Evidence and the McMaster Health Forum--that allow providers, managers and policy makers to efficiently find and use research evidence when they need it. These contributions are critical for supporting both local and global efforts to provide optimal and cost-effective care, improving the quality of care and strengthening health systems.

AB Seen from the perspective of funding organizations, investors, and the general public, the productivity of our world-wide biomedical research enterprise is declining despite increased investment. This opinion piece suggests a cause and a solution. The cause is the enormous complexity of human biology and pathophysiology. The unsolved human diseases involve so many interacting variables that single research laboratories headed by skilled principal investigators doing innovative experimental work cannot be expected to assemble the reductionist pieces into an integrated working model. Systems biology offers a solution, but it will require teamwork. Co-equal teams of experimental and computational biologists can construct multiscale differential equation models and test them against experimental data. A successful model provides actionable evidence-based guidance to the entire research and development team. These integrative biology teams may, for historical and cultural reasons, be unsustainable in academia, but they seem naturally suited to modern pharmaceutical research and development. One way to organize such teams and their workflow is described in detail.

Statewide school survey data were used to model the impact of risk and protective factors on self-reported suicide attempts (both AI/AN and non-AI/AN). The cumulative risk and protective model worked similarly for both groups. AI/AN youth had a higher threshold of risk before making a suicide attempt. Protective factors buffered the impact of risk, particularly for the higher risk youth.

AB Although chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is rare, with approximately 5000 new cases in the United States annually, it may be the poster child for the future of oncology. Imatinib mesylate, a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), transformed the course of CML from a rapidly fatal disease (median survival, 3 to 6 years) to a functionally curable, indolent disease with an estimated median survival of more than 25 years. This transformation can be attributed to several key factors: the identification of a causal and actionable molecular aberration-BCR-ABL; the development of a potent and selective Bcr-Abl TKI-imatinib; and, importantly the application of imatinib in the earliest phase of CML. In contrast, imatinib, if used in CML blastic phase, improves median survival to only about 1 year. Similar to CML blastic phase, metastatic solid malignancies have undergone genetic evolution, and their molecular aberrations are complex. As a result, resistance is common and eradication is difficult. The key to the dramatic improvement in the survival of patients with CML involved using imatinib in newly diagnosed disease, before blastic transformation. We hypothesize that metastatic solid tumors are analogous to CML blastic phase, and that to achieve improvements in solid tumor outcomes similar to those seen in CML, application of targeted agents to newly diagnosed disease may be required to prevent disease transformation (i.e., metastases). Targeting driver mutations at the time of diagnosis may be critical to the goal of markedly changing the outlook for patients with cancer.

AB Meaningful anomalies in clinical processes may be related to caring performance or even the patient survival. It is imperative that the anomalies be timely detected such that useful and actionable knowledge of interest could be extracted to clinicians. Many previous approaches assume prior knowledge about the structure of clinical processes, using which anomalies are detected in a supervised manner. For a majority of clinical settings, however, clinical processes are complex, ad hoc, and even unknown a prior. In this paper, we investigate how to facilitate detection of anomalies in an unsupervised manner. An anomaly detection model is presented by applying a density-based clustering method on patient careflow logs. Using the learned model, it is possible to detect whether a particular patient careflow trace is anomalous with respect to normal traces in the logs. The approach has been validated over real data sets collected from a Chinese hospital.

AB Recognizing the anatomical location of actionable findings in radiology reports is an important part of the communication of critical test results between caregivers. One of the difficulties of identifying anatomical locations of actionable findings stems from the fact that anatomical locations are not always stated in a simple, easy to identify manner. Natural language processing techniques are capable of recognizing the relevant anatomical location by processing a diverse set of lexical and syntactic contexts that correspond to the various ways that radiologists represent spatial relations. We report a precision of 86.2%, recall of 85.9%, and F(1)-measure of 86.0 for extracting the anatomical site of an actionable finding. Additionally, we report a precision of 73.8%, recall of 69.8%, and F(1)-measure of 71.8 for extracting an additional anatomical site that grounds underspecified locations. This demonstrates promising results for identifying locations, while error analysis reveals challenges under certain contexts. Future work will focus on incorporating new forms of medical language processing to improve performance and transitioning our method to new types of clinical data.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a practical approach for implementing clinical decision support (CDS) for medication black box warnings (BBWs) into health information systems (HIS).; METHODS: We reviewed all existing medication BBWs and organized them into a taxonomy that identifies opportunities and challenges for implementing CDS for BBWs into HIS.; RESULTS: Of the over 400 BBWs that currently exist, they can be organized into 4 categories with 9 sub-categories based on the types of information contained in the BBWs, who should be notified, and potential actions to that could be taken by the person receiving the BBW. Informatics oriented categories and sub-categories of BBWs include - interactions (13%) (drug-drug (4%) and drug-diagnosis (9%)), testing (21%) (baseline (9%) and on-going (12%)), notifications (29%) (drug prescribers (7%), drug dispensers (2%), drug administrators (9%), patients (10%), and third parties (1%)), and non-actionable (37%). This categorization helps identify BBWs for which CDS can be easily implemented into HIS today (such as drug-drug interaction BBWs), those that cannot be easily implemented into HIS today (such as non-actionable BBWs), and those where advanced and/or integrated HIS need to be in place to implement CDS for BBWs (such a drug dispensers BBWs).; CONCLUSIONS: HIS have the potential to improve patient safety by implementing CDS for BBWs. A key to building CDS for BBWs into HIS is developing a taxonomy to serve as an organizing roadmap for implementation. The informatics oriented BBWs taxonomy presented here identified types of BBWs in which CDS can be implemented easily into HIS currently (a minority of the BBWs) and those types of BBWs where CDS cannot be easily implemented today (a majority of BBWs).

AB BACKGROUND: Small numbers of tests with pending results are documented in hospital discharge summaries leading to breakdown in communication and medical errors due to inadequate followup.; OBJECTIVE: Evaluate effect of using a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system to enforce documentation of tests with pending results into hospital discharge summaries.; METHODS: We assessed the percent of all tests with pending results and those with actionable results that were documented before (n = 182 discharges) and after (n = 203 discharges) implementing the CPOE-enforcement tool. We also surveyed providers (n = 52) about the enforcement functionality.; RESULTS: Documentation of all tests with pending results improved from 12% (87/701 tests) before to 22% (178/812 tests) (p = 0.02) after implementation. Documentation of tests with eventual actionable results increased from 0% (0/24) to 50% (14/28)(p<0.001). Survey respondents felt the intervention improved quality of summaries, provider communication, and was not time-consuming.; CONCLUSIONS: A CPOE tool enforcing documentation of tests with pending results into discharge summaries significantly increased documentation rates, especially of actionable tests. However, gaps in documentation still exist.

AB UNLABELLED: Knowledge of "actionable" somatic genomic alterations present in each tumor (e.g., point mutations, small insertions/deletions, and copy-number alterations that direct therapeutic options) should facilitate individualized approaches to cancer treatment. However, clinical implementation of systematic genomic profiling has rarely been achieved beyond limited numbers of oncogene point mutations. To address this challenge, we utilized a targeted, massively parallel sequencing approach to detect tumor genomic alterations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Nearly 400-fold mean sequence coverage was achieved, and single-nucleotide sequence variants, small insertions/deletions, and chromosomal copynumber alterations were detected simultaneously with high accuracy compared with other methods in clinical use. Putatively actionable genomic alterations, including those that predict sensitivity or resistance to established and experimental therapies, were detected in each tumor sample tested. Thus, targeted deep sequencing of clinical tumor material may enable mutation-driven clinical trials and, ultimately, "personalized" cancer treatment.; SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the rapid proliferation of targeted therapeutic agents, systematic methods to profile clinically relevant tumor genomic alterations remain underdeveloped. We describe a sequencingbased approach to identifying genomic alterations in FFPE tumor samples. These studies affirm the feasibility and clinical utility of targeted sequencing in the oncology arena and provide a foundation for genomics-based stratification of cancer patients.

AB Recent technological advances provide researchers with a way of gathering real-time information on an individual's movement through the use of wearable devices that record acceleration. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying activity types, like walking, standing, and resting, from acceleration data. Our approach decomposes movements into short components called "movelets", and builds a reference for each activity type. Unknown activities are predicted by matching new movelets to the reference. We apply our method to data collected from a single, three-axis accelerometer and focus on activities of interest in studying physical function in elderly populations. An important technical advantage of our methods is that they allow identification of short activities, such as taking two or three steps and then stopping, as well as low frequency rare(compared with the whole time series) activities, such as sitting on a chair. Based on our results we provide simple and actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of large epidemiological studies that could collect accelerometry data for the purpose of predicting the time series of activities and connecting it to health outcomes.

AB Should consumers be able to obtain information about their own bodies, even if it has no proven medical value? Direct-to-consumer ("DTC") genomic companies offer consumers two services: generation of the consumer's personal genetic sequence, and interpretation of that sequence in light of current research. Concerned that consumers will misunderstand genomic information and make ill-advised health decisions, regulators, legislators and scholars have advocated restricted access to DTC genomic services. The Food and Drug Administration, which has historically refrained from regulating most genetic tests, has announced its intent to treat DTC genomic services as medical devices because they make "medical claims." This Article argues that FDA regulation of genomic services as medical devices would be counterproductive. Clinical laboratories conducting genetic tests are already overseen by a federal regime administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. While consumers and clinicians would benefit from clearer communication of test results and their health implications, FDA's gatekeeping framework is ill-suited to weigh the safety and efficacy of genomic information that is not medically actionable in traditional ways. Playing gatekeeper would burden FDA's resources, conflict with the patient-empowering policies promoted by personalized medicine initiatives, impair individuals' access to information in which they have powerful autonomy interests, weaken novel participatory research infrastructures, and set a poor precedent for the future regulation of medical information. Rather than applying its risk-based regulatory framework to genetic information, FDA should ameliorate regulatory uncertainty by working with the Federal Trade Commission and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure that DTC genomic services deliver analytically valid data, market and implement their services in a truthful manner, and fully disclose the limitations of their services. Federal agencies with relevant expertise should collaborate on standards and best practices for interpreting genetic information in light of scientific uncertainty, and an adverse event reporting system should be established to collect empirical data verifying or disproving the speculative harms resulting from individual access to genetic information. Most of all, FDA should take advantage of this opportunity to adapt its regulatory process to an increasingly informational health ecosystem.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to determine the genotype frequencies for cytochrome p450 enzyme 2C19 variant alleles both in the US pan-ethnic population and various US ethnic groups and to establish the frequency of clinically actionable genotypes.; METHODS: Analytical results were obtained from 1,396 consecutive samples submitted for cytochrome p450 enzyme 2C19 genotyping tests and stored in a proprietary database. This database was queried and genotypes and predicted phenotypes established. Anonymized samples were obtained from specimens submitted for cystic fibrosis genotyping that contained ethnicity information. Samples from 357, 149, and 346 individuals self-identified as white, African American, and Hispanic, respectively, were analyzed. In addition, 342 anonymized samples submitted for Ashkenazi Jewish panel testing were analyzed.; RESULTS: Significant ethnic differences were observed in the frequencies of the *17 ultrarapid allele among the various groups studied. In the pan-ethnic population, 3.8% of tested patients were classified as ultrarapid metabolizers, 24% as extensive metabolizers heterozygous for a *17 ultrarapid allele, 27% as intermediate metabolizers, and 3.5% as poor metabolizers. Using stringent criteria, 7.3% of individuals would have clinically actionable genotypes. In addition, we detected two individuals with a haplotype of *2/*17 and a single individual with a haplotype of *4/*17 indicating that the *17 hypermetabolic allele can occur on a *1, *2, or *4 background.

AB Prior research developed Reassortment Networks to reconstruct the evolution of segmented viruses under both reassortment and mutation. We report their application to the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus (S-OIV). A database of all influenza A viruses, for which complete genome sequences were available in Genbank by October 2009, was created and dynamic programming was used to compute distances between all corresponding segments. A reassortment network was created to obtain the minimum cost evolutionary paths from all viruses to the exemplar S-OIV A/California/04/2009. This analysis took 35 hours on the Cray Extreme Multithreading (XMT) supercomputer, which has special hardware to permit efficient parallelization. Six specific H1N1/H1N2 bottleneck viruses were identified that almost always lie on minimum cost paths to S-OIV. We conjecture that these viruses are crucial to S-OIV evolution and worthy of careful study from a molecular biology viewpoint. In phylogenetics, ancestors are typically medians that have no functional constraints. In our method, ancestors are not inferred, but rather chosen from previously observed viruses along a path of mutation and reassortment leading to the target virus. This specificity and functional constraint render our results actionable for further experiments in vitro and in vivo.

AB BACKGROUND: With the adoption of electronic medical records by medical group practices, there are opportunities to improve the quality of care for patients discharged from hospitals. However, there is little guidance for medical groups outside integrated hospital systems to automate the flow of patient information during transitions in care.; OBJECTIVE: To describe the technological resources, expertise and time needed to develop an automated system providing information to ambulatory physicians when their patients are discharged from hospitals to home.; DEVELOPMENT: Within a medical group practice, we developed an automated alert system that provides notification of discharges, reminders of the need for follow-up visits, drugs added during inpatient stays, and recommendations for laboratory monitoring of high-risk drugs. We tracked components of the information system required and the time spent by team members. We used USA national averages of hourly wages to estimate personnel costs.; APPLICATION: Critical components of the information system are notifications of hospital discharges through an admission, discharge and transfer registration (ADT) interface, linkage to the group's scheduling system, access to information on pharmacy dispensing and lab tests, and an interface engine. Total personnel cost was $76,314. Nearly half (47%) was for 614 hours by physicians who developed content, provided overall project management, and reviewed alerts to ensure that only 'actionable' alerts would be sent.; CONCLUSION: Implementing a system to provide information about hospital discharges requires strong internal informatics expertise, cooperation between facilities and ambulatory providers, development of electronic linkages, and extensive commitment of physician time.

AB We describe the development of an audit and feedback intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using a theoretical framework. Participants included attending physicians, neonatal fellows, pediatric residents, and nurse practitioners. The intervention was based on the "model of actionable feedback" which emphasizes that feedback should be timely, individualized, nonpunitive, and customized to be effective. We found that real-time feedback could not be provided for the parameters established in this study, as we had to collect and analyze numerous data elements to assess appropriate initiation and continuation of antibiotics and required longer intervals to examine trends in antibiotic use. We learned during focus groups that NICU clinicians strongly resisted assigning individual responsibility for antibiotic prescribing as they viewed this as a shared responsibility informed by each patient's laboratory data and clinical course. We were able to create a non-punitive atmosphere thanks to written informed consent from NICU attendings and assurance from leadership that prescribing practices would not be used to assess job performance. We provided customized, meaningful feedback integrating input from the participants. Adapting the principles of the "model of actionable feedback" to provide feedback for antimicrobial prescribing practices proved challenging in the NICU setting.

AB INTRODUCTION: An article with a clear message can transfer research knowledge better. However, this is the case when the message suits the type of study methodology (research design) and its results. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of message articles and the type of study methodologies.; METHODS: Articles published between 2001 and 2006, on maternal care, diabetes, and tuberculosis, which were based on studies performed on the Iranian population were investigated. A systematic search was performed in foreign databases 'Pubmed, Medline, and Embase', and national databases 'Iranmedex, SID (Scientific Information Database), and Iranpsych'. Seven hundred and ninety-five articles were examined for the type of study methodology and presence of an actionable message (one that specifies what and how an action should be carried out).; RESULTS: Among the 795 articles accessed, cross-sectional studies were the most frequent (50.9%) and systematic reviews were the least frequent (0.4%). Cohort cases were observed in 6.9% of the cases. Actionable messages were observed in 22.1% of all the cases and 24.7% of the cross-sectional studies.; CONCLUSIONS: Cohort studies increased from 5% in 2001 to 6.9% in 2006, but the shortage of systematic reviews represented a major weakness in the country's knowledge production process. Studies with a higher level of evidence such as systematic reviews, and cohort and interventional studies should be among the priorities of knowledge production in the country.

AB Tobacco-free campuses are a great public health initiative. Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Campus 2020 address tobacco use and young adults including college students. Sources indicate that of the more than 6,000 colleges and universities in the United States, less than 800 are either smoke free or tobacco free. An increasing number of college campus policy makers in the United States are implementing smoke-free or tobacco-free policies, including procedures for violators of these policies. However, without a clearly defined and actionable enforcement component, these policies serve little purpose. This has become a policy enforcement issue that campus leaders should address. Should colleges and universities become tobacco free, if enforcement is not implemented? College and university administrators should demonstrate leadership by having violators of tobacco-free campus policies held to the same standard as those who violate other policies.

AB Comparative effectiveness research fundamentally reorients how clinical evidence is generated and used with the goal of providing actionable information to decision-makers. To achieve this, it is vital that decision-makers and the research enterprise are engaged from research inception, to evidence generation and translation. Practice-based research networks are affiliated clinicians in diverse communities with the goal of conducting research to improve care. Practice-based research networks have the potential to advance all phases of the comparative effectiveness research cycle. The aim of this paper is to explore current and potential roles of practice-based research networks in conducting comparative effectiveness research.

AB Health information and the channels that facilitate the flow and exchange of this information to and among health care providers are key elements of a strong health system that offers high-quality services,yet few studies have examined how health care workers define, obtain, and apply information in the course of their daily work. To better understand health information needs and barriers across all of levels of the health care system, the authors conducted a needs assessment in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data collection consisted of 46 key informant interviews and 9 focus group discussions. Results of the needs assessment pointed to the following themes: (a) perceptions or definitions of health information related to daily tasks performed at different levels of the health system; (b) information flow in the public health structure; (c) need for practical information; and (d) criteria for usability of information. This needs assessment found that health information needs vary across the health system in Uttar Pradesh. Information needs are dynamic and encompass programmatic and service delivery information. Providing actionable information across all levels is a key means to strengthen the health system and improve the quality of services. An adequate assessment of health information needs, including opportunities, barriers, and gaps, is a prerequisite to designing effective communication of actionable information.

AB The need for speed and efficiency in life insurance underwriting has never been greater. With increasing acquisition costs, the need for timeliness to complete the sales process, and the need for accurate mortality prediction a great deal of resources have been devoted to the development of non-traditional underwriting processes and criteria in hopes of streamlining the process. In this paper, we describe an exploratory analysis of mortality linked data from the US NHANES III study. Our goal for this analysis was to identify mortality predictors that would be good candidates for further investigation in insurance applicants, especially in the context of simplified issue products which focus on younger age applicants. We identified aerobic exercise, dental health, alcohol beverage type and quantity, and dietary components and patterns as factors that may hold promise as mortality predictors in persons age 17-65. Though the limitations of this analysis preclude the immediate use of these factors as underwriting criteria, it does appear that several of these hold promise, and should be tested in an insurance application context. Focus groups, market testing, or even insertion as non-actionable questions in a subset of applications may be ways to collect further data on them.

AB It is inevitable that neonatal genetic information will be communicated to parents and a potential for psychiatric injury exists where the communication is negligent. An important question in this regard is whether a health-care provider may owe a duty of care to parents when communicating accurate genetic information, or whether the courts might treat it as merely the receipt of distressing news, which hitherto attracts no liability in English Tort Law. The important role of genetic counselling in this context will likely be determinative in deciding whether communicating accurate genetic information is actionable because it arguably distinguishes the parent-physician relationship from that of messenger-recipient. If communication is accepted as being something more than the receipt of distressing news and is capable of causing 'shock', then parents will need to establish themselves as either primary or secondary victims if claims are to be reconciled with the Alcock paradigm. Claims by parents as secondary victims will be unlikely to succeed because the neonate does not fulfil the role of primary victim, although parents may be owed a duty as elevated primary victims as a result of the lack of an immediate victim. Elevating claimants to primary victim status is not without criticism and may serve to further complicate a difficult area of tort law. Alternatively, it may be open to parents to demonstrate that a duty exists subsequent to an assumption of responsibility, as the provision of genetic counselling during and after neonatal screening is indicative of health-care providers assuming responsibility for the parents' mental health. If parents are able to establish that a duty of care exists, then success of their claims will be determined by reference to breach and causation. The potential difficulties and solutions, particularly with regard to causation, are also briefly considered. It is suggested that breach will likely be determined by reference to a responsible body of medical opinion, while it is proposed that the courts adopt a material increase analysis when assessing causation.

AB BACKGROUND: Feedback on the wards is an important component of medical student education. Medical schools have incorporated formalized feedback mechanisms such as clinical encounter cards and standardized patient encounters into clinical curricula. However, the system could be further improved as medical students frequently feel uncomfortable requesting feedback, and are often dissatisfied with the quality of the feedback they receive.; AIMS: This article explores the shortcomings of the existing medical student feedback system and examines the relevant literature in an effort to shed light on areas in which the system can be enhanced. The discussion focuses on resident-provided feedback but is broadly applicable to delivering feedback in general.; METHODS: A review of the organizational psychology and business administration literature on fostering effective feedback was performed. These insights were then applied to the setting of medical education.; RESULTS: Providing effective feedback requires training and forethought. Feedback itself should be specific and actionable.; CONCLUSION: Utilizing these strategies will help medical students and educators get the most out of existing feedback systems.

AB Clinical intelligence (CI) is an emerging field in health care arising from the proliferation of electronic data being generated through the increasing use of healthcare information technology (HIT). It is defined as the electronic aggregation of accurate, relevant and timely data into meaningful information and actionable knowledge in order to achieve optimal healthcare structures, processes and outcomes. Clinical intelligence will dramatically change the discipline of nursing informatics in the future. This presentation describes the role of nurse informaticists (NI) today in building clinical intelligence, including communicating the vision, designing systems, educating clinicians, preparing themselves, and supporting research.

AB This article presents the findings of a collaborative effort between the Georgetown University Student Consulting Team and Booz Allen Hamilton to interview healthcare providers undergoing the transition to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS). The goals of this study were to extract a common set of trends, challenges, and lessons learned surrounding the implementation of the ICD-10-CM/PCS code set and to produce actionable information that might serve as a resource for organizations navigating the transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS. The selected survey sample focused on a subset of large hospitals, integrated health systems, and other national industry leaders who are likely to have initiated the implementation process far in advance of the October 2013 deadline. Guided by a uniform survey tool, the team conducted a series of one-on-one provider interviews with department heads, senior staff members, and project managers leading ICD-10-CM/PCS conversion efforts from six diverse health systems. As expected, the integrated health systems surveyed seem to be on or ahead of schedule for the ICD-10-CM/PCS coding transition. However, results show that as of April 2010 most providers were still in the planning stages of implementation and were working to raise awareness within their organizations. Although individual levels of preparation varied widely among respondents, the study identified several trends, challenges, and lessons learned that will enable healthcare providers to assess their own status with respect to the industry and will provide useful insight into best practices for the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition.

AB The remarkably heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has become more apparent over the last decade. In general, advanced lung cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. The discovery of multiple molecular mechanisms underlying the development, progression, and prognosis of lung cancer, however, has created new opportunities for targeted therapy and improved outcome. In this paper, we define "molecular subtypes" of lung cancer based on specific actionable genetic aberrations. Each subtype is associated with molecular tests that define the subtype and drugs that may potentially treat it. We hope this paper will be a useful guide to clinicians and researchers alike by assisting in therapy decision making and acting as a platform for further study. In this new era of cancer treatment, the 'one-size-fits-all' paradigm is being forcibly pushed aside-allowing for more effective, personalized oncologic care to emerge.

OMH incorporated a tracer methodology to assess services; a licensing instrument that reflected OMH goals; and a systematic piloting, feedback, and implementation process. Clinic staff reported that the new procedures facilitated communication between OMH and clinics, accurately identified clinics' successes, and provided actionable and programmatic feedback. This initiative represents the first step by a state mental health authority to create a system of accountability that is clinically relevant and supported by stakeholders.

AB AIMS: This study explores attitudes, motivations and self-reported impact in connection with direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic testing amongst a group of life scientists in Switzerland.; METHODS: Data were collected through: (1) a self-completion online questionnaire, and (2) semi-structured qualitative interviews. Forty participants completed the questionnaire and 10 were interviewed.; RESULTS: Curiosity was mentioned as the primary reason for undergoing testing, while less significance was attributed to receiving actionable health information. The opportunity to contribute to research ranked high as a motive for testing. Overall, participants assessed their experience with the test as positive and were willing to recommend it to others. Some reported that the testing had an impact on how they view their health, but only a third of participants planned on showing the results to health practitioners. Participants consistently referred to 'fun' when describing several aspects of the testing experience. The 'fun factor' manifested itself in different phases of the process, including the motivation for taking the test, receiving the information and putting the test results to use (including sharing and discussing it with others). This finding suggests the need to further explore the concept of personal utility in DTC genomics.; CONCLUSIONS: Although this group is not representative of the broader population due to both their scientific expertise and their willingness to try out a controversial new technology, their experiences provide valuable insights into the role of personal curiosity and altruism (fostering medical research) as motivations for testing and the utility attributed to both.

AB Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) place a heavy burden on developing countries, whose relatively recent adoption of Western-style health behaviors and lifestyle choices has led to increased prevalence of risk factors for NCDs over the past decade. NCDs are compounding the burden of infectious disease on health systems in those countries. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched several risk reduction initiatives. WHO is drafting a monitoring framework and voluntary targets as the basis for a consultation process with member states. However, the indicators and targets that a global consultation process will produce will inevitably provide high-level, aggregated information, such as progress toward reducing premature NCD mortality. Regional and national decisionmakers and planners, on the other hand, will need more proximal and granular information to track progress toward high-level goals and will be constrained by the resources and demands in their respective jurisdictions. The relative importance of different risk factors and manifest NCDs differs across countries, and so do health systems' capabilities and resources. Thus, national and regional decisionmakers will need: (1) a comprehensive set of indicators to guide on-the-ground prioritization decisions and track progress toward high-level targets and (2) actionable data to predict the impact of changes in proximal indicators on high-level targets. As a first step, this article outlines a roadmap toward a comprehensive system for national and regional decisionmakers to (1) track progress toward the key WHO goal of reducing NCD mortality by 25 percent by 2025 and (2) prioritize resources and interventions to achieve that goal.

AB To evaluate the possible impact that the BP Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill might have had on pollution levels in the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) analyzed surface water and ambient air quality pollutant data taken from MDEQ and EPA monitoring sites on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The data were compared with acute, chronic, and human health air and water quality standards to determine whether the pollutant levels occurring during the oil spill could cause ecological and/or human health effects. The water quality data indicated levels of nickel, vanadium, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and semivolatile organic compounds analyzed remained below acute and chronic levels for both aquatic life and human health. The air quality sampling data showed that the levels of VOCs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with the oil spill were well below EPA chronic and human health screening levels. A comparison of the air quality monitoring data taken before and after the oil spill showed that the concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter were elevated for brief periods but remained below actionable levels.

AB There has been growing emphasis on quality measures and process analysis techniques that may be implemented in the daily practice of radiation oncology to improve the overall quality of patient care. In this work, quality measures are a form of monitoring that should be actionable and specific to guide process improvement efforts. They are most effective when used to determine the level of execution proficiency against a standard. Control charts are an effective way to separate a change in the process from process noise such that the user can focus on issues that are more likely to improve quality. The field of radiotherapy would benefit from a common dashboard of quality measures for the different processes in radiation oncology clinics, and some suggestions are provided. The dashboard would be used to provide continuous feedback on a clinic's capability to maintain or exceed standards. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Whole-genome analysis and whole-exome analysis generate many more clinically actionable findings than traditional targeted genetic analysis. These findings may be relevant to research participants themselves as well as for members of their families. Though researchers performing genomic analyses are likely to find medically significant genetic variations for nearly every research participant, what they will find for any given participant is unpredictable. The ubiquity and diversity of these findings complicate questions about disclosing individual genetic test results. We outline an approach for disclosing a select range of genetic results to the relatives of research participants who have died, developed in response to relatives' requests during a pilot study of large-scale medical genetic sequencing. We also argue that studies that disclose individual research results to participants should, at a minimum, passively disclose individual results to deceased participants' relatives.

AB Analysis of media reporting on the H1N1 vaccine during the 2009 pandemic reveals a dissonance between the nature and content of the reporting, the government's messages, and the public's perceptions of vaccine safety and desirability. Despite careful attention to history and especially the lessons offered by Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg in their study of the 1976 "Epidemic that Never Was," government officials failed to escape criticism for decisions made and actions taken in the midst of the unfolding contagion threat. Moreover, public opinion polls show that substantial portions of the population failed to hear, believe, or heed the government's messages. Looking at the enduring narrative of the government's vaccine efforts through the lens of newspaper reports exposes six points of distortion. These points - the pervasive uncertainty inherent in a novel contagion; advances in information technology and electronic communications; the new news environment; the political polarization of American society; the infrastructure of the American public health system; and the oddities of public health emergency and vaccination injury compensation laws - interfered with the public's reception of the government's message and infected the public's perception of government veracity and leadership capability. They challenge us to consider whether current planning is sufficient to prepare Americans to respond effectively to a lives-threatening national crisis. If we are to ensure that the public receives and recognizes accurate and actionable information essential for the prevention or containment of a deadly contagion, we will need to understand and address the impact of these distorting forces. © 2012 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc.

AB Documenting a patient's anesthetic in the medical record is quite different from summarizing an office visit, writing a surgical procedure note, or recording other clinical encounters. Some of the biggest differences are the frequent sampling of physiologic data, volume of data, and diversity of data collected. The goal of the anesthesia record is to accurately and comprehensively capture a patient's anesthetic experience in a succinct format. Having ready access to physiologic trends is essential to allowing anesthesiologists to make proper diagnoses and treatment decisions. Although the value provided by anesthesia information management systems and their functions may be different than other electronic health records, the real benefits of an anesthesia information management system depend on having it fully integrated with the other health information technologies. An anesthesia information management system is built around the electronic anesthesia record and incorporates anesthesia-relevant data pulled from disparate systems such as laboratory, billing, imaging, communication, pharmacy, and scheduling. The ability of an anesthesia information management system to collect data automatically enables anesthesiologists to reliably create an accurate record at all times, regardless of other concurrent demands. These systems also have the potential to convert large volumes of data into actionable information for outcomes research and quality-improvement initiatives. Developing a system to validate the data is crucial in conducting outcomes research using large datasets. Technology innovations outside of healthcare, such as multitouch interfaces, near-instant software response times, powerful but simple search capabilities, and intuitive designs, have raised the bar for users' expectations of health information technology. © 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

AB Citizens are increasingly called upon to comment on issues that directly concern them. However, such consultations may be tokenistic [1] as they occur with limited respondents, or may be at a time, or in a format which is inconvenient to the user. To encourage wider participation, the VoiceYourView project (vYv) has developed a system allowing people to make comments in a manner, time and place convenient to them. A real world trial of the prototype system was conducted at Coventry University campus to explore issues related to the system's usability and usage, as a means of enabling campus users to comment on their environment. Members of the university population were invited to comment on the university estate using one of five technologies (e-mail, online form, iPhone app, SMS message, or electronic kiosk). Although the immediate application area in this case was the design of public spaces, the approach can be transferred to other domains and thus provide a new way of gathering user information. Submitted comments were automatically analysed in terms of theme, sentiment, location and actionability and displayed online in a 2D visualisation. It is argued that that online data collection (crowd sourcing and skimming social networks) may provide a rich source of information for future ergonomists.

AB BACKGROUND: Nigeria continues to have high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality. This is partly associated with lack of adequate obstetric care, partly with high risks in pregnancy, including heavy work. We examined actionable risk factors and underlying determinants at community level in Bauchi and Cross River States of Nigeria, including several related to male responsibility in pregnancy.; METHOD: In 2009, field teams visited a stratified (urban/rural) last stage random sample of 180 enumeration areas drawn from the most recent censuses in each of Bauchi and Cross River states. A structured questionnaire administered in face-to-face interviews with women aged 15-49 years documented education, income, recent birth history, knowledge and attitudes related to safe birth, and deliveries in the last three years. Closed questions covered female genital mutilation, intimate partner violence (IPV) in the last year, IPV during the last pregnancy, work during the last pregnancy, and support during pregnancy. The outcome was complications in pregnancy and delivery (eclampsia, sepsis, bleeding) among survivors of childbirth in the last three years. We adjusted bivariate and multivariate analysis for clustering.; FINDINGS: The most consistent and prominent of 28 candidate risk factors and underlying determinants for non-fatal maternal morbidity was intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy (ORa 2.15, 95%CIca 1.43-3.24 in Bauchi and ORa 1.5, 95%CI 1.20-2.03 in Cross River). Other spouse-related factors in the multivariate model included not discussing pregnancy with the spouse and, independently, IPV in the last year. Shortage of food in the last week was a factor in both Bauchi (ORa 1.66, 95%CIca 1.22-2.26) and Cross River (ORa 1.32, 95%CIca 1.15-1.53). Female genital mutilation was a factor among less well to do Bauchi women (ORa 2.1, 95%CIca 1.39-3.17) and all Cross River women (ORa 1.23, 95%CIca 1.1-1.5).; INTERPRETATION: Enhancing clinical protocols and skills can only benefit women in Nigeria and elsewhere. But the violence women experience throughout their lives--genital mutilation, domestic violence, and steep power gradients--is accentuated through pregnancy and childbirth, when women are most vulnerable. IPV especially in pregnancy, women's fear of husbands or partners and not discussing pregnancy are all within men's capacity to change.

AB BACKGROUND: Community participation was a core tenet of Primary Health Care as articulated in the 1970s. How this could be generated and maintained was less clear. This historical article describes development of protocols for evidence-based community mobilisation in five local administrative units (municipios) in the Mexican state of Guerrero between 1992 and 1995.; METHODS: A sample of five to eight sentinel sites represented each of the most impoverished municipalities of the poorest five of the state's seven regions. A 1992 baseline survey of diarrhoea and its actionable determinants provided the substrate for discussion with local planners and communities. Municipal planners used different strategies to promote participation. In one municipality, new health committees took control of water quality. In another, municipal authorities hired health promoters; a song promoted oral rehydration, and house-to-house interpersonal discussions promoted chlorination. In the poorest and most mountainous municipality, radio casera (home-made radio) soap operas used local "stars". In the largest and most disparate municipality, a child-to-family scheme relied on primary and secondary school teachers. The research team assessed outcomes at intervals and used the results to reinforce local planning and action.; RESULTS: Diarrhoea rates declined in all five municipalities, and there were several positive intermediate outcomes from the communication strategies - changing knowledge, household practices and uptake of services. There was a strong link between specific contents of the communication package and the changing knowledge or practices.; CONCLUSIONS: Apart from these evidence-based interventions, other factors probably contributed to the decline of childhood diarrhoea. But, by monitoring implementation of planning decisions and the impact this has at community level, micro-regional planning can stimulate and reinforce actions likely to improve the health of communities. The process empowered municipalities to get access to more resources from the state government and international agencies.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence that clinical preventive services (CPS) reduce morbidity and mortality, CPS performance has not improved in adult primary care. In addition to implementing electronic health records (EHRs), key factors for improving CPS include providing actionable information at the point of care, technical support staff, and quality-improvement assistance. These resources are not typically available in small practices.; PURPOSE: Estimate the impact on CPS delivery after a software upgrade to embed a clinical decision support system and practice-level quality-improvement support services.; METHODS: Practices were recruited from the Primary Care Information Project, a citywide initiative assisting practices adopt health information technology. Data were collected in 2009 and 2010, and analyses were conducted in 2010 and 2011. Across two time periods, receipt of CPS was calculated for 56 practices. Period 1 measured CPS delivery 2-37 months following implementation of an EHR. Period 2 measured CPS delivery within the first 6 months after an EHR software upgrade.; RESULTS: Substantial increases in the delivery of selected CPS were observed after the EHR software upgrades. Blood pressure control for patients with hypertension increased from 46.0% to 54.8%. Breast cancer screening, recorded BMI, and HbA1c testing for patients with diabetes also increased. More than half of the practices increased their patients' blood pressure control, recorded BMI, breast cancer screening, and HbA1c screening by ≥5 percentage points.; CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of CPS can increase in small primary care practices that implement an EHR that includes comprehensive quality-improvement support.

AB OBJECTIVES: Parents need meaningful and actionable information if they are to reduce household environmental health risks to their children. To address this issue, we tested the effectiveness of a multi-risk social/cognitive intervention on rural low-income parents' (1) environmental health self-efficacy and (2) stage of environmental health precautionary adoption.; METHODS: Biomarker (lead, cotinine) and household samples (carbon monoxide, radon, mold/mildew, and drinking water contaminants) were collected from 235 families (399 adults, 441 children) in Montana and Washington states. Families were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups; intervention families received 4 visits from public health nurses who provided tailored information and guidance to parents; controls received usual and customary public health services.; RESULTS: At 3 months, the intervention group had significantly higher scores on (1) all 6 risk-specific self-efficacy subscales (P < .01), (2) general environmental health self-efficacy (P < .001), (3) 5 of 6 risk-specific precaution adoption subscales (P < .05), and (4) general environmental health precaution adoption (P < .001).; CONCLUSIONS: The intervention yielded significant improvements in both outcomes. This evidence supported the need for a policy discussion addressing the added value that broadbased public health nurse interventions might bring to children's environmental health.

AB Comparative-effectiveness research (CER) aims to produce actionable evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of medical products and interventions as they are used outside of controlled research settings. Although CER evidence regarding medications is particularly needed shortly after market approval, key methodological challenges include (i) potential bias due to channeling of patients to the newly marketed medication because of various patient-, physician-, and system-related factors; (ii) rapid changes in the characteristics of the user population during the early phase of marketing; and (iii) lack of timely data and the often small number of users in the first few months of marketing. We propose a mix of approaches to generate comparative-effectiveness data in the early marketing period, including sequential cohort monitoring with secondary health-care data and propensity score (PS) balancing, as well as extended follow-up of phase III and phase IV trials, indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials, and modeling and simulation of virtual trials.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to perform a prospective assessment of the impact of a CAD system in a screen-film mammography screening program during a period of 3 years.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study was carried out on a population of 21,855 asymptomatic women (45-65 years). Mammograms were processed in a CAD system and independently interpreted by one of six radiologists. We analyzed the following parameters: sensitivity of radiologist's interpretation (without and with CAD), detection increase, recall rate and positive predictive value of biopsy, CAD's marks, radiologist's false negatives and comparative analysis of carcinomas detected and non-detected by CAD.; RESULTS: Detection rate was 4.3. CAD supposed an increase of 0.1 in detection rate and 1% in the total number of cases (p<0.005). The impact on recall rate was not significant (0.4%) and PPV of percutaneous biopsy was unchanged by CAD (20.23%). CAD's marks were 2.7 per case and 0.7 per view. Radiologist's false negatives were 13 lesions which were initially considered as CAD's false positives.; CONCLUSIONS: CAD supposed a significant increase in detection, without modifications in recall rates and PPV of biopsy. However, better results could have been achieved if radiologists had considered actionable those cases marked by CAD but initially misinterpreted. Copyright © 2010. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: It is well established that clinical inertia generates suboptimal care in patients with chronic diseases, and policies and interventions have yet to satisfactorily address the problem.; METHODS: This paper integrates the relevant literatures on clinical inertia and Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT) from psychology to identify an actionable explanatory mechanism.; RESULTS: We review RFT and show that it provides a mechanism that may explain key provider contributions to clinical inertia. We then identify two general intervention strategies based on RFT: one that changes individual sensitivity to positive/negative outcomes and another that maintains the sensitivity to positive/negative outcome but frames how information is provided to match the sensitivity.; CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RFT is a plausible explanation to guide the development of policies and interventions for mitigating clinical inertia. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Busulfan pharmacokinetic (PK) monitoring of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is necessary to minimize adverse events associated with both under- and over-dosing of busulfan during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Three strategies are frequently used to calculate the AUC including in-house polynomial methods, the trapezoidal method (also called noncompartmental analysis), and the single compartment model with first-order elimination method. We compared these 3 methods, their clinical performance, and the relationship of AUC variance to analytical variance when each of these methods is used.; METHODS: Clinical busulfan PK data was reviewed from 159 patients receiving the first dose of oral busulfan while undergoing HSCT. These data were used as templates to simulate AUC results and actions with varying amounts of analytical precision.; RESULTS: Based on a predefined goal therapeutic target, the method for calculating AUC significantly changed the number of recommended busulfan dose adjustments (p<0.000001). Overall, the number of dose adjustments would be expected to drop by approximately 10% due to calibration optimization of the busulfan concentration measurement method.; CONCLUSION: Analytical variance and the AUC calculation method play a considerable role in the clinical management of busulfan dosing during HSCT. With better understanding and optimization of the analytical method, the reliability of clinically actionable information from busulfan PK can increase. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB There has been an explosion of technology-enabled scientific insight into the basic biology of the causes of adverse events. This has been driven, in part, by the development of the various "omics" tools (e.g., genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) and associated bioinformatics platforms. Meanwhile, for decades, changes in preclinical testing protocols and guidelines have been limited. Preclinical safety testing currently relies heavily on the use of outdated animal models. Application of systems biology methods to evaluation of toxicities in oncology treatments can accelerate the introduction of safe, effective drugs. Systems biology adds insights regarding the causes and mechanisms of adverse effects, provides important and actionable information to help understand the risks and benefits to humans, focuses testing on methods that add value to the safety testing process, and leads to modifications of chemical entities to reduce liabilities during development. Leveraging emerging technologies, such as genomics and proteomics, may make preclinical safety testing more efficient and accurate and lead to better safety decisions. The development of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance document on the use of systems biology in clinical testing would greatly benefit the development of drugs for oncology by communicating the potential application of specific methodologies, providing a framework for qualification and application of systems biology outcomes, and providing insight into the challenges and limitations of systems biology in the regulatory decision-making process. ©2011 AACR

Early detection and expedited implementation of sepsis treatment bundles that include early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) for patients with severe sepsis were implemented.; METHODS: In a top-down, bottom-up approach to performance improvement, teams at 21 medical centers independently decided how to implement treatment bundles, using a "playbook" developed by rapid cycle pilot testing at two sites and endorsed by a sepsis steering committee of regional and medical center clinical leaders. The playbook contained treatment algorithms, standardized order sets and flow charts, best practice alerts, and chart abstraction tools. Regional mentors and improvement advisers within the medical centers supported team-building and rapid implementation. Timely and actionable data allowed ongoing identification of improvement opportunities. A consistent approach to performance improvement propelled local rapid improvement cycles and joint problem solving across facilities.; RESULTS: The number of sepsis diagnoses per 1,000 admissions increased from a baseline value of 35.7 in July 2009 to 119.4 in May 2011. The percent of admitted patients who have blood cultures drawn who also have a serum lactate level drawn increased from a baseline of 27% to 97% in May 2011. The percent of patients receiving EGDT who had a second and lower lactate level within six hours increased from 52% at baseline to 92% in May 2011.; CONCLUSION: Twenty-one cross-functional frontline teams redesigned processes of care to provide regionally standardized, evidence-based treatment algorithms for sepsis, substantially increasing the identification and risk stratification of patients with suspected sepsis and the provision of a sepsis care bundle that included EGDT.

AB Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) values is an accepted requirement for patients with diabetes using multiple daily injections of insulin. Nevertheless, for many patients, the full value of SMBG has yet to be realized due to a number of factors that contribute to patients not taking appropriate action based on the achieved result. The reasons for this are complex but are related to the burden imposed by performing the tests, the need for complex numerical calculations, and the demand for undertaking this activity multiple times each day. In the near future, SMBG devices are likely to include technological innovations that are aimed at overcoming these barriers, offering "actionable" SMBG for patients using insulin. These innovations should include technologies that will allow customization and individualization based upon specific therapy regimens. © 2011 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent quality initiatives require that the routine annual therapeutic drug-monitoring (TDM) parameters for the high-risk medication digoxin include a measure of renal function and a serum potassium level but not a serum digoxin concentration (SDC) measurement. Several studies have shown that the majority of the SDCs obtained in hospital settings provide little clinically actionable information.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the appropriateness and utility of SDCs ordered in a medical group practice setting by categorizing the reason the SDC was ordered and identifying action taken in response to the result.; METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted as a retrospective, electronic medical record (EMR) review of 90 primary care patients with continuous prescriptions for digoxin current on their medication profile with no gaps in therapy for at least 2 years prior to an SDC result entered into the EMR between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2009. The reason the SDC was ordered was abstracted independently by 2 reviewers, who then assigned it to 1 of 8 predefined indication categories based on previously published criteria and practice guidelines. A third reviewer resolved inter-reviewer discrepancy (n = 1).; RESULTS: A total of 90 patients with at least 1 SDC met inclusion criteria. Routine monitoring was the most frequent SDC order indication category with 35 patients (38.9%), 17 (48.6%) of whom did not have the recommended monitoring measures of potassium or renal function drawn concurrently. Patients were included in other categories as follows: confirmation of signs/symptoms of toxicity 30 (33.3%); assessment of factors altering pharmacokinetics 5 (5.6%); assessment of dosage change 5 (5.6%); assessment of drug interaction 3 (3.3%); assessment of clinical response 3 (3.3%); assessment of adherence 1 (1.1%); and other 2 (2.2%). Across all categories, a total of 19 (21.1%) of SDC results were outside the therapeutic range of 0.5 nanograms (ng) per mL and 2.0 ng per mL, 18 of which were below 0.5 ng per mL, with none of the subtherapeutic levels leading to a change in digoxin therapy. Only 1 patient (1.1%) had therapy changed in response to an elevated abnormal SDC result of 2.1 ng per mL and was in the routine monitoring category.; CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SDC results obtained in our medical group setting did not lead to clinical action, such as dose adjustment or drug discontinuation. SDCs were commonly measured as part of routine monitoring, which is considered an inappropriate indication, and often without being accompanied by better markers for digoxin toxicity such as serum potassium levels and measures of renal function as recommended by drug-monitoring quality initiatives. Provider education is needed regarding the most indicative digoxin TDM parameters to obtain in order to satisfy quality initiatives.

AB AIM: This study illustrates how King's theory of goal attainment was used to focus an examination of whole-person care (WPC) and to extend the range of knowledge needed for WPC and nursing practice.; BACKGROUND: Leadership implemented a faith-based innovation using continuing education for patient care that incorporates body-mind-spirit and eight principles called CREATION. Three questions arose: (1) Is there an evidence-based framework to determine whether the philosophy supports the discipline of nursing? (2) How extensive is the adoption and application of WPC? (3) Does the model make a difference in the context of nurse-patient interactions and outcomes in support of Magnet recognition criteria?; METHODS: Interpretative phenomenology was used and an interview protocol was developed to examine the adoption and movement toward a culture of WPC.; RESULTS: WPC was 'lived.' it is a relationship-oriented patient care model. However, except in direct patient care, the principles of creation were poorly diffused.; IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: These results contribute to nursing leadership's roles in fostering a workplace climate that enables the diffusion of innovative models of care. In addition, these results support the Institute of Medicine's call for nurses to take the lead in adopting innovations and provides leaders with actionable strategies. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB The current study aimed to evaluate the locally directed radon roll-out program that was conducted between 2001 and 2005 in England and Wales to increase radon awareness and testing rates. A representative sample of 1,578 residents aged 16 and older were interviewed who lived in radon-affected areas of 15 local authorities in England and Wales that were eligible for participation in the program. The study systematically sampled across participating and nonparticipating local authorities, "actionable" and "nonactionable" radon-affected areas, and geographic regions with different campaign histories (Wales, Southwest England, and the rest of England). As a multistage sampling strategy was used, the data were analyzed from a multilevel perspective. This study found that participants living in participating local authorities had higher levels of awareness and were more likely to have tested their home for radon than participants living in nonparticipating local authorities. Similar results were found for participants living in "actionable" areas as compared to those living in "nonactionable" radon-affected areas. The study further found that radon awareness and testing rates were the highest in Southwest England and the lowest in Wales. This study suggests that the radon roll-out program has been effective in raising awareness and testing rates, and that ongoing domestic radon campaigns in Southwest England may have raised radon awareness and testing in these areas, showing important reinforcement effects of multiple risk communication campaigns. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: Much has been written about how the medical home model can enhance patient-centeredness, care continuity, and follow-up, but few comprehensive aids or resources exist to help practices accomplish these aims. The complexity of primary care can overwhelm those concerned with quality improvement.; METHODS: The RE-AIM planning and evaluation model was used to develop a multimedia, multiple-health behavior tool with psychosocial assessment and feedback features to facilitate and guide patient-centered communication, care, and follow-up related to prevention and self-management of the most common adult chronic illnesses seen in primary care.; RESULTS: The Connection to Health Patient Self-Management System, a web-based patient assessment and support resource, was developed using the RE-AIM factors of reach (e.g., allowing input and output via choice of different modalities), effectiveness (e.g., using evidence-based intervention strategies), adoption (e.g., assistance in integrating the system into practice workflows and permitting customization of the website and feedback materials by practice teams), implementation (e.g., identifying and targeting actionable priority behavioral and psychosocial issues for patients and teams), and maintenance/sustainability (e.g., integration with current National Committee for Quality Assurance recommendations and clinical pathways of care). Connection to Health can work on a variety of input and output platforms, and assesses and provides feedback on multiple health behaviors and multiple chronic conditions frequently managed in adult primary care. As such, it should help to make patient-healthcare team encounters more informed and patient-centered. Formative research with clinicians indicated that the program addressed a number of practical concerns and they appreciated the flexibility and how the Connection to Health program could be customized to their office.; CONCLUSIONS: This primary care practice tool based on an implementation science model has the potential to guide patients to more healthful behaviors and improved self-management of chronic conditions, while fostering effective and efficient communication between patients and their healthcare team. RE-AIM and similar models can help clinicians and media developers create practical products more likely to be widely adopted, feasible in busy medical practices, and able to produce public health impact.

AB Rare diseases, which (by definition) occur at a frequency less than 1/2000 per allele - are individually rare, yet common collectively (10% affected and 50% carrier rates). There are 1800 genes which have tests considered highly predictive and actionable. Human genes with known variants causing insomnia, narcolepsy, and circadian variation include Prion Protein Fatal Familial Insomnia (PRNP), hypocretin (HCRT), DQ beta 1 (DQB1), and period circadian protein homolog (PER2). We have developed human genome sequencing technology that lowered costs a million-fold over the past 6 yr. This has increasingly enabled the use of the causative alleles above, which are far more valuable than merely correlated or common variants. To expand this further we have established community resources for open access collection, integration and interpretation of diverse personal genomic, environmental and trait data evidence.personalgenomes.org).

AB Traditional approaches to sequence analysis are widely used to guide therapy for patients with lung and colorectal cancer and for patients with melanoma, sarcomas (eg, gastrointestinal stromal tumor), and subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach holds a number of potential advantages over traditional methods, including the ability to fully sequence large numbers of genes (hundreds to thousands) in a single test and simultaneously detect deletions, insertions, copy number alterations, translocations, and exome-wide base substitutions (including known "hot-spot mutations") in all known cancer-related genes. Adoption of clinical NGS testing will place significant demands on laboratory infrastructure and will require extensive computational expertise and a deep knowledge of cancer medicine and biology to generate truly useful "clinically actionable" reports. It is anticipated that continuing advances in NGS technology will lower the overall cost, speed the turnaround time, increase the breadth of genome sequencing, detect epigenetic markers and other important genomic parameters, and become applicable to smaller and smaller specimens, including circulating tumor cells and circulating free DNA in plasma.

AB BACKGROUND: Physician recommendation is one of the most important determinants of obtaining colorectal cancer (CRC) screening; however, little is known about the degree to which CRC screening discussions include information that patients report as important to guide screening decisions. This study examines and compares both patient rated importance and physician communication of key information elements about CRC screening during annual physical examinations.; METHODS: ; DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort.; SETTING: 26 ambulatory clinics of an integrated delivery system in the Midwest.; PARTICIPANTS: 64 primary care physicians and 415 patients aged 50 to 80 due for CRC screening. Patients completed a previsit survey to assess importance of specific information when making a preventive screening decision. Visits were audio recorded to assess the content of screening discussions.; RESULTS: Most patients rated test accuracy (85%), testing alternatives (83%), the pros and cons of testing (86%), and the testing process (78%) very important when making preventive screening decisions. Ninety-one percent of visits included a CRC screening discussion; however, CRC screening talk rarely included information that patients rated as important. Physicians infrequently asked whether patients had questions pertaining to CRC screening (5%); however, 49% of patients asked a CRC screening question, with the vast majority pertaining to screening logistics.; CONCLUSIONS: Audio recordings confirm that discussions of CRC screening are often lacking information that patients indicate is very important when making preventive health decisions and patient questions during the visit are not eliciting information to fill the gap.; IMPACT: These findings provide actionable information to improve CRC screening discussions. ©2011 AACR

AB BACKGROUND: Many women with symptoms suggestive of a breast cancer diagnosis delay presentation to their family physician. Although factors associated with delay have been well described, there is a paucity of data on strategies to mitigate delay.; OBJECTIVES: We conducted a qualitative research project to examine factors related to delay and to identify health care system changes that might encourage earlier presentation.; METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with women who sought care 12 weeks or more after self-detection of breast cancer symptoms and with family physicians whose practices included patients meeting that criterion.; RESULTS: The women and physicians both suggested a need for clearer screening mammography guidelines for women 40-49 years of age and for better messaging concerning breast awareness. The use of additional hopeful testimonials from breast cancer survivors were suggested to help dispel the notion of cancer as a "death sentence." Educational initiatives were proposed, aimed at both increasing awareness of "non-lump" breast cancer symptoms and advising women that a previous benign diagnosis does not ensure that future symptoms are not cancer. Women wanted empathic nonjudgmental access to care. Improved methods to track compliance with screening mammography and with periodic health exams and access to a rapid diagnostic process were suggested.; CONCLUSIONS: A list of "at-risk situations for delay" in diagnosis of breast cancer was developed for physicians to assist in identifying women who might delay. Health care system changes actionable both at the health policy level and in the family physician's office were identified to encourage earlier presentation of women with symptomatic breast cancer.

AB This paper provides a review of the importance of primary care psychiatry within an Australian context. The aims of this review are: (1) to emphasize the integral role of mental health in overall health and well-being, (2) to elucidate the factors that make the provision of primary care psychiatry essential, and (3) to review the impact of the Australian government's mental health policy initiatives on the mental health of the Australian population as well as on the practice of primary care psychiatry. From this review, it is evident that the discipline of psychiatry is integral to the overall health of the community. Furthermore, it is apparent that primary care psychiatry has a large and pivotal role to play in the prevention, treatment, and early detection of mental disorders in Australia and worldwide. The article concludes with some simple, actionable recommendations for the practice of primary care psychiatry.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify generalizable ways that comorbidity affects older adults' experiences in a health service program directed toward an index condition and to develop a framework to assist clinicians in approaching comorbidity in the design, delivery, and evaluation of such interventions.; DESIGN: A qualitative data content analysis of interview transcripts to identify themes related to comorbidity.; SETTING: An outpatient low-vision rehabilitation program for macular disease.; PARTICIPANTS: In 2007/08, 98 individuals undergoing low-vision rehabilitation and their companions provided 624 semistructured interviews that elicited perceptions about barriers and facilitators of successful program participation.; RESULTS: The interviews revealed five broad themes about comorbidity: (i) "good days, bad days," reflecting participants' fluctuating health status during the program because of concurrent medical problems; (ii) "communication barriers." which were sometimes due to participant impairments and sometimes situational; (iii) "overwhelmed," which encompassed pragmatic and emotional concerns of participants and caregivers; (iv) "delays," which referred to the tendency of comorbidities to delay progress in the program and to confer added inconvenience during lengthy appointments; and (v) value of companion involvement in overcoming some barriers imposed by comorbid conditions.; CONCLUSION: This study provides a taxonomy and conceptual framework for understanding consequences of comorbidity in the experience of individuals receiving a health service. If confirmed in individuals receiving interventions for other index diseases, the framework suggests actionable items to improve care and facilitate research involving older adults. © 2011, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2011, The American Geriatrics Society.

AB Microfluidic diagnostic devices promise faster disease identification by purifying and concentrating low-abundance analytes from a flowing sample. The diagnosis of sepsis, a whole body inflammatory response often caused by microbial infections of the blood, is a model system for pursuing the advantages of microfluidic devices over traditional diagnostic protocols. Traditional sepsis diagnoses require large blood samples and several days to culture and identify the low concentration microbial agent. During these long delays while culturing, the physician has little or no actionable information to treat this acute illness. We designed a microfluidic chip using dielectrophoresis to sort and concentrate the target microbe from a flowing blood sample. This design was optimized using the applicable electrokinetic and hydrodynamic theories. We quantify the sorting efficiency of this device using growth-based assays which show 30% of injected microbes are recovered viable, consistent with the electroporation of target cells by the dielectrophoretic cell sorters. Finally, the results illustrate the device is capable of a five-fold larger microbe concentration in the target analyte stream compared to the waste stream at a continuous sample flow rate of 35 mul∕h.

AB CONTEXT: America's Health Rankings (AHR) is a state-level ranking of health determinants and outcomes produced annually by the United Health Foundation.; OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine how states-particularly state health departments (SHDs)-respond to the annual AHR report.; DESIGN: This study utilized a mixed methods approach involving key informant (KI) interviews in selected SHDs and a survey of the 50 state health officials (SHOs).; SETTING: Key informants were interviewed at SHD offices in 9 states. The survey was conducted using an online format.; PARTICIPANTS: Key informants included the SHO, senior staff in the SHD, and public health partners outside the SHD organization. Survey respondents were the SHO or designee.'; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Awareness, use, utility, and value of AHR.; RESULTS: Between the interviews and online survey, respondents from at least 40 of the 50 states indicated they were aware of AHR. Fifty-three interview sessions were conducted with 66 different KIs. Of the 37 states providing usable survey information, 20 (54%) reported that AHR was moderately, very, or extremely useful to their agency. Survey respondents indicated that the most common uses of AHR are for problem identification (54%), a source of data (49%), and for grant applications (38%). Regarding overall value of AHR to states, on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being no value to 10 being highly valuable, the mean score from survey respondents was 4.7.; CONCLUSION: Although there is a wide spectrum of knowledge about AHR and responses to the annual report, the majority of SHDs respond in more positive than negative ways. Although the majority of SHOs are aware of AHR, there is less understanding of the methodology in the rankings at the programmatic level. The strongest call for change related to making the report more actionable, especially by identifying best practices.

AB Antibiotic resistance, a global concern, is particularly pressing in developing nations, including India, where the burden of infectious disease is high and healthcare spending is low. The Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP) was established to develop actionable policy recommendations specifically relevant to low- and middle-income countries where suboptimal access to antibiotics - not a major concern in high-income countries - is possibly as severe a problem as is the spread of resistant organisms. This report summarizes the situation as it is known regarding antibiotic use and growing resistance in India and recommends short and long term actions. Recommendations aim at (i) reducing the need for antibiotics; (ii) lowering resistance-enhancing drug pressure through improved antibiotic targeting, and (iii) eliminating antibiotic use for growth promotion in agriculture. The highest priority needs to be given to (i) national surveillance of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic use - better information to underpin decisions on standard treatment guidelines, education and other actions, as well as to monitor changes over time; (ii) increasing the use of diagnostic tests, which necessitates behavioural changes and improvements in microbiology laboratory capacity; (iii) setting up and/or strengthening infection control committees in hospitals; and (iv) restricting the use of antibiotics for non-therapeutic uses in agriculture. These interventions should help to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance, improve public health directly, benefit the populace and reduce pressure on the healthcare system. Finally, increasing the types and coverage of childhood vaccines offered by the government would reduce the disease burden enormously and spare antibiotics.

AB The role of genomics in personalized medicine continues to undergo profound changes, in step with dramatic technological advances. Ability to sequence the entire human genome with relative ease raises expectations that we can use an individual's complete genomic blueprint to understand disease risk and predicting therapy outcomes, thereby, optimizing drug therapy. Yet, doubts persist as to what extent genetic/genomic factors influence disease and treatment outcomes or whether robust predictive biomarker tests can be developed. Encompassing more than just DNA sequences, the definition of genomics now often is taken to include transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics, with integration of genomic and environmental factors, in an area referred to systems biology. While we can learn much about a cell's innermost workings, summation of these diverse areas is far from enabling the prediction of therapeutic outcomes. Typically, only a handful of specific biomarkers, genetic or otherwise, are 'actionable', i.e., they can be used to guide therapy. I will focus on pharmacogenetic biomarkers, highlighting current successes but also the main challenges that remain in optimizing individualized therapy. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUND: When patients need health information to manage their personal health, they turn to both health professionals and other patients. Yet, we know little about how the information exchanged among patients (ie, patient expertise) contrasts with the information offered by health professionals (ie, clinician expertise). Understanding how patients' experiential expertise contrasts with the medical expertise of health professionals is necessary to inform the design of peer-support tools that meet patients' needs, particularly with the growing prevalence of largely unguided advice sharing through Internet-based social software.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to enhance our understanding of patient expertise and to inform the design of peer-support tools. We compared the characteristics of patient expertise with that of clinician expertise for breast cancer.; METHODS: Through a comparative content analysis of topics discussed and recommendations offered in Internet message boards and books, we contrasted the topic, form, and style of expertise shared in sources of patient expertise with sources of clinician expertise.; RESULTS: Patient expertise focused on strategies for coping with day-to-day personal health issues gained through trial and error of the lived experience; thus, it was predominately personal in topic. It offered a wealth of actionable advice that was frequently expressed through the narrative style of personal stories about managing responsibilities and activities associated with family, friends, work, and the home during illness. In contrast, clinician expertise was carried through a prescriptive style and focused on explicit facts and opinions that tied closely to the health care delivery system, biomedical research, and health professionals' work. These differences were significant between sources of patient expertise and sources of clinician expertise in topic (P < .001), form (P < .001), and style (P < .001).; CONCLUSION: Patients offer other patients substantial expertise that differs significantly from the expertise offered by health professionals. Our findings suggest that experienced patients do not necessarily serve as "amateur doctors" who offer more accessible but less comprehensive or detailed medical information. Rather, they offer valuable personal information that clinicians cannot necessarily provide. The characteristics of patient expertise and the resulting design implications that we identified will help informaticians enhance the design of peer-support tools that will help meet patients' diverse information needs.

AB  "Social autopsy" refers to an interview process aimed at identifying social, behavioral, and health systems contributors to maternal and child deaths. It is often combined with a verbal autopsy interview to establish the biological cause of death. Two complementary purposes of social autopsy include providing population-level data to health care programmers and policymakers to utilize in developing more effective strategies for delivering maternal and child health care technologies, and increasing awareness of maternal and child death as preventable problems in order to empower communities to participate and engage health programs to increase their responsiveness and accountability.Through a comprehensive review of the literature, this paper examines the concept and development of social autopsy, focusing on the contributions of the Pathway Analysis format for child deaths and the Maternal and Perinatal Death Inquiry and Response program in India to social autopsy's success in meeting key objectives. The Pathway Analysis social autopsy format, based on the Pathway to Survival model designed to support the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness approach, was developed from 1995 to 2001 and has been utilized in studies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Adoption of the Pathway model has enriched the data gathered on care seeking for child illnesses and supported the development of demand- and supply-side interventions. The instrument has recently been updated to improve the assessment of neonatal deaths and is soon to be utilized in large-scale population-representative verbal/social autopsy studies in several African countries. Maternal death audit, starting with confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in Britain more than 50 years ago, is a long-accepted strategy for reducing maternal mortality. More recently, maternal social autopsy studies that supported health programming have been conducted in several developing countries. From 2005 to 2009, 10 high-mortality states in India conducted community-based maternal verbal/social autopsies with participatory data sharing with communities and health programs that resulted in the implementation of numerous data-driven maternal health interventions.Social autopsy is a powerful tool with the demonstrated ability to raise awareness, provide evidence in the form of actionable data and increase motivation at all levels to take appropriate and effective actions. Further development of the methodology along with standardized instruments and supporting tools are needed to promote its wide-scale adoption and use.

AB Understanding existing levels of genetic diversity of sheep breeds facilitates in situ and ex situ conservation activities. A comprehensive evaluation of US sheep breeds has not been previously performed; therefore, we evaluated the genetic diversity among and within 28 US sheep breeds. Both major and minor breeds were included in the analysis and consisted of 666 animals from 222 producers located in 38 states. The level of within-breed genetic diversity was variable and not dependent upon status of a breed as a major or minor breed. Bayesian cluster analysis indicated the breeds were grouped more by physiological differences (meat vs. wool production) rather than geographic origin. Results suggest several actionable items to improve in situ and ex situ conservation. The results clearly identify breeds in need of increased in situ and ex situ management (e.g., Hog Island and Karakul) and allow several suggestions for in situ management of flocks. Conversely, several of the breeds appear genetically similar and therefore require less emphasis on collecting germplasm samples for the gene bank. Commercially important breeds (e.g., Rambouillet and Suffolk) were found to have substantial variation, which should enable breeders to proceed, unencumbered by genetic diversity concerns, with selection strategies that maximize profit. © 2011 American Society of Animal Science.

AB Black women die of breast cancer at a much higher rate than white women. Recent studies have suggested that this racial disparity might be even greater in Chicago than the country as a whole. When data describing this racial disparity are presented they are sometimes attributed in part to racial differences in tumor biology. Vital records data were employed to calculate age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates for women in Chicago, New York City and the United States from 1980-2005. Race-specific rate ratios were used to measure the disparity in breast cancer mortality. Breast cancer mortality rates by race are the main outcome. In all three geographies the rate ratios were approximately equal in 1980 and stayed that way until the early 1990s, when the white rates started to decline while the black rates remained rather constant. By 2005 the black:white rate ratio was 1.36 in NYC, 1.38 in the US, and 1.98 in Chicago. In any number of ways these data are inconsistent with the notion that the disparity in black:white breast cancer mortality rates is a function of differential biology. Three societal hypotheses are posited that may explain this disparity. All three are actionable, beginning today.

AB New findings are rapidly revealing an increasingly detailed image of neural- and molecular-level dysfunction in schizophrenia, distributed throughout interconnected cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuitry. Some disturbances appear to reflect failures of early brain maturation, that become codified into dysfunctional circuit properties, resulting in a substantial loss of, or failure to develop, both cells and/or appropriate connectivity across widely dispersed brain regions. These circuit disturbances are variable across individuals with schizophrenia, perhaps reflecting the interaction of multiple different risk genes and epigenetic events. Given these complex and variable hard-wired circuit disturbances, it is worth considering how new and emerging findings can be integrated into actionable treatment models. This paper suggests that future efforts towards developing more effective therapeutic approaches for the schizophrenias should diverge from prevailing models in genetics and molecular neuroscience, and focus instead on a more practical three-part treatment strategy: 1) systematic rehabilitative psychotherapies designed to engage healthy neural systems to compensate for and replace dysfunctional higher circuit elements, used in concert with 2) medications that specifically target cognitive mechanisms engaged by these rehabilitative psychotherapies, and 3) antipsychotic medications that target nodal or convergent circuit points within the limbic-motor interface, to constrain the scope and severity of psychotic exacerbations and thereby facilitate engagement in cognitive rehabilitation. The use of targeted cognitive rehabilitative psychotherapy plus synergistic medication has both common sense and time-tested efficacy with numerous other neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB CONTEXT: Clinical pathology (CP) laboratories are used for millions of tests each year. These lead to thousands of calls to CP residents. However, although laboratory utilization is a frequent topic of study, clinical utilization--the content of the interactions between clinicians and CP residents--is not. Because it reflects questions about laboratory utilization, clinical utilization could suggest ways to improve both training and care by reducing diagnostic error.; OBJECTIVES: To build and implement a secure, scalable Web-based system to allow CP residents at any hospital to track the calls they receive, the interaction's context, and the action taken as a result, with evidence where applicable, and to use this system to report on clinical utilization at a major academic hospital.; DESIGN: Entries were analyzed from a nearly year-long period to describe the clinical utilization of CP at a large academic teaching hospital.; RESULTS: Sixteen residents logged 847 calls during 10 months, roughly evenly distributed among transfusion medicine, chemistry, microbiology, and hematopathology. Calls covered 94 different analytes in chemistry and 71 different organisms or tests in microbiology. Analysis revealed areas where CP can improve clinical care through educating the clinical services, for example, about ordering Rh immune globulin, testosterone testing, and diagnosis of tick-borne diseases. Documenting calls also highlighted patterns among residents.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinical utilization is a potentially rich knowledge base for improving patient care and resident training. Our resident call-tracking system is a useful way for measuring clinical utilization and mining it for actionable information.

AB Patients with locally advanced/inflammatory breast cancer (LABC/IBC) face a high likelyhood of recurrence and prognosis for relapsed, or de novo stage IV metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains poor. Estrogen (ER) and HER2 receptor expression on primary or MBC allow targeted therapies, but an estimated 10-18% of tumors do not exhibit these biomarkers and survival in these cases is even poorer. Variations in discordance rates for the expression of ER and HER2 receptors have been observed between primary and metastatic tumors and such discordances may lead to suboptimal treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are considered the seeds of residual disease and distant metastases and their characterization could help guide treatment selection. To explore this possibility, we used multiple biomarker assessment of CTCs in comparison to primary and metastatic tumor sites. Thirty-six patients with LABC/IBC, or stage IV MBC were evaluated. Blood samples were procured prior to initiating or changing therapy. CTCs were identified based on presence of cytokeratin and nucleus staining, and the absence of CD45. A multimarker assay was developed to simultaneously quantify expression of HER2, ER, and ERCC1, a DNA excision repair protein. Novel fiber-optic array scanning technology (FAST) was used for sensitive location of CTCs. CTCs were detected in 82% of MBC and 62% LABC/IBC cases. Multiplex marker expression was successfully carried out in samples from18 patients with MBC and in 8 patients with LABC/IBC that contained CTCs. In MBC, we detected actionable discordance rates of 40 and 23%, respectively for ER and HER2 where a biomarker was negative in the primary or metastatic tumor and positive in the CTCs. In LABC/IBC, actionable discordances were 60 and 20% for ER and HER2, respectively. Pilot trials evaluating the effectiveness of treatment selections based on actionable discordances between biomarker expression patterns on CTCs and primary or metastatic tumor sites may allow for a prospective assessment of CTC-based individualized targeted therapies.

AB Ethicists contend that researchers are obliged to report genetic research findings to individual study participants when they are clinically significant, that is, when they are clinically useful or personally meaningful to participants. Yet whether such standards are well understood and can be consistently applied remains unknown. We conducted an international, cross-sectional survey of cystic fibrosis (CF) and autism genetics researchers using a quasi-experimental design to explore factors influencing researchers' judgments. Eighty percent of researchers agreed, in principle, that clinically significant findings should be reported to individual participants. Yet judgments about when a specific finding was considered clinically significant or warranted reporting varied by scientific factors (replication, robustness, intentionality, and disease context), capacity of the research team to explain the results, and type of research ethics guidance. Further, judgments were influenced by the researchers' disease community (autism or CF), their primary role (clinical, molecular, statistical) and their beliefs regarding a general reporting obligation. In sum, judgments about the clinical significance of genetic research results, and about whether they should be reported, are influenced by scientific parameters as well as contextual factors related to the specific research project and the individual researcher. These findings call into question the assumption that the conditions under which an obligation to disclose arises are uniformly understood and actionable. Adjudicating the clinical readiness of provisional data may be a responsibility better suited to evaluative experts at arms' length of the provisional data in question, rather than a responsibility imposed upon researchers themselves.

AB In the diagnosis of preinvasive breast cancer, some of the intraductal proliferations pose a special challenge. The continuum of intraductal breast lesions includes the usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current standard of care is to perform percutaneous needle biopsies for diagnosis of palpable and image-detected breast abnormalities. UDH is considered benign and patients diagnosed UDH undergo routine follow-up, whereas ADH and DCIS are considered actionable and patients diagnosed with these two subtypes get additional surgical procedures. About 250,000 new cases of intraductal breast lesions are diagnosed every year. A conservative estimate would suggest that at least 50% of these patients are needlessly undergoing unnecessary surgeries. Thus, improvement in the diagnostic reproducibility and accuracy is critically important for effective clinical management of these patients. In this study, a prototype system for automatically classifying breast microscopic tissues to distinguish between UDH and actionable subtypes (ADH and DCIS) is introduced. This system automatically evaluates digitized slides of tissues for certain cytological criteria and classifies the tissues based on the quantitative features derived from the images. The system is trained using a total of 327 regions of interest (ROIs) collected across 62 patient cases and tested with a sequestered set of 149 ROIs collected across 33 patient cases. An overall accuracy of 87.9% is achieved on the entire test data. The test accuracy of 84.6% is obtained with borderline cases (26 of the 33 test cases) only, when compared against the diagnostic accuracies of nine pathologists on the same set (81.2% average), indicates that the system is highly competitive with the expert pathologists as a stand-alone diagnostic tool and has a great potential in improving diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility when used as a "second reader" in conjunction with the pathologists. © 2011 IEEE

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to determine the usefulness of multiplanar and 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of computed tomographic (CT) data from scans performed for maternal indications for visualizing fetal anatomy and estimating gestational age.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen pregnant patients who had abdominopelvic CT scanning performed for maternal indications formed the study group. Two independent reviewers created multiplanar and 3D-reconstructed images of the fetus from these CT scans and analyzed them for fetal anatomy and gestational age. Fetal dose estimates were also obtained.; RESULTS: Computed tomographic fetal biometry generally agreed well with ultrasound estimates. Computed tomographic and ultrasound estimates were within 3 to 4 weeks of each other 95% of the time for the 2 reviewers. Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.989 for reviewer 1 and 0.985 for reviewer 2. Fetal anatomic survey revealed that it was easier to see bones and fluid-filled structures such as the stomach and urinary bladder than intracranial, intrathoracic, and intra-abdominal soft tissue structures. Estimated fetal dose was 28.5 (10.7) mGy using the Imaging Performance Assessment of CT Scanner calculator and 23.7 (7.7) mGy when taking maternal perimeter and fetal depth into account with the method of Angel et al.; CONCLUSIONS: It is technically feasible to produce clinically useful images of the fetus using standard multiplanar reconstructions and 3D algorithms already in place for CT scanning. As CT scans continue to be performed under certain circumstances, particularly the emergency department setting, evaluation of maternal CT scans for potentially useful information about the fetus such as gestational age and gross anatomic survey can be obtained at estimated fetal radiation doses much lower than the actionable level of 150 mGy.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a presenteeism assessment, the Well-Being Assessment for Productivity (WBA-P), that provides an informative evaluation of job performance loss due to well-being related barriers.; METHOD: The WBA-P was developed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis using survey data from 1827 employed individuals. Evidence of criterion-related validity was established using multivariate analysis of variance across measures of health and well-being.; RESULTS: A hierarchical, two-factor model demonstrated good fit and included factors capturing productivity loss from personal reasons (WBA-PP) and work environment (WBA-PW). Significant interactions existed between these and previously validated presenteeism measures with respect to physical and emotional health, risk factors, and life evaluation.; CONCLUSIONS: This initial psychometric evidence suggests that the WBA-P and its subscales are valid measures of presenteeism that capture actionable well-being-related performance barriers.

AB BACKGROUND: The Surgical Morbidity and Mortality conference has long been used as an opportunity for both process improvement and resident education. With recent heightened focus on creating environments of safety and on meeting the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) General Competencies, novel approaches are required. With the understanding that the provision of medical care is an inherently multidisciplinary enterprise, we advocate the creation and use of a Multidisciplinary Morbidity and Mortality conference (MM&M) as a means to establish this culture of safety while teaching the ACGME General Competencies to surgery residents.; METHODS: A quarterly MM&M conference was implemented to foster communication between disciplines, provide a forum for quality improvement, and enhance patient care. All stakeholders in the perioperative enterprise attend, including the departments of surgery, anesthesia, radiology, pharmacy, nursing, environmental services, risk management, and patient services. Cases that expose system issues with potential to harm patients are discussed in an open, nonconfrontational forum. Solutions are presented and initiatives developed to improve patient outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed the topics presented since the conference's inception, grouping them into 1 of 7 categories. We then evaluated the completion of the improvement initiatives developed after discussion at the conference.; RESULTS: Over a 21-month period, 11 cases were discussed with 23 "actionable" initiatives for quality improvement. Cases were grouped by category; procedures (36.5%), process (36.5%), patient-related (9%), communication (9%), medication (9%), device (0%), and ethics (0%). All cases discussed addressed at least 4 of the 6 ACGME General Competencies.; CONCLUSIONS: Like the practice of medicine, the occurrence of adverse outcomes is frequently multidisciplinary. An MM&M conference is useful in its potential to meet ACGME General Competencies, engender a culture of patient safety, and rapidly achieve quality improvement and systems health care delivery initiatives in a large academic medical center.

AB PURPOSE: To demonstrate possible superiority in the performance of a radiologist who is tasked with detecting actionable nodules and aided by the bone suppression and soft-tissue visualization algorithm of a new software program that produces a modified image by suppressing the ribs and clavicles, filtering noise, and equalizing the contrast in the area of the lungs.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study and use of anonymized and deidentified data received approval from the MedStar-Georgetown University Oncology Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from 15 study radiologists. The study radiologists participated as observers in a reader study of 368 patients in an approximately 2:1 cancer-free-to-cancer ratio. The localized receiver operating characteristic (LROC) method was used for analyses. Images were rerandomized for each radiologist. Each patient image was sequentially read, first with the standard radiograph and then with the software-aided image. Normal studies were confirmed with computed tomography (CT), follow-up, and/or panel consensus.; RESULTS: Each reader and the combined scores of the 15 readers showed improvement. The area under the combined LROC curve increased significantly from 0.460 unaided to 0.558 aided by visualization software (P = .0001). When measured according to the reader's indication that a case should be sent or not sent for CT or biopsy, sensitivity for cancer detection increased from 49.5% unaided to 66.3% aided by software (P < .0001); specificity decreased from 96.1% to 91.8% (P = .004). Seventy-four percent of the aided detections occurred in cancers with 70% or greater overlap of the bone and the nodule.; CONCLUSION: The radiologists using visualization software significantly increased their detection of lung cancers and benign nodules.

AB The nature of the local health authorities (LHAs) in the Italian National Health Service has been deeply reformed during the 1990s by new public management (NPM) reforms that introduced decentralization, quasi-market and managerialism. These reforms implied that the main role of LHA is to govern the production of health services in their area (steer) rather than to only directly produce services (row). After more than 15 years from these reforms of Italian healthcare, we describe how much the steering versus rowing dichotomy made an impact on LHA activity, through an analysis of the management control systems they set up for themselves and the subsequent qualitative analysis of the opinions that a diverse group of managers expressed during 8 days of group discussion. Results show that managers of Italian LHAs, when only a small part of services is produced, tend to perceive their steering role as impossible to play and focus on production, leaving therefore ungoverned a significant part of the services offered to residents. NPM, therefore, was able to influence the reform of Italian healthcare but, as suggested by a postmodernist interpretation, left managers with a rhetoric change based on inconsistent assumptions instead of actionable ideas to manage the change process.

AB Converting the findings from addictions studies into information actionable by (non-research) treatment programs is important to improving program outcomes. This paper describes the translation of the findings of studies on Patient-Services matching, prediction of patient response to treatment (Expected Treatment Response) and prediction of dropout to provide evidence-based decision support in routine treatment. The findings of the studies and their application to the development of an outcomes management system are described. Implementation issues in a network of addictions treatment programs are discussed. The work illustrates how outcomes management systems can play an important role in translating research into practice. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB DNA sequence analysis has become a significant laboratory test in oncology, permitting treatment to become increasingly personalized for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Traditional approaches to sequence analysis, including Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing and allele-specific PCR, are now widely used to guide therapy for patients diagnosed with lung and colorectal cancer as well as for melanoma, sarcomas (e.g., gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma. Traditional sequence analysis has been limited in bandwidth and throughput and as a result, has been focused exclusively on testing the most common aberrations in key genes or fully sequencing single genes. The massively parallel or next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to DNA analysis holds a number of potential advantages over the traditional methods, including the ability to fully sequence large numbers of genes (hundreds to thousands) in a single test. Furthermore, NGS can simultaneously detect deletions, insertions, copy number alterations, translocations and exome-wide base substitutions (including known hot-spot mutations) in all known cancer-related genes. However, significant challenges, particularly with respect to demands on expertise and infrastructure, will have to be overcome to translate NGS to the bedside of the cancer patient. Extensive computational expertise is required to bring NGS into clinical context, and a deep knowledge of cancer medicine and cancer biology will be required to generate truly useful, so-called 'clinically actionable' reports for clinicians. While NGS is on the cusp of being launched as a clinical test, it may be expected that the near future will continue to bring major advances in the technology that will lower the overall cost, speed up the turnaround time, increase the breadth of genome sequencing, and detect epigenetic markers and other important genomic parameters, while becoming applicable to smaller and smaller specimens, including circulating tumor cells and circulating free DNA in plasma.

AB Although undernutrition impacts a range of short- and long-term outcomes, nutrition often has low priority on global and national development policy agendas because of overemphasis on technical solutions without adequate consideration of contextual and political factors. An approach is needed for strategic development of nutrition agendas that embraces the contexts influencing policy and program planning and implementation, while addressing salient causes of undernutrition. We describe a simple, comprehensive assessment approach to enable development of sound nutrition strategies and well-grounded effective and appropriate actions for nutrition in a given context. The conceptual framework for this assessment approach incorporates three domains, each essential for defining strategic actions for nutrition: epidemiologic, pertaining to the nutritional situation and the evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of nutrition interventions; operational, pertaining to coverage, quality, and utilization of nutrition-related interventions and programs as well as capacities, opportunities, and constraints to improving these; and sociopolitical, pertaining to social, political, cultural, and organizational factors at various levels, which may enhance or inhibit efforts to create positive changes in policies and programs. The domains are interlinked, and the sociopolitical domain often underlies the other two domains. Using this framework can reveal important insights for the nutrition policy agenda that were hitherto not considered explicitly in efforts to advance nutrition. This is highlighted in an example from Vietnam and through other papers in this Supplement. Use of this three-domain assessment framework can greatly aid development of feasible and actionable nutrition strategies that are grounded in epidemiologic, operational, and sociopolitical realities.

AB Remote patient management utilizing the Internet is a milestone in the management of patients with an implantable cardiac device. Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) store diagnostic information about device and lead integrity, the occurrence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and parameters that may reflect on a patient's heart failure status. Previously, these data could only be retrieved with a programmer at an in-person office visit. The introduction of remote follow-up and monitoring has changed the paradigm for the management of patients with implanted devices. Remote follow-up has been shown to be superior to traditional transtelephonic monitoring for the detection of clinically actionable events in pacemaker patients. Remote monitoring using ICDs with wireless technology has been demonstrated to result in detection of lead malfunction and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias while reducing the need for in-office evaluations without compromising patient safety. Studies are underway to evaluate the clinical utility of identification of atrial high-rate episodes and to identify patients at risk for exacerbation of heart failure. Remote monitoring technology has yet to be universally adopted by patients or physicians. Impediments to the implementation of remote monitoring including issues related to work flow and data management are explored.

AB Children's hospitals and their affiliated departments of pediatrics often pursue separate programs in quality and safety; by integrating these programs, they can accelerate progress. Hospital executives and pediatric department chairs from 14 children's hospitals have been exploring practical approaches for integrating quality programs. Three components provide focus: (1) alignment of quality priorities and resources across the organizations; (2) education and training for physicians in the science of improvement; and (3) professional development and career progression for physicians in recognition of quality-improvement activities. Process and resource requirements are identified for each component, and specific, actionable steps are identified. The action steps are arrayed on a continuum from basic to advanced integration. The resulting matrix serves as an "integration framework," useful to a hospital and its pediatric academic department at any stage of integration for assessing its current state, plotting a path toward further integration, tracking its progress, and identifying potential collaborators and models of advanced integration. The framework contributes to health care's quality-improvement movement in multiple ways: it addresses a basic impediment to quality and safety improvement; it is an implementable model for integrating quality programs; it offers career-advancement potential for physicians interested in quality; it helps optimize investments in quality and safety; and it can be applied both within a single children's hospital and across multiple children's hospitals. Widespread adoption of the integration framework could have a transformative effect on the children's hospital sector, not the least of which is improved quality and safety on a large scale.

AB OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of our study was to compare the effect of a chest radiography computer-aided detection (CAD) system on the follow-up recommendations of chest radiologists, general radiologists, and pulmonologists.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A chest radiography CAD system (RapidScreen 1.1) that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a second-generation version of the system (OnGuard 3.0) not yet approved by the FDA were applied to single frontal radiographs of 200 patients at high risk for lung cancer. One hundred patients had actionable nodules (mean size, 16.9 mm) and 100 patients did not. Six chest radiologists, six general radiologists, and six pulmonologists independently interpreted each image first without CAD and then with CAD during blinded reading sessions. The frequency with which readers correctly referred patients for follow-up tests was measured. Differential effects based on nodule size, shape, location, density, and subtlety were tested with multiplevariable logistic regression.; RESULTS: For patients without actionable lesions, pulmonologists showed an increase in their recommendations for follow-up from 0.46 unaided to 0.52 with CAD (p = 0.001), whereas chest and general radiologists had much lower average rates and were not affected by CAD's false marks (0.26 without CAD vs 0.25 with RapidScreen 1.1 and 0.26 with OnGuard 3.0, p ≥ 0.734). CAD improved all readers' detection of moderately subtle lesions (p = 0.013) but did not significantly increase follow-up rates overall for patients with actionable nodules (0.63 unaided vs 0.63 with RapidScreen 1.1, p = 0.795; and 0.63 unaided vs 0.64 with OnGuard 3.0, p = 0.187).; CONCLUSION: The effect of CAD on readers' clinical decisions varies depending on the training of the reader. CAD did not improve the performance of chest or general radiologists. Nonradiologists are particularly vulnerable to CAD's false-positive marks.

AB PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and nature of incidental findings (IF) seen in low-dose computed tomographies (LDCT) from a lung cancer screening study for at-risk individuals.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiology reports from LDCTs of 4073 participants of a lung cancer screening study were retrospectively reviewed for findings other than lung nodules, that is, IFs, which were regarded as actionable. The frequency, nature, and expected cost of these IFs, and their anticipated follow-up were estimated.; RESULTS: There were 880 IFs described in 782 study participants (19%); the median age of the participants was 62 years (range, 46-80 years). More IFs were found in men (55%) than in women. The majority of these findings were noncardiovascular (76%), for which imaging was suggested for 74%. There were 7 severe IFs (0.8%) that merited immediate attention. Seven known cancers were diagnosed from follow-ups of the IFs. The majority of IFs (n = 486 [55%]) would require imaging follow-up if clinically indicated, with an estimated total a cost of CAN$45,500 to CAN$51,000 to provide initial diagnostic workup.; CONCLUSION: IFs on lung cancer screening studies are not uncommon and frequently require imaging or other follow-up for definitive diagnoses and to assess their clinical relevance. The implication of IFs has to be considered when determining a cost-effective and ethical protocol for the utilisation of LDCT in a high-risk population. 2011 Canadian Association of Radiologists.

AB The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports development and universal implementation of a comprehensive electronic infrastructure to support pediatric information functions of the medical home. These functions include (1) timely and continuous management and tracking of health data and services over a patient's lifetime for all providers, patients, families, and guardians, (2) comprehensive organization and secure transfer of health data during patient-care transitions between providers, institutions, and practices, (3) establishment and maintenance of central coordination of a patient's health information among multiple repositories (including personal health records and information exchanges), (4) translation of evidence into actionable clinical decision support, and (5) reuse of archived clinical data for continuous quality improvement. The AAP supports universal, secure, and vendor-neutral portability of health information for all patients contained within the medical home across all care settings (ambulatory practices, inpatient settings, emergency departments, pharmacies, consultants, support service providers, and therapists) for multiple purposes including direct care, personal health records, public health, and registries. The AAP also supports financial incentives that promote the development of information tools that meet the needs of pediatric workflows and that appropriately recognize the added value of medical homes to pediatric care.

AB BACKGROUND: To create a checklist of the tasks that a pharmacist must perform during medication order review in the hospital setting and to evaluate the utility of and pharmacists' satisfaction with the checklist.; METHODS: An evidence-based checklist for medication order review was developed, with items related to order urgency, verification of patients' identity, therapeutic review, and actionable items. Pharmacists were educated about the checklist, and it was made available at 2 community hospitals in an urban setting. Pharmacists completed a nonvalidated satisfaction survey and participated in focus groups or interviews within 3 months after implementation of the checklist. Qualitative descriptive theory was used to identify themes within the data. Near-miss occurrence reports for the 3 months before and after implementation of the checklist were quantified.; RESULTS: Of 16 pharmacists who were involved in the implementation phase, 14 participated in focus groups or an interview, and 11 responded to the survey. All respondents felt that the primary role of the checklist was for training. They felt that the checklist could be useful when reviewing high-alert or unfamiliar medications or therapy for patients with complex medications. The checklist was most helpful when it was used as a reminder, on an as-needed basis. Nine (82%) of the 11 survey respondents indicated that the checklist standardized the process of medication order review, the same number felt that it prevented accidental omission of critical checks, and 8 (73%) felt that it improved patient safety. Education was necessary to reinforce the purpose of the checklist and its self-check nature. There was no difference in the number of near misses in the pharmacy between the 3-month periods before and after implementation of the checklist.; CONCLUSION: Pharmacists participating in the study felt that a checklist for medication order review had a role in training new pharmacists and standardizing processes.

AB With only 0.05% of the total area of the country, Delhi is home to 1.34% of India's population. This creates enormous pressure on natural and man-made resources, and generates situations in which non-health determinants may take precedence over the conventional determinants directly associated with health and healthcare. With the rising advocacy on social determinants of health, several of these factors may rightly seem to be part of the broader territory of health-related variables, and in that context, they may be designated as conventional non-medical determinants. We discuss some more visible domains, such as demography, migration and floating population; the physical and biological environment; economic determinants; social determinants; legislation and enforcement, and underscore some less explored yet critical domains of the determinants related to culture, governance and politics. What emerges as a compelling reality is a wide differential in physical environment, urban planning and access to infrastructural inputs between the privileged and marginalized areas of Delhi. Inequities in physical quality of life are so gross that even a value-neutral, official narrative betrays them helplessly. We propose actionable areas to address some of the pressing non-health determinants of health and healthcare. Copyright 2011, NMJI.

AB CONTEXT: Whole-genome sequencing is becoming increasingly available for research purposes, but it has not yet been routinely used for clinical diagnosis.; OBJECTIVE: To determine whether whole-genome sequencing can identify cryptic, actionable mutations in a clinically relevant time frame.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENT: We were referred a difficult diagnostic case of acute promyelocytic leukemia with no pathogenic X-RARA fusion identified by routine metaphase cytogenetics or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The case patient was enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol, with consent specifically tailored to the implications of whole-genome sequencing. The protocol uses a "movable firewall" that maintains patient anonymity within the entire research team but allows the research team to communicate medically relevant information to the treating physician.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical relevance of whole-genome sequencing and time to communicate validated results to the treating physician.; RESULTS: Massively parallel paired-end sequencing allowed identification of a cytogenetically cryptic event: a 77-kilobase segment from chromosome 15 was inserted en bloc into the second intron of the RARA gene on chromosome 17, resulting in a classic bcr3 PML-RARA fusion gene. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction sequencing subsequently validated the expression of the fusion transcript. Novel FISH probes identified 2 additional cases of t(15;17)-negative acute promyelocytic leukemia that had cytogenetically invisible insertions. Whole-genome sequencing and validation were completed in 7 weeks and changed the treatment plan for the patient.; CONCLUSION: Whole-genome sequencing can identify cytogenetically invisible oncogenes in a clinically relevant time frame.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess compliance with basic and actionable indicators in relation to prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and safe use of heparin.; DESIGN: We built, pilot tested and measured a set of evidence-based structure (existence of guidelines) and process (risk assessment for VTE, and dose adjustment to patient weight and renal function when prescribing heparin) indicators in a nation-wide random sample of 22 hospitals. Compliance with process indicators is estimated at national level and by groups of hospitals (stratified by size). At hospital level, compliance is assessed with Lot Quality Acceptance Sampling, for 85% compliance standard (alpha ≤ 0.05), 55% threshold (beta ≤ 0.10). Contents of existing guidelines are analyzed, and their influence on performance is assessed using logistic regression.; SETTING: Acute care hospitals in Spain.; INTERVENTIONS: None; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Problem identification through indicators assessment.; RESULTS: Less than half of hospitals have guidelines and their contents are very variable and incomplete. No hospital complies with the standard for VTE prevention and only one for heparin dose adjustment. Nationally, VTE risk assessment is performed in 5.8% of patients (95% CI: 5.6-6.0), and heparin dose is explicitly adjusted in 17.5% (95% CI: 16.8-18.2). Performance is relatively higher in large hospitals and it is associated with the existence of guidelines for VTE prevention (OR: 8.3; 95% CI: 2.1-32.1).; CONCLUSIONS: We have identified some actionable contributing factors to safety problems using evidence-based structure and process indicators. Explicit process design and key clinical interventions (risk assessment for VTE and heparin dose adjustment) should be addressed to improve the current situation.

AB We are interested in the kind of knowledge that is particularly relevant to caring practice and the way in which qualitative research findings can serve such knowledge. As phenomenological researchers we have been engaged with the question of how findings from such research can be re-presented and expressed more aesthetically. Such a movement towards a more aesthetic phenomenology may serve the communicative concern to express phenomena relevant to caring practice in ways that appeal to the 'head, hand and heart'. The paper first offers some thoughts about the complex kind of knowledge relevant to caring that is not only technical or propositional, but actionable and aesthetically moving as well. We call this kind of knowledge 'embodied relational understanding'. Further, the paper outlines the development of one way of serving a more aesthetic phenomenology whereby research findings can be faithfully and evocatively translated into more empathically impactful expressions. We call this process 'embodied interpretation'. It is guided by an epistemological framework grounded in the philosophies of Gadamer and Gendlin. We finally illustrate the process with reference to the experience of living after Stroke, and consider the value of this translational process for nursing education and practice.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to create actionable knowledge, making the definition of process improvement projects in health care delivery more effective.; METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of process improvement projects in hospitals, facilitating a case-based reasoning approach to project definition. Data sources were project documentation and hospital-performance statistics of 271 Lean Six Sigma health care projects from 2002 to 2009 of general, teaching, and academic hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium.; RESULTS: Objectives and operational definitions of improvement projects in the sample, analyzed and structured in a uniform format and terminology. Extraction of reusable elements of earlier project definitions, presented in the form of 9 templates called generic project definitions. These templates function as exemplars for future process improvement projects, making the selection, definition, and operationalization of similar projects more efficient. Each template includes an explicated rationale, an operationalization in the form of metrics, and a prototypical example. Thus, a process of incremental and sustained learning based on case-based reasoning is facilitated.; CONCLUSIONS: The quality of project definitions is a crucial success factor in pursuits to improve health care delivery. We offer 9 tried and tested improvement themes related to patient safety, patient satisfaction, and business-economic performance of hospitals.

AB Population-level research into the association between sleep problems and school problems among high-risk youth is limited. This study uses cross-sectional administrative and standardized assessment information for youth entering Tennessee state custody in fiscal year 2009 (n = 4280) to examine whether sleep problems are independently associated with school problems. Sleep problems were identified in 9.8% of the sample. There was no association between sleep and school problems for youth adjudicated delinquent. Among youth adjudicated dependent-neglect/unruly, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicates that youth at risk for sleep problems are 1.78 (95% confidence interval = 1.24-2.55) and youth with actionable sleep problems are 3.30 (95% confidence interval = 1.78-6.14) times more likely than youth without sleep problems to have school problems. Results suggest that the school performance of youth entering state custody adjudicated dependent-neglect/unruly may benefit from systematic screening and intervention for sleep problems.

AB Quality improvement in health care today requires a comprehensive approach. Improvement efforts led by patients, payers, regulators, or health care providers face many barriers. Obstacles include selecting measures with clinical value, building physician acceptance, establishing routine and efficient measurement, and resolving competing clinical demands and work flow impediments. To meet these challenges, the Brigham and Women's Hospital Department of Medicine created a grassroots quality program guided by four main principles: improvement is led by frontline clinicians who select measures important to their patients, performance measurement is automated and accurate, appropriate resources are provided, and interventions are system based and without financial incentives for individual providers. The quality program has engaged the department's physicians from the start. Given the flexibility to define their own metrics according to their patients' needs, clinicians have selected measures related to prevention and wellness, which are often based on national standards. The central quality team facilitates measurement and reporting while providers focus on patient care. The subsequent production of meaningful, actionable data has been instrumental in building physician acceptance and in providing clinicians the opportunity to evaluate and monitor performance. The program's largest challenges have been in capturing meaningful data from electronic systems. The program's system-based focus encourages providers to develop solutions within the existing framework of clinic resources, primarily targeting work flows and processes, while minimizing large expenditures on additional staffing.

AB Although it affects <1% of the US population, stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased in prevalence in the United States, grown 67% between the early 1990s and the first part of this decade. It is important to consider new strategies to slow or halt this increase. A frameshift in patient care delivery is underway in kidney health care in the United States with a Medicare education benefit for patients with stage 4 CKD. This Medicare benefit is a unique program that has the potential to inform patients and families about CKD and prepare them for transitions in health states and kidney health care. For the greatest value of this benefit to be realized, it is critical for the health care community to accurately gauge patient understanding of CKD and provide curricula that are comprehensible and actionable for patients. This type of benefit is patient centered, yet it will succeed only with a willingness to review its effectiveness and revise it if needed. Copyright © 2011 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB Clinical laboratories providing an etiological diagnosis of respiratory tract infections (RTI) have increasingly relied on nucleic acid amplification tests. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods are becoming more standardized, and several have undergone the scrutiny of regulatory agencies mandated to assess the risks and benefits of implementing pathogen-detection assays into diagnostic algorithms. Respiratory viruses lead to both upper and lower RTI and are implicated in exacerbations of chronic pulmonary conditions. Viruses from different taxonomic families present with overlapping clinical signs and symptoms, necessitating an accurate laboratory diagnosis. The clinical utility of diagnostic algorithms incorporating tests for respiratory viruses will depend on the breadth of pathogen coverage and the time to reliable and actionable results. This review covers strategies for detecting a panel of respiratory viruses employed over the last decade that have enabled an etiological diagnosis of RTI in a cost-effective manner. © 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB St. Jamestown is the most densely populated vertical immigrant-receiving urban neighbourhood in Canada. The Photovoice project engaged and empowered immigrant residents of St. Jamestown to influence public policy and secure improved local services for promoting health and well-being. Twenty-seven residents used photography and storytelling to record neighbourhood characteristics and their implications on residents' health and well-being. Eight participants presented recommendations actionable at neighbourhood level to the councillor and worked with the city to carry out the recommendations made that were recognized as important for neighbourhood residents' health and well-being. The results indicate Photovoice can be used to generate dialogue on community concerns and priorities and promote community action.

AB Neighbors Connected is a community-based intervention in the Netherlands. It helps the active older people to organize social activities for their less active older neighbors, facilitated by practical and financial support from the Community Health Service. The intervention is the outcome of a combination of semi-structured interviews with the older people, with organizations for older people and with local policy-makers, epidemiological data and interactive discussions, all of which support the notion that engaging in social activities is a way to enhance healthy ageing within the community. The use of different sources of evidence resulted in a comprehensive picture and actionable local knowledge.

AB This article presents a health promotion initiative in French school settings. This initiative aims to promote children's social, emotional and physical health. The main strategy is the development of teachers' health-promoting practices and schools' health-promoting environment. The initiative was implemented in 115 primary schools in six French regions. Three types of evidence were used to develop the initiative: scientific, professional contextual, and critical evidence. The evidence was translated into the programme through a training and support process. According to their position, the actors used the evidence differently. The importance of the local context and actors' involvement is further explored.

AB Actionable reminders (electronic reminders linked to computerized order entry) might improve care by facilitating direct ordering of recommended tests. The authors implemented four enhanced actionable reminders targeting performance of annual mammography, one-time bone-density screening, and diabetic testing. There was no difference in rates of appropriate testing between the four intervention and four matched, control primary care clinics for screening mammography (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02), bone-density exams (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.02), HbA1c monitoring (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.42) and LDL cholesterol monitoring (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.59). Of the survey respondents, 79% almost never used the system or were unaware of the functionality. In the 9/228 (3.9%) cases with indirect evidence of mammography reminder use, there was a significantly lower proportion with test performance. Our actionable reminders did not improve receipt of overdue testing, potentially due to limitations of workflow integration.

AB The health literacy demands of the healthcare system often exceed the health literacy skills of Americans. This article reviews the development of the Health Literacy Universal Precautions (HLUP) Toolkit, commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and designed to help primary care practices structure the delivery of care as if every patient may have limited health literacy. The development of the toolkit spanned 2 years and consisted of 3 major tasks: (1) developing individual tools (modules explaining how to use or implement a strategy to minimize the effects of low health literacy), using existing health literacy resources when possible, (2) testing individual tools in clinical practice and assembling them into a prototype toolkit, and (3) testing the prototype toolkit in clinical practice. Testing revealed that practices will use tools that are concise and actionable and are not perceived as being resource intensive. Conducting practice self-assessments and generating enthusiasm among staff were key elements for successful implementation. Implementing practice changes required more time than anticipated and some knowledge of quality improvement techniques. In sum, the HLUP Toolkit holds promise as a means of improving primary care for people with limited health literacy, but further testing is needed. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the roles community members can and should play in, and an asset-based strategy used by Chicago's South Side Health and Vitality Studies for, building sustainable, large-scale community health research infrastructure. The Studies are a family of research efforts aiming to produce actionable knowledge to inform health policy, programming, and investments for the region.; METHODS: Community and university collaborators, using a consensus-based approach, developed shared theoretical perspectives, guiding principles, and a model for collaboration in 2008, which were used to inform an asset-based operational strategy. Ongoing community engagement and relationship-building support the infrastructure and research activities of the studies.; RESULTS: Key steps in the asset-based strategy include: 1) continuous community engagement and relationship building, 2) identifying community priorities, 3) identifying community assets, 4) leveraging assets, 5) conducting research, 6) sharing knowledge and 7) informing action. Examples of community member roles, and how these are informed by the Studies' guiding principles, are provided.; CONCLUSIONS: Community and university collaborators, with shared vision and principles, can effectively work together to plan innovative, large-scale community-based research that serves community needs and priorities. Sustainable, effective models are needed to realize NIH's mandate for meaningful translation of biomedical discovery into improved population health. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Zoonotic infections pose a significant public health challenge for low- and middle-income countries and have traditionally been a neglected area of research. The Roadmap to Combat Zoonoses in India (RCZI) initiative conducted an exercise to systematically identify and prioritize research options needed to control zoonoses in India.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: Priority setting methods developed by the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative were adapted for the diversity of sectors, disciplines, diseases and populations relevant for zoonoses in India. A multidisciplinary group of experts identified priority zoonotic diseases and knowledge gaps and proposed research options to address key knowledge gaps within the next five years. Each option was scored using predefined criteria by another group of experts. The scores were weighted using relative ranks among the criteria based upon the feedback of a larger reference group. We categorized each research option by type of research, disease targeted, factorials, and level of collaboration required. We analysed the research options by tabulating them along these categories. Seventeen experts generated four universal research themes and 103 specific research options, the majority of which required a high to medium level of collaboration across sectors. Research options designated as pertaining to 'social, political and economic' factorials predominated and scored higher than options focussing on ecological, genetic and biological, or environmental factors. Research options related to 'health policy and systems' scored highest while those related to 'research for development of new interventions' scored the lowest.; CONCLUSIONS: We methodically identified research themes and specific research options incorporating perspectives of a diverse group of stakeholders. These outputs reflect the diverse nature of challenges posed by zoonoses and should be acceptable across diseases, disciplines, and sectors. The identified research options capture the need for 'actionable research' for advancing the prevention and control of zoonoses in India.

AB PURPOSE: Recent genome wide-association studies have identified hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with common complex diseases. With the momentum of these discoveries comes a need to communicate this information to individuals.; METHODS: The Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative is an observational research study designed to evaluate the utility of personalized genomic information in health care. Participants provide saliva samples for genotyping and complete extensive on-line medical history, family history, and lifestyle questionnaires. Only results for diseases deemed potentially actionable by an independent advisory board are reported.; RESULTS: We present our methodology for developing personalized reports containing risks for both genetic and nongenetic factors. Risk estimates are given as relative risk, derived or reported from representative peer-reviewed publications. Estimates of disease prevalence are also provided. Presenting risk as relative risk allows for consistent reporting across multiple diseases and across genetic and nongenetic factors. Using this approach eliminates the need for assumptions regarding population lifetime risk estimates. Publications used for risk reporting are selected based on the strength of the design and study quality.; CONCLUSION: Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative risk reports demonstrate an approach to communicating risk of complex disease via the web that encompasses risks due to genetic variants along with risks caused by family history and lifestyle factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To increase the number and quality of injury prevention recommendations made by Washington State (USA) child death review teams.; DESIGN: Before and after study design involving four intervention teams and 21 comparison teams.; METHODS: Intervention teams received injury prevention training, collaborative process improvement coaching, and access to web based prevention resources. An equal number of randomly selected child death review case reports filed with the state before the intervention by the intervention and comparison teams were included in the baseline sample. All reports submitted by the intervention and comparison teams after the intervention were included in the follow-up sample. Reports were scored on the completeness of prevention related data elements and on the quality of written prevention recommendations.; RESULTS: Data completion for prevention relevant items increased in intervention teams from 73% at baseline to 88% at follow-up. In comparison teams, this measure fell from 77% to 56% over the same period. The quality of written recommendations produced by intervention teams increased from 4.3 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.1) to 7.6 (95% CI 6.7 to 8.5), while comparison teams showed no significant change (4.0 (95% CI 2.5 to 5.3) to 3.7 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.2)). Specifically, improvements were noted in the identification of evidence based best practices and the development of clear, actionable written recommendations.; CONCLUSION: Injury prevention recommendations are generated in the systematic local review of child deaths. This process can be analysed, measured, supported, and improved.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of a multi-institution quality improvement collaborative to improve patient-nurse relationship quality.; BACKGROUND: Patient-nurse relationships provide the foundation for nursing services and are linked to patient outcomes. Measuring the quality of these relationships is important for ongoing practice changes.; METHODS: A prospective evaluation approach was used. Patients from 12 hospitals in 4 distinct areas of the United States comprised the sample.; RESULTS: All 12 hospitals submitted patient data on a quarterly basis, yielding a reliable database for performance improvement. The Caring Assessment Tool (CAT) performed well, and individual hospitals used the results to improve their performance. Inconsistencies in labeling, differing sample sizes, and administrative burden limited the results.; CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients were willing to provide feedback about their care during hospitalization and multiple institutions successfully participated in the project. An electronic version of the CAT with real-time analysis would decrease burden and provide more timely and accurate results for actionable practice changes.

AB As long as health communications have existed in the USA, Americans have faced the task of sorting the agenda of the source from the advice it provides. That task has become more complicated as advances in the science of nutrition and the technology used to present it have heightened the complexity of nutrition communications. Getting consumers to adopt a healthier diet has been a protracted undertaking with limited successes along the way. The obesity epidemic has added urgency to this discourse: not only do we need to eat better, but most of us also need to eat less. This paper reviews the dynamics that have made the communication of accurate and actionable health behaviour information an ongoing challenge, and outlines strategies for moving ahead. It considers the interplay of four sets of factors: the evolutionary nature of the science on which recommendations are based; the many sources of communication about that science; the agendas or motivations of each source; and finally the multifaceted nature of consumers, the recipients of these communications. Communication alone has not been, and will not be, sufficient for consumers to adopt the behavioural changes endorsed by experts. Broad environmental interventions coupled with individual skills development will need to be part of the process. Ultimately, it is the consumer who decides what is for dinner. Media literacy will play a critical role in building consumer efficacy in sorting fact from fiction in order to select food for a healthful diet.

The discussion emphasizes successful programs and models of service delivery and highlights the limitations of current, fragmented health care system components in supporting effective, efficient, and sustained patient engagement across a continuum of care. A fundamental need exists for improved synergies between funding and service agencies that provide HIV testing, prevention, treatment, and supportive services. We propose a feedback loop whereby actionable, patient-level surveillance of HIV testing and engagement in care activities inform educational outreach and resource allocation to support integrated "testing and linkage to care plus" service delivery. Ongoing surveillance of programmatic performance in achieving defined benchmarks for linkage of patients who have newly diagnosed HIV infection and retention of those patients in care is imperative to iteratively inform further educational efforts, resource allocation, and refinement of service delivery.

AB As health care delivery becomes increasingly focused on patient-centered models, interventions such as patient navigation that have the potential to improve care coordination garner interest from health care managers and clinicians. The ability to understand how and to what extent patient navigation is successful in addressing coordination issues, however, is hampered by multiple definitions, vague boundaries, and different contextual implementations of patient navigation. Using a systematic review strategy and classification method, we review both the conceptual and empirical literature regarding navigation in multiple clinical contexts. We then describe and conceptualize variation in how patient navigation has been defined, implemented, and theorized to affect outcomes. This review suggests that patient navigation varies along multiple dimensions and that the variation is related to differing resources, constraints, and goals. We propose a conceptual model to frame further research and suggest that research in this area must carefully account for this variation in order to accurately assess the benefits of patient navigation and provide actionable knowledge for managers.

AB Developing effective methods to enable the practice of personalized medicine is a national priority for translational science. By leveraging modern genotyping technology and health information technologies, prescribing therapies based on genotype becomes an achievable goal. Within this manuscript, we describe the development, implementation, and piloting of a surveillance tool to assure the quality of clinical decision making in the context of new pharmacogenetic information. The surveillance tool allows a quality assurance (QA) team to review significant genotyping results and deliver focused educational interventions to providers. We report on the first eight patients undergoing genotyping to support antiplatelet therapy selection after drug-eluting stent placement. The collected pilot data supports an informatics approach to QA process management, as our tool delivered actionable patient information. It also enabled providers to tailor antiplatelet therapy to individual patients' genotypes. Our expectation is to continue collecting surveillance reports to perform an in-depth analysis of our tool.

AB The essential purpose of public health surveillance is to monitor important health outcomes and risk factors and provide actionable information to practitioners, policy makers, researchers, and the public to prevent or ameliorate exposure, disease, and death. Although separate 1970s-era acts of Congress made possible the creation of modern occupational health and environmental public health surveillance, these acts also led to fragmented responsibilities and unconnected data across federal agencies. Having a well-defined purpose for systematically collecting relevant data is key, and state and local programs play a crucial role in conducting meaningful surveillance and connecting it with evidence-based outreach and interventions. Congress has directed monies to environmental public health surveillance and capacity has improved, yet no analagous funding has occurred to address the fragmentation found within occupational health surveillance. This article provides a review of the advances and important themes within occupational health and environmental public health surveillance over the past decade.

AB BACKGROUND: Computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems have been shown to improve quality of care and workflow efficiency, and health care reform legislation relies on electronic health records and CDS systems to improve the cost and quality of health care in the United States; however, the heterogeneity of CDS content and infrastructure of CDS systems across sites is not well known.; OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the scope of CDS content in diabetes care at six sites, assess the capabilities of CDS in use at these sites, characterize the scope of CDS infrastructure at these sites, and determine how the sites use CDS beyond individual patient care in order to identify characteristics of CDS systems and content that have been successfully implemented in diabetes care.; METHODS: We compared CDS systems in six collaborating sites of the Clinical Decision Support Consortium. We gathered CDS content on care for patients with diabetes mellitus and surveyed institutions on characteristics of their site, the infrastructure of CDS at these sites, and the capabilities of CDS at these sites.; RESULTS: The approach to CDS and the characteristics of CDS content varied among sites. Some commonalities included providing customizability by role or user, applying sophisticated exclusion criteria, and using CDS automatically at the time of decision-making. Many messages were actionable recommendations. Most sites had monitoring rules (e.g. assessing hemoglobin A1c), but few had rules to diagnose diabetes or suggest specific treatments. All sites had numerous prevention rules including reminders for providing eye examinations, influenza vaccines, lipid screenings, nephropathy screenings, and pneumococcal vaccines.; CONCLUSION: Computer-based CDS systems vary widely across sites in content and scope, but both institution-created and purchased systems had many similar features and functionality, such as integration of alerts and reminders into the decision-making workflow of the provider and providing messages that are actionable recommendations.

Following guidelines from real-world and utilization-focused evaluation frameworks, four projects are described to illustrate one foundation's pragmatic approach to evaluation that values collaboration, methodological appropriateness, and utilization. The authors contend that such an approach helps to ensure meaningful and actionable results in child welfare because it is responsive to local agency information and capacity needs while simultaneously contributing to the knowledge base of the field.

AB Meaningful translation of dementia research findings from the bench to the bedside is dependent on the quality of the knowledge to transfer and the availability and skills of investigators engaged in the knowledge translation process. Although there is no shortage of research on dementia, the latter has been more challenging. Results from a survey of 173 researchers from across Canada suggest that workshops and self-paced online training in dementia knowledge translation are needed to bridge the research-to-practice gap. Sharing information among professionals and with the public and formulating actionable messages to policy makers are primary goals.

AB Healthcare delivery is evolving from individual, autonomous practice to collaborative team practice. However, barriers such as professional autonomy, time constraints and the perception of error as failure preclude learning behaviours that can facilitate organizational learning and improvement. Although experimentation, engaging in questions and feedback, discussing errors and reflecting on results can facilitate learning and promote effective performance, the cultural barriers within healthcare can prevent or inhibit this type of behaviour among teams. At the University Health Network's Centre for Innovation in Complex Care, we realize the need for a tool that facilitates learning behaviour and is sensitive to the risk-averse nature of the clinical environment. The vehicle for the Team Feedback Tool is a web-based application called Rypple (www.rypple.com), which allows team members to provide anonymous, rapid-fire feedback on team processes and performance. Rypple facilitates communication, elicits feedback and provokes discussion. The process enables follow-up face-to-face team discussions and encourages teams to create actionable solutions for incremental changes to enhance team health and performance. The Team Feedback Tool was implemented and piloted in general internal medicine at the University Health Network's Toronto General Hospital from early May 2009 to July 2009 to address the issues of teamwork and learning behaviour in the clinical environment. This article explores the opportunities and barriers associated with the implementation of the Team Feedback Tool.

AB PURPOSE: Customer satisfaction's importance is well-documented in the marketing literature and is rapidly gaining wide acceptance in the healthcare industry. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new customer-satisfaction measuring method - Reichheld's ultimate question - and compare it with traditional techniques using data gathered from four healthcare clinics.; DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A new survey method, called the ultimate question, was used to collect patient satisfaction data. It was subsequently compared with the data collected via an existing method.; FINDINGS: Findings suggest that the ultimate question provides similar ratings to existing models at lower costs.; RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: A relatively small sample size may affect the generalizability of the results; it is also possible that potential spill-over effects exist owing to two patient satisfaction surveys administered at the same time.; PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This new ultimate question method greatly improves the process and ease with which hospital or clinic administrators are able to collect patient (as well as staff and physician) satisfaction data in healthcare settings. Also, the feedback gained from this method is actionable and can be used to make strategic improvements that will impact business and ultimately increase profitability.; ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper's real value is pinpointing specific quality improvement areas based not just on patient ratings but also physician and staff satisfaction, which often underlie patients' clinical experiences.

AB Given the interconnected nature of our world today, emerging pathogens and pandemic outbreaks are an ever-growing threat to the health and economic stability of the global community. This is evident by the recent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the SARS outbreak, as well as the ever-present threat of global bioterrorism. Fortunately, the biomedical community has been able to rapidly generate sequence data so these pathogens can be readily identified. To date, however, the utilization of this sequence data to rapidly produce relevant experimental results or actionable treatments is lagging in spite of obtained sequence data. Thus, a pathogenic threat that has emerged and/or developed into a pandemic can be rapidly identified; however, translating this identification into a targeted therapeutic or treatment that is rapidly available has not yet materialized. This commentary suggests that the growing technology of DNA synthesis should be fully implemented as a means to rapidly generate in vivo data and possibly actionable therapeutics soon after sequence data becomes available.

AB INTRODUCTION: The increasing availability of whole slide imaging (WSI) data sets (digital slides) from glass slides offers new opportunities for the development of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) algorithms. With the all-digital pathology workflow that these data sets will enable in the near future, literally millions of digital slides will be generated and stored. Consequently, the field in general and pathologists, specifically, will need tools to help extract actionable information from this new and vast collective repository.; METHODS: To address this limitation, we designed and implemented a tool (dCORE) to enable the systematic capture of image tiles with constrained size and resolution that contain desired histopathologic features.; RESULTS: In this communication, we describe a user-friendly tool that will enable pathologists to mine digital slides archives to create image microarrays (IMAs). IMAs are to digital slides as tissue microarrays (TMAs) are to cell blocks. Thus, a single digital slide could be transformed into an array of hundreds to thousands of high quality digital images, with each containing key diagnostic morphologies and appropriate controls. Current manual digital image cut-and-paste methods that allow for the creation of a grid of images (such as an IMA) of matching resolutions are tedious.; CONCLUSION: The ability to create IMAs representing hundreds to thousands of vetted morphologic features has numerous applications in education, proficiency testing, consensus case review, and research. Lastly, in a manner analogous to the way conventional TMA technology has significantly accelerated in situ studies of tissue specimens use of IMAs has similar potential to significantly accelerate CAD algorithm development.

AB Public health agencies including federal, state, and local governments routinely send out public health advisories and alerts via e-mail and text messages to health care providers to increase awareness of public health events and situations. Agencies must ensure that practitioners have timely and accessible information at the critical point-of-care. Electronic health record (EHR) systems have the potential to alert physicians of emerging health conditions deemed important for public health at the most critical time of need. To understand how public health agencies can leverage existing alerting mechanisms in EHR systems, it is important to understand characteristics of public health alerts to determine their suitability for alerting in EHR systems. Authors conducted a review and analysis of public health alerts for a 3-year period to identify critical data attributes necessary to support public health alerting in EHR systems. The alerts were restricted to those most relevant for clinical care. The results showed that there is an opportunity for disseminating actionable information to clinical practitioners at the point of care to guide care and reporting. Public health alerts in EHR systems can be useful in reporting, recommending specific tests, as well as suggesting secondary prevention.

AB Cough continues to be one of the top reasons why patients seek medical attention from health care providers. The prescription antitussive market is dominated by opioids, such as codeine that produces inconsistent efficacy and is often accompanied by significant side effect liabilities. Consequently, cough represents an unmet medical need and an underserved market. Yet, against the backdrop of increasing cough research, the development of novel treatments has been exceptionally challenging with dextromethorphan being the last US drug approved for cough almost a half century ago. We support the position that an unambiguous and actionable 'road map' that clearly delineates the pathway forward for new cough suppressants from basic research to and beyond clinical proof-of-concept studies will be an important aspect for future success of this pharmacological class of drug. Pivotal to the establishment of such a road map will be the review of lessons learned from antitussive agents that have been recently progressed to proof-of-concept trials. In the present commentary, we briefly discuss observations and challenges pertaining to SCH 486757, a selective orally active NOP agonist that has recently advanced to human antitussive testing.

AB Sensor technology, which benefits from high temporal measuring resolution, real-time data transfer and high spatial resolution of sensor data that shows in-field variations, has the potential to provide added value for crop production. The present paper explores how sensors and sensor networks have been utilised in the crop production process and what their added-value and the main bottlenecks are from the perspective of users. The focus is on sensor based applications and on requirements that users pose for them. Literature and two use cases were reviewed and applications were classified according to the crop production process: sensing of growth conditions, fertilising, irrigation, plant protection, harvesting and fleet control. The potential of sensor technology was widely acknowledged along the crop production chain. Users of the sensors require easy-to-use and reliable applications that are actionable in crop production at reasonable costs. The challenges are to develop sensor technology, data interoperability and management tools as well as data and measurement services in a way that requirements can be met, and potential benefits and added value can be realized in the farms in terms of higher yields, improved quality of yields, decreased input costs and production risks, and less work time and load.

AB Social support has long been positively correlated with cardiac outcomes. However, sources of tension surrounding peer-involvement in the period following acute cardiac events are well documented. Informed by a previous study of patient perspectives of peer-involvement in cardiac rehabilitation, this paper draws from the cardiac and computing literature to provide actionable insights into how technology could be designed to promote appropriate peer-involvement and the challenges that may be faced when designing technologies to support the unsupported.

AB OBJECTIVES: To understand why the current telephone-based model of disease management (DM) does not provide cost savings and how DM can be retooled based on the best available evidence to deliver better value.; STUDY DESIGN: Literature review.; METHODS: The published peer-reviewed evaluations of DM and transitional care models from 1990 to 2010 were reviewed. Also examined was the cost-effectiveness literature on the treatment of chronic conditions that are commonly included in DM programs, including heart failure, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and asthma.; RESULTS: First, transitional care models, which have historically been confused with commercial DM programs, can provide credible savings over a short period, rendering them low-hanging fruit for plan sponsors who desire real savings. Second, cost-effectiveness research has shown that the individual activities that constitute contemporary DM programs are not cost saving except for heart failure. Targeting of specific patients and activity combinations based on risk, actionability, treatment and program effectiveness, and costs will be necessary to deliver a cost-saving DM program, combined with an outreach model that brings vendors closer to the patient and physician. Barriers to this evidence-driven approach include resources required, marketability, and business model disruption.; CONCLUSIONS: After a decade of market experimentation with limited success, new thinking is called for in the design of DM programs. A program design that is based on a cost-effectiveness approach, combined with greater program efficacy, will allow for the development of DM programs that are cost saving.

AB BACKGROUND: Indicators of quality of care for children in hospitals in low-income countries have been proposed, but information on their perceived validity and acceptability is lacking.; METHODS: Potential indicators representing structural and process aspects of care for six common conditions were selected from existing, largely qualitative WHO assessment tools and guidelines. We employed the Delphi technique, which combines expert opinion and existing scientific information, to assess their perceived validity and acceptability. Panels of experts, one representing an international panel and one a national (Kenyan) panel, were asked to rate the indicators over 3 rounds and 2 rounds respectively according to a variety of attributes.; RESULTS: Based on a pre-specified consensus criteria most of the indicators presented to the experts were accepted: 112/137(82%) and 94/133(71%) for the international and local panels respectively. For the other indicators there was no consensus; none were rejected. Most indicators were rated highly on link to outcomes, reliability, relevance, actionability and priority but rated more poorly on feasibility of data collection under routine conditions. There was moderate to substantial agreement between the two panels of experts.; CONCLUSIONS: This Delphi study provided evidence for the perceived usefulness of most of a set of measures of quality of hospital care for children proposed for use in low-income countries. However, both international and local experts expressed concerns that data for many process-based indicators may not currently be available. The feasibility of widespread quality assessment and responsiveness of indicators to intervention should be examined as part of continued efforts to improve approaches to informative hospital quality assessment.

AB Mendelian genetics forms the basis for gene-informed risk assessment and management for the patient and family, and should be at the very foundation of 21st century personalization of healthcare. Yet this is an underutilized commodity. Identification and characterization of germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, as causing >90% of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism, heralded the era of evidence-based molecular diagnosis, predictive testing, genetic counseling, gene-informed cancer risk assessment, and preventative medicine. Since then, many syndromic endocrine neoplasias have proven to fall under this clinically utile and actionable model, such as those caused by mutations in RET, VHL, or SDHB-D. The familial risk associated with epithelial (nonmedullary) thyroid carcinoma is among the highest of all solid tumors, yet only a few highly penetrant heritable epithelial thyroid cancer syndrome exist. This is illustrated by Cowden syndrome, a difficult-to-recognize autosomal dominant disorder characterized by breast, thyroid, and other cancers, caused by germline mutations in PTEN, encoding a phosphatase, and minorly, SDHB/SDHD variants. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB The search for improved molecular cancer diagnostics is a challenge for which systems approaches show great promise. As is becoming increasingly clear, cancer is a perpetually-evolving, highly multi-factorial disease. With next generation sequencing providing an ever-increasing amount of high-throughput data, the need for analytical tools that can provide meaningful context is critical. Systems approaches have demonstrated an ability to separate meaningful signal from noise that arises from population heterogeneity, heterogeneity within and across tumors, and multiple sources of technical variation when sufficient sample sizes are obtained and standardized measurement technologies are used. The ability to develop clinically useful molecular cancer diagnostics will be predicated on advancements on two major fronts: 1) more comprehensive and accurate measurements of multiple endpoints, and 2) more sophisticated analytical tools that synthesize high-throughput data into meaningful reflections of cellular states. To this end, systems approaches that have integrated transcriptomic data onto biomolecular networks have shown promise in their ability to classify tumor subtypes, predict clinical progression, and inform treatment options. Ultimately, the success of systems approaches will be measured by their ability to develop molecular cancer diagnostics through distilling complex, systems-wide information into actionable information in the clinic.

AB BACKGROUND: Palliative medicine has made rapid progress in establishing its scientific and clinical legitimacy, yet the evidence base to support clinical practice remains deficient in both the quantity and quality of published studies. Historically, the conduct of research in palliative care populations has been impeded by multiple barriers including health care system fragmentation, small number and size of potential sites for recruitment, vulnerability of the population, perceptions of inappropriateness, ethical concerns, and gate-keeping.; METHODS: A group of experienced investigators with backgrounds in palliative care research convened to consider developing a research cooperative group as a mechanism for generating high-quality evidence on prioritized, clinically relevant topics in palliative care.; RESULTS: The resulting Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC) agreed on a set of core principles: active, interdisciplinary membership; commitment to shared research purposes; heterogeneity of participating sites; development of research capacity in participating sites; standardization of methodologies, such as consenting and data collection/management; agile response to research requests from government, industry, and investigators; focus on translation; education and training of future palliative care researchers; actionable results that can inform clinical practice and policy. Consensus was achieved on a first collaborative study, a randomized clinical trial of statin discontinuation versus continuation in patients with a prognosis of less than 6 months who are taking statins for primary or secondary prevention. This article describes the formation of the PCRC, highlighting processes and decisions taken to optimize the cooperative group's success.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the food consumption patterns of US children aged 2 and 3 years.; DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of data collected in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study 2008 based on a single 24-hour dietary recall collected by telephone.; SUBJECTS: A national random sample of children aged 2 and 3 years (n=1,461).; STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: The percentage of children consuming foods from specific food groups was estimated for the full sample of children aged 2 and 3 years and separately by year of age.; RESULTS: About a third of 2-year-olds and a quarter of 3-year-olds consumed whole milk at least once in a day. About 70% of 2- and 3-year-olds consumed vegetables as a distinct food item at least once in day. French fries and other fried potatoes were the most commonly consumed vegetable. Almost three quarters of children (73%) consumed fruit as a distinct food item at least once in a day, and 59% consumed 100% juice. Fresh fruit was the most commonly consumed type of fruit. About 85% of children consumed some type of sweetened beverage, dessert, sweet, or salty snack in a day. Percentages of children consuming such foods were consistently higher for 3-year-olds than for 2-year-olds.; CONCLUSIONS: Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to expose young children to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and healthier fats, and to limit consumption of low-nutrient, energy-dense foods and beverages. Dietary guidance should stress the fact that children in this age group have high nutrient needs and relatively low energy requirements, leaving little room for such foods. Parents need advice that is specific, practical, and actionable. Copyright © 2010 American Dietetic Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Improving the health of minority patients who have diabetes depends in part on improving quality and reducing disparities in ambulatory care. It has been difficult to measure these components at the level of actionable units.; OBJECTIVE: To measure ambulatory care quality and racial disparities in diabetes care across groups of physicians who care for populations of ambulatory diabetes patients.; RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective cohort analysis using administrative data.; SUBJECTS: Using fee-for-service Medicare claims data from 2003 to 2005, we link patients to their principal ambulatory care physician. The patients are then linked to the hospital where their physicians work or have their patients admitted, creating physician-hospital networks.; MEASURES: Proportion of recommended diabetes testing received by black and nonblack diabetes patients.; RESULTS: Blacks received 70% of recommended care compared with nonblacks who received 76.9% (P < 0.001). However, for black and nonblack patients, variation in the quality of care exceeds the racial gap in treatment. The network-specific performance rates for blacks and nonblacks were highly correlated (r = 0.67, P < 0.001), but 47% of blacks, versus 31% of nonblacks, received care from the third of networks with lowest quality. Physician-hospital networks with higher overall quality, or patients with higher socioeconomic status, were no less likely to exhibit black-white disparities.; CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to measure, benchmark, and monitor the quality of minority care at the level of networks responsible for ambulatory care. Consequently, it should be easier to provide patients with information on network performance and to design policies that improve the quality of minority-serving providers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop quality measures using a consensus-based, multistakeholder process to improve delivery of mental health services within primary healthcare settings.; METHODS: A three-stage consensus model culminating in a two-round, modified Delphi postal survey ranking quality measures according to 'actionability,' relevance and overall importance.; PARTICIPANTS: More than 800 people from all 10 provinces and three territories in Canada participated in the study, representing consumers/advocates, clinicians, academics and government decision-makers from regional, provincial and federal levels. A small group with expertise in First Nations and rural-setting health issues was also included, as well as international experts.; RESULTS: The top overall pan-Canadian measure was 'Education about Depression.' 'Actionability' was a key criterion for many of the top 30 measures. Fifty per cent of these measures focused on three major themes: depression, self-harm and access to a broader spectrum of treatment (such as outreach services and psychotherapy). Additional themes included the need for greater collaboration, respectful treatment of patients and families, and improved evaluation of patients. One-way ANOVA results indicated statistically significant differences (p <0.05) between academics, clinicians, consumers and decision-makers on approximately 5% of quality measure ratings. The majority (85% of the 5%) of these differences involved consumer stakeholders.; CONCLUSION: A small set of specific consensus measures were identified through a rigorous, evidence-informed process. These measures can be used for system-wide changes or at the individual practice level. Although these measures have been developed within a Canadian context, the methodology utilised and the measures selected can be adapted elsewhere.

AB BACKGROUND: Part of delivering quality care means providing it in a timely, efficient manner. Improving the efficiency of care requires measurement. The selection of appropriate indicators that are valid and responsive is crucial to focus improvement initiatives. Indicators of operational efficiency should be conceptually simple, generated in real time, calculated using readily available hospital administrative data, sufficiently granular to reveal detail needed to focus improvement, and correlate with other valid indicators of operational efficiency.; DISCUSSION: In this paper, the authors propose daily discharge rate as a novel real-time metric of hospital operational discharge efficiency and compare it with average length of stay. The authors also suggest the use of control charts as an effective way to present daily discharge rate data to clinicians and managers in real time to prompt actionable improvements in discharge efficiency.; CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that daily discharge rate has the potential to drive timely improvements in the discharge process and warrants consideration and further study by others interested in improving hospital operational efficiency and the delivery of quality care.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to describe the features of prospectively overlooked computer-aided detection (CAD) marks on prior screening digital mammograms for women with breast cancer.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A CAD system embedded in a digital mammography system was prospectively applied to 50,100 screening mammograms between December 2003 and December 2006. Each mammogram was originally interpreted by one of five radiologists using the CAD information. Seventy-five mammogram pairs of prior negative screening mammograms and subsequent mammograms of developed cancers were collected. Visible findings and their actionability were determined by three blinded radiologists. All CAD marks, both true-positive and false-positive, and the number of marked views for the visible findings on prior mammograms were analyzed.; RESULTS: Of the 75 areas where cancer later developed, 61% (46/75) of mammograms had visible findings (21 masses, 17 microcalcifications, and eight masses with microcalcifications). Of these visible findings, 46% (21/46) were determined to be actionable, and 54% (25/46) were underthreshold. The CAD system had correctly depicted 74% (34/46) of the visible findings-52% (11/21) of masses, 94% (16/17) of microcalcifications, and 88% (7/8) of masses with microcalcifications. Actionable findings showed higher CAD sensitivity than did underthreshold findings (90% [19/21] vs 60% [15/25]; p = 0.04) and were more often marked on both views (58% [11/19] vs 27% [4/15]; p = 0.09). The average number of false-positive marks per case was 1.61.; CONCLUSION: On prior screening digital mammograms, the CAD system had correctly marked 74% (34/46) of visible findings and 90% (19/21) of actionable findings. The actionable findings showed significantly higher CAD sensitivity and were marked on both mammographic views more often than the underthreshold findings were.

AB PURPOSE: Community-based diabetes screening is common, but its impact on health outcomes is unclear. Screening protocols may not be standardized nor reflect current clinical practice. A community and clinical team examined the quality and consistency of community-based screening to diagnose hyperglycemic states, and it developed a bilingual screening tool to allow screeners to present accurate, actionable results to participants.; METHODS: The team interviewed providers and community members, analyzed forms and educational materials utilized by screeners, and observed local diabetes screening events. Researchers compared glucose parameters used by screeners to published guidelines and observed fingerstick techniques and protocols for education, referral, and follow-up. Screening was divided into 3 phases: participant assessment before testing, obtainment of a sample, and interpretation of and counsel about results.; RESULTS: There was a general lack of consistency in diabetes screening practices at the 12 screenings attended and among the 11 screeners interviewed. Assessment rarely included evaluation of diabetes risk factors or recent caloric intake. Obtaining a sample through fingersticks often included practices known to cause discomfort and decrease accuracy of glucose measurements. Criteria used to categorize results as "normal" or "abnormal" rarely followed published guidelines for laboratory-measured glucose values and varied significantly between screeners. No organization mentioned prediabetes in screenings. Postscreening consultation protocols varied widely.; CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistencies and inaccuracies in screening practices may limit the quality and relevance of community-based diabetes screenings. The impact of local screenings may be enhanced by using a tool that includes concrete steps and precise guidelines.

AB Statistical assessments of performance are common in industry and for individual scientists, but the use of such measures to assess productivity in scientific organizations has lagged behind. The need for defined performance measures has grown as team science has begun to play a larger role in biomedical research, such as in the area of translational medicine. We used a metric, node degree over time, to measure the change in the rate of collaboration over the past five years within an organization, the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT). The number of collaborative papers and grants roughly doubled over the past five years among investigators within but not outside of ITMAT. Also, collaborations within institutions and departments were more frequent than those between them--an actionable area of improvement.

AB  Personal genome testing is offered via the internet directly to consumers. Most tests that are currently offered use data from genome-wide scans to predict risks for multiple common diseases and traits. The utility of these tests is limited, predominantly because they lack predictive ability and clear benefits for disease prevention that are specific for genetic risk groups. In the near future, personal genome tests will likely be based on whole genome sequencing, but will these technological advances increase the utility of personal genome testing? Whole genome sequencing theoretically provides information about the risks of both monogenic and complex diseases, but the practical utility remains to be demonstrated. The utility of testing depends on the predictive ability of the test, the likelihood of actionable test results, and the options available for the reduction of risks. For monogenic diseases, the likelihood of known mutations will be extremely low in the general population and it will be a challenge to recognize new causal variants among all rare variants that are found using sequencing. For complex diseases, the predictive ability of genetic tests will be mainly restricted by the heritability of the disease, but also by the genetic complexity of the disease etiology, which determines the extent to which the heritability can be understood. Given that numerous genetic and non-genetic risk factors interact in the causation of complex diseases, the predictive ability of genetic models will likely remain modest. Personal genome testing will have minimal benefits for individual consumers unless major breakthroughs are made in the near future.

AB BACKGROUND: Written feedback on professional behaviors is an important part of medical training, but little attention has been paid to the quality of written feedback and its expected impact on learning. A large body of research on feedback suggests that feedback is most beneficial when it is specific, clear, and behavioral. Analysis of feedback comments may reveal opportunities to improve the value of feedback.; METHOD: Using a directed content analysis, the authors coded and analyzed feedback phrases collected as part of a pilot of a developmental multisource feedback program. The authors coded feedback on various dimensions, including valence (positive or negative) and whether feedback was directed at the level of the self or behavioral performance.; RESULTS: Most feedback comments were positive, self-oriented, and lacked actionable information that would make them useful to learners.; CONCLUSIONS: Comments often lack effective feedback characteristics. Opportunities exist to improve the quality of comments provided in multisource feedback.

AB Working with a group of key stakeholders, the authors developed an episode-based resource use measure focused on the use of colonoscopy. This measure is intended to identify differences in health care resource use in a short time frame surrounding the colonoscopy. The ultimate intent in the development of this measure was to pair it with a measure of quality so that both the cost and quality of care can be evaluated together. In initial testing, the authors found the use of general anesthesia with colonoscopy to be associated with higher episode costs. Eventually, when paired with quality measures, it is hoped this measure will provide actionable information for health care payers and providers to more efficiently provide colonoscopy services without compromising quality.

AB OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to profile the health technology assessments (HTAs) produced in Canada and other selected countries and assess their potential to inform policy making about health systems in jurisdictions other than the ones for which they were produced, and to develop and pilot test prototypes for packaging and assessing the relevance of HTAs for health system managers and policy makers.; METHODS: We compiled an inventory of all HTAs that were produced by nine HTA agencies between September 2003 and August 2006; coded the title and abstract of each HTA according to the technologies assessed, methods used, and whether or not context-specific actionable messages were provided; developed a prototype for a structured, decision-relevant HTA summary and for a relevance-assessment form; and pilot-tested the prototypes using semistructured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of Canadian healthcare managers and policy makers.; RESULTS: Our review of the 223 HTAs identified that: (i) 44 HTAs addressed health system arrangements (20 percent); (ii) 205 incorporated a systematic review (92 percent), whereas only 12 incorporated a sociopolitical assessment using explicit methods (5 percent); and (iii) 50 contained context-specific actionable messages (22 percent). Our interviews identified significant support for both the general idea of an HTA summary and the prototype's specific elements, but mixed views about using peer assessments of relevance.; CONCLUSIONS: Those involved in supporting the use of HTAs in policy making about health systems may wish to produce structured decision-relevant summaries for their systematic review-containing HTAs to increase the prospects for their HTAs being used outside the jurisdiction for which they were produced.

AB Humans and other animals express power through open, expansive postures, and they express powerlessness through closed, contractive postures. But can these postures actually cause power? The results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.

AB Coordinated action through partnerships is a core approach in community health promotion to deal with the multidimensionality of today's health and societal issues. The number of partnerships is increasing. However, facilitation and evaluation of partnerships is hampered by the lack and/or nonuse of feasible tools. As a consequence, health promotion through partnerships is not optimally facilitated and evaluated. This article describes the development and piloting of a tool and guidelines to facilitate and evaluate coordinated action in community health promotion. The initial development of the tool was based on relevant literature, a conceptual framework to support social environments for health, and an inventory of existing tools. Appreciative inquiry principles contributed to the formulation of items. The result, a checklist for coordinated action, was further developed and assessed for usability in six different partnerships: a national program, an academic collaborative and four local partnerships. Results of the checklist were cross-checked and discussed with partners. Piloting the checklist resulted in a feasible tool helpful to partnerships because of its ability to generate actionable knowledge. The checklist enables the facilitation and evaluation of community health promotion partnerships that differ in context and level (both local and national), phase of the program and topics addressed. Cross-checking and discussing results with partners and triangulation with interview data increases the reliability of the results of the checklist. Piloting in multiple cases contributes to the checklist's external validity.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of electronic medical records to identify common health care-associated infections (HAIs), including pneumonia, surgical site infections, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), has been proposed to help perform HAI surveillance and guide infection prevention efforts. Increased attention on HAIs has led to public health reporting requirements and a focus on quality improvement activities around HAIs. Traditional surveillance to detect HAIs and focus prevention efforts is labor intensive, and computer algorithms could be useful to screen electronic data and provide actionable information.; METHODS: Seven computer-based decision rules to identify UTIs were compared in a sample of 33,834 admissions to an urban academic health center. These decision rules included combinations of laboratory data, patient clinical data, and administrative data (for example, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes).; RESULTS: Of 33,834 hospital admissions, 3,870 UTIs were identified by at least one of the decision rules. The use of ICD-9 codes alone identified 2,614 UTIs. Laboratory-based definitions identified 2,773 infections, but when the presence of fever was included, only 1,125 UTIs were identified. The estimated sensitivity of ICD-9 codes was 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.5%-58.5%) when compared with a culture- and symptom-based definition. Of the UTIs identified by ICD-9 codes, 167/1,125 (14.8%) also met two urine-culture decision rules.; DISCUSSION: Use of the example of UTI identification shows how different algorithms may be appropriate, depending on the goal of case identification. Electronic surveillance methods may be beneficial for mandatory reporting, process improvement, and economic analysis.

AB The objective of this review is to describe the implementation of human factors principles for the design of alerts in clinical information systems. First, we conduct a review of alarm systems to identify human factors principles that are employed in the design and implementation of alerts. Second, we review the medical informatics literature to provide examples of the implementation of human factors principles in current clinical information systems using alerts to provide medication decision support. Last, we suggest actionable recommendations for delivering effective clinical decision support using alerts. A review of studies from the medical informatics literature suggests that many basic human factors principles are not followed, possibly contributing to the lack of acceptance of alerts in clinical information systems. We evaluate the limitations of current alerting philosophies and provide recommendations for improving acceptance of alerts by incorporating human factors principles in their design.

AB Following a report in April 2009 of the presence of Gymnosporangium yamadae Miyabae ex G. Yamada on crabapple (Malus toringo Siebold) in Wilmington, DE (2), University of Delaware, State of Delaware, and USDA/APHIS PPQ personnel collaborated to confirm and document the pathogen. G. yamadae is the causal agent of Japanese apple rust. The fungus is known from Asia with an aecial state on economically important Malus species and telial state on Juniperus chinensis. During the April 2009 site visit, ornamental J. chinensis were observed near the original crabapples. On May 7, 2009, telial galls were collected from the ornamental J. chinensis at the Wilmington site. The telia were confirmed to be G. yamadae by morphometric analysis and molecular data. The rDNA large subunit (LSU) sequence derived from the collected telial galls (GenBank Accession No. GU058012) was identical to the eight G. yamadae LSU sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. FJ848760-FJ848765, FJ559373, and FJ559375) reported from Korea by Yun et al. (3). Teliospores were 45 to 54 mum long with pedicels that were wide (7.0 to 8.4 mum) along the full length. The G. yamadae telial gall collected from Wilmington, DE was deposited into the U.S. National Fungus Collection (BPI 879273). Leaves of M. domestica on the University of Delaware farm in Newark were confirmed to have Japanese apple rust on Aug 4, 2009. Identification was made on the morphological presence of unique roestelioid aecia with long cornulated peridia that lacerate along the sides. The aecia differ from those of G. juniperi-virginianae, the causal agent of cedar apple rust, which has aecial peridia that fimbriate to the base and are strongly recurved (1). Following release of a USDA Pest Alert, subsequent samples submitted to USDA/APHIS PPQ indicated widespread incidence of the G. yamadae aecial state in the northeast, including Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Japanese apple rust likely went undetected for several years because of similar symptomatology to cedar apple rust. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the telial stage of G. yamadae in North America and the first report of this pathogen on Malus domestica in the United States. Knowledge of the geographic distribution of G. yamadae is of significance because of the actionable regulatory status of the pathogen and its potential impact on ornamental and fruit growers of Malus spp. in the United States.

AB Mounting evidence suggests that there is frequently considerable variation in the risk of the outcome of interest in clinical trial populations. These differences in risk will often cause clinically important heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE) across the trial population, such that the balance between treatment risks and benefits may differ substantially between large identifiable patient subgroups; the "average" benefit observed in the summary result may even be non-representative of the treatment effect for a typical patient in the trial. Conventional subgroup analyses, which examine whether specific patient characteristics modify the effects of treatment, are usually unable to detect even large variations in treatment benefit (and harm) across risk groups because they do not account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the likelihood of treatment benefit. Based upon recent evidence on optimal statistical approaches to assessing HTE, we propose a framework that prioritizes the analysis and reporting of multivariate risk-based HTE and suggests that other subgroup analyses should be explicitly labeled either as primary subgroup analyses (well-motivated by prior evidence and intended to produce clinically actionable results) or secondary (exploratory) subgroup analyses (performed to inform future research). A standardized and transparent approach to HTE assessment and reporting could substantially improve clinical trial utility and interpretability.

AB BACKGROUND: Americans are generally favorable towards cancer screening, but fatalistic about cancer prevention. News coverage shapes perceptions of cancer control in meaningful ways, but there is little consensus as to the impact of news on our understanding of and engagement in cancer screening practices. Our analysis of cancer screening-related print news coverage during a four month period in 2005 suggests that the newsworthiness of new screening technologies may undermine public confidence in currently available and effective secondary prevention programs, while promoting tests whose effectiveness is debated or not yet established.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a structured text analysis of 517 cancer-related news articles from 15 leading daily newspapers and a subsequent qualitative analysis of the 79 screening news articles. Screening articles were analyzed for content related to criteria for screening effectiveness. Content patterns for each type of screening and cancer were also noted. News coverage consistently conveyed screening as important and highlighted the need to protect and expand access to screening. At the same time, to the extent that story content was framed by the newsworthiness of new tests and technologies this often indirectly called into question effective and established protocols and programs without providing any actionable alternative.; CONCLUSION: This analysis revealed unexpected messages about screening that are potentially problematic for cancer control. The cancer control community should continue efforts to understand and shape news coverage of screening in order to promote balanced and action-oriented content. Research has shown that Americans hold conflicting views regarding cancer-having a favorable opinion of screening while simultaneously feeling fatalistic about prevention. Our analysis of print news stories on cancer screening suggests that the determination of screening's "newsworthiness" is related to newly developed tests and protocols, which may create demand for new tests whose effectiveness is unknown and undermine confidence in established and effective screening programs.

AB There have been several publications recently that reported DNA sequence alterations in human tumors. There are gene deletions, amplifications, point mutations, translocations, and other genome changes in these samples compared to normal controls. There is also considerable variation in the number of such changes seen in different cancers. Some of the changes particularly those that are mutations in genes driving cellular proliferation will be useful clinically and could be used to monitor disease. At the present time, however, there are more cost effective ways than whole genome sequencing to derive "clinically actionable information" from the molecular analysis of patients and their tumors when they come into the clinic. The number of clinical options available for patients stratified by molecular diagnostics may actually be limited more by the specific treatments available rather than by the ability to stratify the patients in the first place.

AB BACKGROUND: Monitoring implantable cardiac device function and patient condition is important. The Lumos-T Safely Reduces Routine Office Device Follow-Up (TRUST) trial tested the hypothesis that remote home monitoring with automatic daily surveillance (HM) is safe and effective for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator follow-up for 1 year and enables rapid physician evaluation of significant events.; METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 1339 patients were randomized 2:1 to HM or conventional follow-up. Follow-up checks occurred at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months after implantation. HM was used before office visits at 3 and 15 months in the HM group. At 6, 9, and 12 months, HM only was used but was followed by office visits if necessary. Conventional patients were evaluated with office visits only. Scheduled office visits and unscheduled evaluations, incidence of morbidity, and time elapsed from first event occurrence in each patient to physician evaluation were tracked for each group. HM and conventional patients were similar (age, 63.3+/-12.8 versus 64.0+/-12.1 years; gender, 72.0% versus 73.1% male; New York Heart Association class II, 55.9% versus 60.4%; pathology: left ventricular ejection fraction, 29.0+/-10.7% versus 28.5+/-9.8%; coronary artery disease, 64.8% versus 71.7%; primary prevention indication, 72.2% versus 73.8%; and dual-chamber implants, 57.8% versus 56.6%). HM reduced total in-hospital device evaluations by 45% without affecting morbidity. In the HM group, 85.8% of all 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups were performed remotely only, indicating that HM provided sufficient assessment in the majority. Median time to evaluation was <2 days in the HM group compared with 36 days in the conventional group (P<0.001) for all arrhythmic events.; CONCLUSIONS: HM is safe and allows more rapid detection of actionable events compared with conventional monitoring in patients with implantable electronic cardiac devices.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite indoor home environments being where people spend most time, involving residents in testing those environments has been very limited, especially in marginalized communities. We piloted participatory testing and reporting that combined relatively simple tests with actionable reporting to empower residents in Main South/Piedmont neighborhoods of Worcester, Massachusetts. We answered: 1) How do we design and implement the approach for neighborhood and household environments using participatory methods? 2) What do pilot tests reveal? 3) How does our experience inform testing practice?; METHODS: The approach was designed and implemented with community partners using community-based participatory research. Residents and researchers tested fourteen homes for: lead in dust indoors, soil outdoors, paint indoors and drinking water; radon in basement air; PM2.5 in indoor air; mold spores in indoor/outdoor air; and drinking water quality. Monitoring of neighborhood particulates by residents and researchers used real-time data to stimulate dialogue.; RESULTS: Given the newness of our partnership and unforeseen conflicts, we achieved moderate-high success overall based on process and outcome criteria: methods, test results, reporting, lessons learned. The conflict burden we experienced may be attributable less to generic university-community differences in interests/culture, and more to territoriality and interpersonal issues. Lead-in-paint touch-swab results were poor proxies for lead-in-dust. Of eight units tested in summer, three had very high lead-in-dust (>1000 microg/ft2), six exceeded at least one USEPA standard for lead-in-dust and/or soil. Tap water tests showed no significant exposures. Monitoring of neighborhood particulates raised awareness of environmental health risks, especially asthma.; CONCLUSIONS: Timely reporting back home-toxics' results to residents is ethical but it must be empowering. Future work should fund the active participation of a few motivated residents as representatives of the target population. Although difficult and demanding in time and effort, the approach can educate residents and inform exposure assessment. It should be considered as a core ingredient of comprehensive household toxics' testing, and has potential to improve participant retention and the overall positive impact of long-term environmental health research efforts.

AB AIM OF THE STUDY: Although patient and tumour characteristics are the most important determinants for outcomes in rectal cancer care, actionable factors for improving these are still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of surgeon and hospital factors which can actually be influenced to improve on postoperative complications, disease-free survival (DFS) and relative survival (RS) in rectal cancer.; METHODS: For 819 curatively operated rectal cancer patients, staged I-III and diagnosed between 2001 and 2005, data were derived from the population-based Cancer Registry of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre North East and supplemented by medical record examination. (Multilevel) Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the influence of relevant factors on postoperative complications and time from diagnosis to first treatment. Besides, Cox regression analysis for DFS and relative survival analysis was performed.; RESULTS: Postoperative complications were dependent on type of surgery (p=0.024) and hospital volume (p=0.029). DFS was mainly influenced by stage (p<0.001) and time to treatment (p=0.018). Actionable indicators related to RS were type of surgery (p=0.011) and time to treatment (p=0.048). Time to treatment was found to be related to co-morbidity (p=0.007), preoperative radiotherapy (p=0.003) and referral for operation (p=0.048). Nevertheless, 18.2% unexplained variation in time to treatment remained on hospital level.; CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that optimal outcomes for rectal cancer care can be achieved by focusing on early detection and timely diagnosis, as well as adequate choice and timeliness of treatment in hospitals with optimal logistics for rectal cancer patients.

AB Advances in genomics and proteomics promise to transform biomarker research, in which the major challenges will not be the discovery of new markers but rather the optimal selection and validation of a subgroup of clinically useful markers from the large pool of candidates. Critically, the value of new biomarkers panels will need to be assessed in the context of readily available clinical information in order to create more actionable knowledge rather than just greater complexity. Appropriate methodologies for the clinical and statistical evaluation of so called "multi-marker strategies" have not been systematically defined. Although specific criteria for the appropriate clinical and statistical evaluation of multi-marker strategies will vary based on the intended use (e.g., diagnosis vs. screening), the ultimate measure of success is the ability for a biomarker panel to both correct a meaningful portion of misclassification by standard methods (discrimination) and to improve quantification of absolute risk (calibration) in comparison to existing clinical information. Findings should be validated in an independent dataset of the representative patient population before a given multi-marker strategy can be considered for clinical use. Here, we define multi-marker strategies, summarize recent examples of biomarker combinations in heart failure, address key statistical and clinical issues, and discuss future directions for this rapidly evolving field.

AB The identification of germline high penetrance gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene as causative of multiple endocrine neoplasia led to accurate molecular diagnosis, predictive testing and gene-informed preventative medicine. Many syndromic endocrine neoplasias fell under this clinically utile model, although not all endocrine neoplasias were accounted for by these high penetrance predisposition genes associated with the validated practice of clinical cancer genetics. The past decade has seen the identification of low penetrance alleles for various endocrine neoplasias, including medullary and epithelial thyroid carcinomas and isolated pituitary adenomas. Functional characterisation of these effects, which range from subtle expressional or micro-RNA regulation, and the analysis of the conferred risks, which are typically low and below the threshold for medical actionability, remain scientific challenges before these may be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

AB BACKGROUND: An important challenge facing the research community is how to make comparative effectiveness reviews "fit for purpose"--how to translate the results into a format that can provide actionable guidance for all stakeholders trying to improve the quality and value of health care.; METHODS: To communicate transparently the overall judgments on the findings from a comparative effectiveness review, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) uses an integrated evidence rating that combines separate ratings of comparative clinical effectiveness and comparative value. These integrated ratings look somewhat like bond ratings, and are suited to foster more direct consideration by all decision makers for potential application to patient information, clinical guidelines, and value-based coverage and payment policies.; RESULTS: ICER Integrated Evidence Ratings have supported coverage decision-making processes in a limited number of public and private payers, and demonstration efforts are underway to link reviews to patient information and revised payment policies. Several important challenges to rating have been encountered and addressed. Early feedback has suggested that the rating format helps decision makers understand the key issues underlying judgments about the comparative effectiveness of alternative interventions.; CONCLUSION: Decision makers need comparative effectiveness reviews to be objective and rigorous; they also need key judgments regarding the evidence to be translated so all stakeholders can understand and consider them fully. A rating format that captures key judgments about comparative clinical effectiveness and comparative value could prove an effective method for helping ensure that comparative effectiveness reviews are understandable and useful to all stakeholders.

AB Biomarkers are becoming increasingly available for clinical use, particularly in the care of patients with heart failure. For health care providers, a major difficulty is how to interpret and apply these increasing amounts of diagnostic and prognostic information. Consequently, the scientific challenge is evolving from the discovery of biomarkers to the selection and validation of select panels of clinically useful markers that balance performance and practicality. Optimal combinations of biomarkers will vary based on the intended use (eg, diagnosis vs prognosis). The final goal must be to generate more actionable knowledge that improves patient management and outcomes, rather than merely creating greater complexity. Here we conceptually define multiple biomarker strategies, provide examples of emerging biomarker panels used in the care of patients with heart failure, and address key statistical and clinical issues for this rapidly evolving field.

AB In 2005, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality established the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program. The EHC Program aims to provide understandable and actionable information for patients, clinicians, and policy makers. The Evidence-based Practice Centers are one of the cornerstones of the EHC Program. Three key elements guide the EHC Program and thus, the conduct of Comparative Effectiveness Reviews by the EPC Program. Comparative Effectiveness Reviews introduce several specific challenges in addition to the familiar issues raised in a systematic review or meta-analysis of a single intervention. The articles in this series together form the current Methods Guide for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews of the EHC Program.

AB Modern business science has many tools that can be of great value to radiologists and their practices. One of the most important and underused is long-term planning. Part of the problem has been the pace of change. Making a 5-year plan makes sense only if your develop robust scenarios of possible future conditions you will face. Scenario analysis is one of many highly regarded tools that can improve your predictive capability. However, as with many tools, it pays to have some training and to get practical tips on how to improve their value. It also helps to learn from other people's mistakes rather than your own. The authors discuss both theoretical and practical issues in using scenario analysis to improve your planning process. They discuss actionable ways this set of tools can be applied in a group meeting or retreat. Copyright (c) 2010 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is a dearth of large prospective studies to determine if genetic risk factors are useful predictors of health outcomes and if reporting them to individuals or physicians changes health behavior. The Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (CPMC, NJ, USA) is a prospective observational study with three cohorts - community, cancer and chronic disease cohorts. Participants provide detailed medical history through a dynamic internet-based portal. DNA is tested and personalized risk reports are provided for potentially actionable health conditions. To date, the community cohort has enrolled 4372 participants. The internet-based portal supplies educational content, captures phenotypic data and delivers customized risk reports. The Informed Cohort Oversight Board has approved 16 health conditions to date, and risk reports with genetic and nongenetic risks for six conditions have been released. The majority (87%) of participants who completed requisite questionnaires viewed at least one report. The CPMC is a cohort study delivering customized risk reports for actionable conditions using a web interface and measuring outcomes longitudinally.

AB BACKGROUND: Combat injury patterns differ from civilian trauma in that the former are largely explosion-related, comprising multiple mechanistic and fragment injuries and high-kinetic-energy bullets. Further, unlike civilians, U.S. armed forces combatants are usually heavily protected with helmets and Kevlar body armor with ceramic plate inserts. Searchable databases providing actionable, statistically valid knowledge of body surface entry wounds and resulting organ injury severity are essential to understanding combat trauma.; METHODS: Two tools were developed to address these unique aspects of combat injury: (1) the Surface Wound Mapping (SWM) database and Surface Wound Analysis Tool (SWAT) software that were developed to generate 3D density maps of point-of-surface wound entry and resultant anatomic injury severity; and (2) the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2005-Military that was developed by a panel of military trauma surgeons to account for multiple injury etiology from explosions and other high-kinetic- energy weapons. Combined data from the Joint Theater Trauma Registry, Navy/Marine Combat Trauma Registry, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System Mortality Trauma Registry were coded in AIS 2005-Military, entered into the SWM database, and analyzed for entrance site and wounding path.; RESULTS: When data on 1,151 patients, who had a total of 3,500 surface wounds and 12,889 injuries, were entered into SWM, surface wounds averaged 3.0 per casualty and injuries averaged 11.2 per casualty. Of the 3,500 surface wounds, 2,496 (71%) were entrance wounds with 6,631 (51%) associated internal injuries, with 2.2 entrance wounds and 5.8 associated injuries per casualty (some details cannot be given because of operational security). Crude deaths rates were calculated using Maximum AIS-Military.; CONCLUSION: These new tools have been successfully implemented to describe combat injury, mortality, and distribution of wounds and associated injuries. AIS 2005-Military is a more precise assignment of severity to military injuries. SWM has brought data from all three combat registries together into one analyzable database. SWM and SWAT allow visualization of wounds and associated injuries by region on a 3D model of the body.

AB BACKGROUND: Community-based organizations (CBOs) are important stakeholders in health systems and are increasingly called upon to use research evidence to inform their advocacy, program planning, and service delivery efforts. CBOs increasingly turn to community-based research (CBR) given its participatory focus and emphasis on linking research to action. In order to further facilitate the use of research evidence by CBOs, we have developed a strategy for community-based knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) that helps CBOs more effectively link research evidence to action. We developed the strategy by: outlining the primary characteristics of CBOs and why they are important stakeholders in health systems; describing the concepts and methods for CBR and for KTE; comparing the efforts of CBR to link research evidence to action to those discussed in the KTE literature; and using the comparison to develop a framework for community-based KTE that builds on both the strengths of CBR and existing KTE frameworks.; DISCUSSION: We find that CBR is particularly effective at fostering a climate for using research evidence and producing research evidence relevant to CBOs through community participation. However, CBOs are not always as engaged in activities to link research evidence to action on a larger scale or to evaluate these efforts. Therefore, our strategy for community-based KTE focuses on: an expanded model of 'linkage and exchange' (i.e., producers and users of researchers engaging in a process of asking and answering questions together); a greater emphasis on both producing and disseminating systematic reviews that address topics of interest to CBOs; developing a large-scale evidence service consisting of both 'push' efforts and efforts to facilitate 'pull' that highlight actionable messages from community relevant systematic reviews in a user-friendly way; and rigorous evaluations of efforts for linking research evidence to action.; SUMMARY: Through this type of strategy, use of research evidence for CBO advocacy, program planning, and service delivery efforts can be better facilitated and continually refined through ongoing evaluations of its impact.

AB BACKGROUND: Opioid prescribing for chronic pain is common and controversial, but recommended clinical practices are followed inconsistently in many clinical settings. Strategies for increasing adherence to clinical practice guideline recommendations are needed to increase effectiveness and reduce negative consequences of opioid prescribing in chronic pain patients.; METHODS: Here we describe the process and outcomes of a project to operationalize the 2003 VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain into a computerized decision support system (DSS) to encourage good opioid prescribing practices during primary care visits. We based the DSS on the existing ATHENA-DSS. We used an iterative process of design, testing, and revision of the DSS by a diverse team including guideline authors, medical informatics experts, clinical content experts, and end-users to convert the written clinical practice guideline into a computable algorithm to generate patient-specific recommendations for care based upon existing information in the electronic medical record (EMR), and a set of clinical tools.; RESULTS: The iterative revision process identified numerous and varied problems with the initially designed system despite diverse expert participation in the design process. The process of operationalizing the guideline identified areas in which the guideline was vague, left decisions to clinical judgment, or required clarification of detail to insure safe clinical implementation. The revisions led to workable solutions to problems, defined the limits of the DSS and its utility in clinical practice, improved integration into clinical workflow, and improved the clarity and accuracy of system recommendations and tools.; CONCLUSIONS: Use of this iterative process led to development of a multifunctional DSS that met the approval of the clinical practice guideline authors, content experts, and clinicians involved in testing. The process and experiences described provide a model for development of other DSSs that translate written guidelines into actionable, real-time clinical recommendations.

AB The past 15 years have seen a rapid increase in our understanding of orbitofrontal function. Today this region is the focus of an enormous amount of research, including work on such complex phenomena as regret, ambiguity, and willingness to pay. The orbitofrontal cortex is also credited as a major player in a host of neuropsychiatric diseases. This transformation arguably began with the application of concepts derived from animal learning theory. We will review data from studies emphasizing these approaches to argue that the orbitofrontal cortex forms a crucial part of a network of structures that signals information about expected outcomes. Further we will suggest that, within this network, the orbitofrontal cortex provides the critical ability to integrate information in real-time to make what amounts to actionable predictions or estimates about future outcomes. As we will show, the influence of these estimates can be demonstrated experimentally in appropriate behavioral settings, and their operation can also readily explain the role of orbitofrontal cortex in much more complex phenomena such as those cited above.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is often curable and preventable using current screening modalities. Unfortunately, screening compliance remains low, partly due to patient dissatisfaction with faecal/endoscopic testing. Recent guidelines advise CRC screening should begin with risk stratification. A blood-based test providing clinically actionable CRC risk information would likely improve screening compliance and enhance clinical decision making. We analyzed 196 gene expression profiles to select candidate CRC biomarkers. qRT-PCR was performed on 642 samples to develop a 7-gene biomarker panel using 112 CRC/120 controls (training set) and 202 CRC/208 controls (independent, blind test set). Panel performance characteristics and disease prevalence (0.7%) were then used to develop a scale assessing an individual's current risk of having CRC based on his/her gene signature. A 7-gene panel (ANXA3, CLEC4D, LMNB1, PRRG4, TNFAIP6, VNN1 and IL2RB) discriminated CRC in the training set (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (ROC AUC), 0.80; accuracy, 73%; sensitivity, 82%; specificity 64%). The independent blind test set confirmed performance (ROC AUC, 0.80; accuracy, 71%; sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 70%). Individual gene profiles were compared against the population results and used to calculate the current relative risk for CRC. We have developed a 7-gene, blood-based biomarker panel that can stratify subjects according to their current relative risk across a broad range in an average-risk population. Across the continuous spectrum of risk as defined by the current relative risk scale, it is possible to identify clinically meaningful reference points that can assist patients and physicians in CRC screening decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus continues to result in substantial morbidity and mortality despite receiving much attention from health care providers. Automated clinician reminder systems have been developed to improve adherence to diabetes care guidelines, but these reminder systems do not always provide actionable information and may be unable to detect relevant, subjective patient information that affects clinical decision making. Face-to-face visits with pharmacists, who have knowledge of care guidelines and medication management strategies, may assist in improving diabetes care. It is unknown if the combination of pharmacist chart review and clinician reminders could improve diabetes care without requiring face-to-face visits.; OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a comprehensive, pharmacistdelivered, primary care, physician-focused intervention in a large hospital based primary care practice to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes including rates of semiannual hemoglobin A1c testing and other biomarker and process measures.; METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study conducted in a hospital-based, primary care practice, composed of 37 faculty primary care physicians (PCPs) and 95 internal medicine residents. The initial sample included 346 patients with diabetes and 72 PCPs caring for them. PCPs were randomized to receive either a personalized letter from a practicing pharmacist containing treatment recommendations for patients with upcoming primary care visits (intervention, n = 33) or to usual care without the letters (control, n = 39). The letter included patient-specific recommendations regarding overdue testing as well as drug therapy to achieve diabetes-related treatment targets. The intervention included addition of the letter to the electronic medical record (EMR) and presentation of the letter to the PCP at the time of the index primary care visit that occurred between November 2003 and August 2004. Follow-up chart review was performed after the primary care visit to determine changes in 5 process and 3 biomarker outcome measures of diabetes care within 30 days of the index visit. The primary study outcome was a process measure, change in rates of semiannual A1c testing from baseline to 30-day follow-up. Baseline differences were tested for statistical significance using Pearson chisquare. The statistical significance of the intervention's effect was tested using logistic regression models predicting achievement of each study outcome, with randomization status (intervention vs. control) as the predictor variable of interest, controlling for baseline performance for each measure.; RESULTS: 171 patients were in the 4 medical clinic suites with 33 PCPs who received the intervention, and 175 patients were in the 4 suites with 39 PCPs in usual care. 30-day outcomes were analyzed for 301 patients (87.0%) who attended their scheduled index primary care visit. Of these 301 patients, 44.5% were black, 65.8% were female, and the mean age was 63 years. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the intervention group (n = 150) and the usual care (control) group (n = 151) in the 3 biomarker measures (proportion with A1c less than 7%, proportion with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] less than 100 milligrams per deciliter [mg per dL], or blood pressure less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mm Hg]). There were no significant baseline differences in 4 of the 5 process measures; however, the rate of annual LDL-C testing was significantly higher for the intervention than for the control group at baseline (86.0% vs. 74.8%, respectively, P = 0.015). In logistic regression analysis, rates of semiannual A1c testing were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups, increasing from baseline to follow-up by 16% in the intervention group and 9% in the control group (P = 0.146). The proportion of patients with A1c less than 7% at follow-up was 43.3% in the intervention group versus 37.7% in the control group (intervention effect P = 0.099). The only statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the 8 outcome measures was a higher proportion with an annual eye exam at follow-up in the intervention group (60.0%) versus the usual care group (50.3%, intervention effect P = 0.017).; CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-generated recommendations delivered by letter to PCPs in an academic medical practice were not associated with statistically significant improvements in most quality measures for diabetes care assessed at 30 days following the intervention. Further research is needed with more patients and a longer follow-up time to determine how best to improve the quality of care of patients with diabetes using focused recommendations for therapy changes and reminder notices to clinicians.

AB Specific chromosomal alterations are recognized as important prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Array-based karyotyping is gaining acceptance as an alternative to the standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel for detecting these aberrations. This study explores the optimum single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array probe density for routine clinical use, presents clinical validation results for the 250K Nsp Affymetrix SNP array, and highlights clinically actionable genetic lesions missed by FISH and conventional cytogenetics. CLL samples were processed on low (10K2.0), medium (250K Nsp), and high (SNP6.0) probe density Affymetrix SNP arrays. Break point definition and detection rates for clinically relevant genetic lesions were compared. The 250K Nsp array was subsequently validated for routine clinical use and demonstrated 98.5% concordance with the standard CLL FISH panel. SNP array karyotyping detected genomic complexity and/or acquired uniparental disomy not detected by the FISH panel. In particular, a region of acquired uniparental disomy on 17p was shown to harbor two mutated copies of TP53 that would have gone undetected by FISH, conventional cytogenetics, or array comparative genomic hybridization. SNP array karyotyping allows genome-wide, high resolution detection of copy number and uniparental disomy at genomic regions with established prognostic significance in CLL, detects lesions missed by FISH, and provides insight into gene dosage at these loci.

AB Because of the historic economic crisis, the past 18 months--2008 and the first half of 2009--have been challenging for many plastic surgery practices. Prior to the economic crisis in 2008, many practices enjoyed success with little synchronization between financial and productivity results, practice goals, and strategic planning. Now, suddenly, there is a great deal of interest in the alignment of budgets and financial reporting, marketing return on investment (ROI), staff accountability, and overhead management. The process of developing a business plan can serve to bring clarity and objectivity to the assessment of practice goals and market dynamics. The business planning process also provides assurance of more efficient use of the practice's human and capital resources. Ultimately, the process will bring order, discipline, and focus to practice stakeholders, thus increasing the likelihood of meeting or exceeding practice goals. The process: (1) defining the mission of the practice; (2) completing a competitive analysis for your market; (3) completing an assessment of your current environment; (4) completing an assessment of the financial health of your practice; (5) preparation of a SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis; and (6) a translation of your mission statement into specific long-term goals and short-term performance objectives. The outcome of completing these tasks should be an actionable plan that will serve as a guide or road map for the practice. A well-articulated plan will solidify staff confidence, continue the advancement of a strong business foundation, and provide clear navigation through this new economic landscape in a way that preserves your ability to provide the care you have devoted yourselves to deliver. Today's needs, and yesterday's lessons, dictate that a well-documented strategic action plan be undertaken. Thieme Medical Publishers.

AB UNLABELLED: THE LANDSCAPE: Physician use of handhelds is by no means a new concept. But as the devices--particularly the RIM BlackBerry, Apple iPhone and Google Android--become more sophisticated and more applications become available, the game is changing, quickly. And with so many hospitals upgrading their infrastructures to offer ubiquitous wireless coverage, clinicians are using smartphones in the hospital setting to access online tools such as drug references, and communicate with colleagues. For ClOs, it's a no-brainer--physicians and nurses are already carrying these devices, so why not capitalize on the trend by enabling users to access clinical information and link to patient records. A number of organizations have adopted this thinking and are on the road to enabling EMR access via mobile devices. And while there are certainly sticking points, it's an area that many say is poised for significant growth in the next few years.; THE FUTURE: Many innovative organizations are looking to provide access to electronic records and other clinical data through smartphones. Plans are already being formulated to leverage the devices to facilitate patient handoff and sign-out, as well as to link charge capture with quality measures. Cutting-edge organizations are looking to create actionable information for clinicians through software that can analyze data, track patients'progress, and send out alerts when conditions worsen.

AB Poor routine immunization coverage in India has led to a large burden of vaccine-preventable diseases borne by children under 5 years of age. Despite efforts to strengthen infrastructure and service delivery in the past decade, immunization coverage rates have reached a plateau. To meet the formidable needs of India's growing population and address the shortcomings of health services for rural populations, the country is now turning toward a new national community health worker (CHW) plan. This article reviews the effectiveness of CHWs in expanding immunization coverage in developing countries and examines the potential contribution of CHWs toward strengthening immunization services in rural India. While the limited number and quality of available studies make it difficult to directly compare CHW interventions to other strategies for improving immunization coverage, it is clear that CHWs make diverse contributions toward strengthening immunization programs. Incorporation of evidence-based strategies for CHW selection, retention, and training is critical for success of India's immunization program. In addition, there is growing need to develop efficient mechanisms for monitoring children's vaccination status to generate actionable feedback and identify cost-effective strategies.

AB OBJECTIVE: Creating effective and actionable research has become increasingly important for the health disciplines. Despite greater attention to knowledge translation (KT) in the health research, policy, and professional literature and the mounting need for strategic action to reduce the burden of ill health experienced by Aboriginal people in Canada, little time has been dedicated to understanding KT in Aboriginal health research contexts (Aboriginal KT). The purpose of this study was to explore and discuss the unique qualities of Aboriginal KT.; METHODS: An exploratory case study of the Network Environments for Aboriginal Research British Columbia (NEARBC) was undertaken, in which qualitative interviewing with experts associated with the network was conducted.; RESULTS: Four themes were revealed from the analysis of 10 semi-structured qualitative interviews: 1) Definitional debate, 2) "Aboriginal" KT, 3) Doing KT, and 4) KT roles. These themes highlight the definitional complexity, practical confusion, multidisciplinary nature, and lack of accountability related to Aboriginal KT.; DISCUSSION: The information gained from the study participants adds some important insights to the current literature. It also identifies areas where future discussion may help improve the understanding and meaning of KT in Aboriginal health research contexts, as well as its application in practice. The health disparities of Aboriginal people in Canada are a call for action with regards to KT and this study provides some basic information and advice on ways to move the research and policy agenda forward.

AB Cancer is now appreciated as not only a highly heterogenous pathology with respect to cell type and tissue origin but also as a disease involving dysregulation of multiple pathways governing fundamental cell processes such as death, proliferation, differentiation and migration. Thus, the activities of molecular networks that execute metabolic or cytoskeletal processes, or regulate these by signal transduction, are altered in a complex manner by diverse genetic mutations in concert with the environmental context. A major challenge therefore is how to develop actionable understanding of this multivariate dysregulation, with respect both to how it arises from diverse genetic mutations and to how it may be ameliorated by prospective treatments. While high-throughput experimental platform technologies ranging from genomic sequencing to transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiling are now commonly used for molecular-level characterization of tumor cells and surrounding tissues, the resulting data sets defy straightforward intuitive interpretation with respect to potential therapeutic targets or the effects of perturbation. In this review article, we will discuss how significant advances can be obtained by applying computational modeling approaches to elucidate the pathways most critically involved in tumor formation and progression, impact of particular mutations on pathway operation, consequences of altered cell behavior in tissue environments and effects of molecular therapeutics.

AB As a result of improved hospital information-technology infrastructure and declining costs of storage media, vast amounts of physiological waveform and trend data can now be continuously collected and archived from bedside monitors in operating rooms, intensive care units, or even regular hospital rooms. The real-time or off-line processing of such volumes of high-resolution data, in attempts to turn raw data into clinically actionable information, poses significant challenges. However, it also presents researchers - and eventually clinicians - with unprecedented opportunities to move beyond the traditional individual-channel analysis of waveform data, and towards an integrative patient-monitoring framework, with likely improvements in patient care and safety. We outline some of the challenges and opportunities, and propose strategies for model-based integration of physiological data to improve patient monitoring.

AB AIM: We aimed at developing a prioritized set of quality indicators for schizophrenia care to be used for continuous quality monitoring. They should be evidence-based and rely on routine data.; METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify papers on validated quality indicators published between 1990 to April 2008 in MEDLINE, the Cochrane databases, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Databases of relevant national and international organizations were searched. Indicators were described with respect to meaningfulness, feasibility and actionability. A workshop with relevant stakeholders evaluated the measures through a structured consensus process.; RESULTS: We identified 78 indicators through literature search and selected 22 quality indicators. Furthermore, 12 structural and case-mix indicators were choosen. Only five quality indicators were rated "essential indicators" (priority 1), 14 were rated "additional first choice" (priority 2), and three were rated as "additional second choice" (priority 3). Only four indicators assessed outcome quality. In the majority of indicators the evidence base supporting the indicator recommendation was weak. None of the selected indicators was validated in experimental studies.; CONCLUSIONS: Evidence and validation base played only a subordinate role for indicator prioritisation by stakeholders indicating that there are discrepancies between clinical questions and requirements in schizophrenia care and scientific research.

AB The core philosophy of health information exchanges is to bring together industry stakeholders to facilitate the movement of actionable healthcare information within or across organizations. One workable model for automating the HIE is the virtual health exchange. It allows an organization to satisfy its electronic data exchange needs, while positioning it for HIO/RHIO and Nationwide Health Information Network inclusion. Four healthcare organizations in the San Francisco bay area offer a unique case study of this emerging model and a distinctive technology strategy using HIPAA-compliant SaaS online connectivity. The article will explore the foundational elements such as platform connectivity solutions and services that meet the federal HIT Policy Committee's approved recommendation of "meaningful use" 2011 criteria for exchange health information. Several ambulatory solutions are integrated into the data and workflow. The Bay Area HIE consists of John Muir Health, a private health system; Hill Physicians Medical Group, an independent physicians' organization; Alta Bates Medical Group, a 600-physician IPA; San Ramon Regional Medical Center, a 123-bed, acute-care hospital; and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), a large academic health system. Collectively, 2,800-plus physicians, 900,000 patients, numerous reference labs and interoperability among several health IT vendors are involved. Providers and hospitals are exchanging data and 136,000 patients have connected online to their records. Connected physicians have access to online services, e.g., results management, messaging, colleague-to-colleague messaging, referrals, and eprescribing. Patients are offered secure messaging, including preventive care reminders, PHRs, lab results, script renewals, bill payment, appointment requests, referrals and education services. Revealed are resulting care coordination and practice operational improvements.

AB Systematic evaluation of the introduction and impact of health information systems (HIS) is a challenging task. As the implementation is a dynamic process, with diverse issues emerge at various stages of system introduction, it is challenge to weigh the contribution of various factors and differentiate the critical ones. A conceptual framework will be helpful in guiding the evaluation effort; otherwise data collection may not be comprehensive and accurate. This may again lead to inadequate interpretation of the phenomena under study. Based on comprehensive literature research and own practice of evaluating health information systems, the author proposes a multimethod approach that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative measurement and centered around DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model. This approach aims to quantify the performance of HIS and its impact, and provide comprehensive and accurate explanations about the casual relationships of the different factors. This approach will provide decision makers with accurate and actionable information for improving the performance of the introduced HIS.

AB Information technology in health care (HIT) is getting a major boost in the United States through the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The portion of the Act that relates to health information technology (HITECH) seeks to achieve widespread implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) across the land and assure that these EHRs achieve sufficient levels of 'meaningful use' to improve care, reduce costs, and result in better outcomes. This chapter sets the stage for the other chapters that follow in this section. The chapter will review current thinking about how HIT will facilitate collection, dissemination, and evaluation of information throughout the system. Further, it will discuss the role and potential for HIT to support a learning organization [7,8]. Finally, it will outline the current widely identified barriers to progress, e.g., standards development, lack of interoperability and connectivity, and limited decision support that uses evidence-based guidelines created and maintained explicitly to be actionable through computer-based records and systems. Further, with the passage of HITECH, there is a continued attention given to privacy policy at the expense of access to person-specific health information for legitimate social purposes including research and community health. More will be said about this near the end of the chapter. Finally, the chapter will end with a discussion of the difference between information and communication and it will advocate for greater attention to the use of technology as a tool for improve communications and not simply storage and transmission of information.

AB BACKGROUND: In October 2006, federal funding was announced for the development of a national strategy to fight cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Canada. The comprehensive, independent, stakeholder-driven Canadian Heart Health Strategy and Action Plan (CHHS-AP) was delivered to the Minister of Health on February 24, 2009.; OBJECTIVES: The mandate of CHHS-AP Theme Working Group (TWG) 6 was to identify the optimal chronic disease management model that incorporated timely access to rehabilitation services and end-of-life planning and care. The purpose of the present paper was to provide an overview of worldwide approaches to CVD and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) strategies and recommendations for CR care in Canada, within the context of the well-known Chronic Care Model (CCM). A separate paper will address end-of-life issues in CVD.; METHODS: TWG 6 was composed of content representatives, primary care representatives and patients. Input in the area of Aboriginal and indigenous cardiovascular health was obtained through individual expert consultation. Information germane to the present paper was gathered from international literature and best practice guidelines. The CCM principles were discussed and agreed on by all. Prioritization of recommendations and overall messaging was discussed and decided on within the entire TWG. The full TWG report was presented to the CHHS-AP Steering Committee and was used to inform the recommendations of the CHHS-AP.; RESULTS: Specific actionable recommendations for CR are made in accordance with the key principles of the CCM.; CONCLUSIONS: The present CR blueprint, as part of the CHHS-AP, will be a first step toward reducing the health care burden of CVD in Canada.

AB OBJECTIVES: The industry perspective on drug costs should be framed by the need for decision-makers to use actual and relevant costs, and to inform real-world decisions regarding medication selection and use. The objective of this report is to provide guidance and recommendations on how manufacturers should approach the use of drug costs.; METHODS: The Task Force was appointed with the advice and consent of the ISPOR Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of drug cost information working in academia and industry, and came from several countries. Following the core assumptions developed and outlined by the Task Force, a draft report was prepared. Comments were solicited on the outline and several draft reports both from a core group of external reviewers and more broadly from the ISPOR membership of ISPOR via the ISPOR Web site.; RESULTS: The industry should always strive for: 1) a focus on drug value and not just cost; 2) credibility-that is correct and consistent costs; 3) transparency-by disclosing the prices and costs, and ensuring that they reflect the actual cost of the drug whenever possible; and 4) providing actionable results that help customers comprehend the value offered by a drug therapy and to use products more efficiently and effectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Understanding and accounting for all costs and consequences of the use of a medical treatment is in the best interests of all parties involved in the prescribing, consuming, reimbursement, selling, and manufacturing of bio/pharmaceuticals. Transparency, consistency, and clear communication of costs and value are essential for appropriate decision-making and should be important goals for all parties.

AB Childbirth Connection hosted a 90th Anniversary national policy symposium, Transforming Maternity Care: A High Value Proposition, on April 3, 2009, in Washington, DC. Over 100 leaders from across the range of stakeholder perspectives were actively engaged in the symposium work to improve the quality and value of U.S. maternity care through broad system improvement. A multi-disciplinary symposium steering committee guided the strategy from its inception and contributed to every phase of the project. The "Blueprint for Action: Steps Toward a High Quality, High Value Maternity Care System", issued by the Transforming Maternity Care Symposium Steering Committee, answers the fundamental question, "Who needs to do what, to, for, and with whom to improve the quality of maternity care over the next five years?" Five stakeholder workgroups collaborated to propose actionable strategies in 11 critical focus areas for moving expeditiously toward the realization of the long term "2020 Vision for a High Quality, High Value Maternity Care System", also published in this issue. Following the symposium these workgroup reports and recommendations were synthesized into the current blueprint. For each critical focus area, the "Blueprint for Action" presents a brief problem statement, a set of system goals for improvement in that area, and major recommendations with proposed action steps to achieve them. This process created a clear sightline to action that if enacted could improve the structure, process, experiences of care, and outcomes of the maternity care system in ways that when anchored in the culture can indeed transform maternity care.

AB Over 15 years have passed since Mary's near death (Annals of Internal Medicine. 1993;118:146-148). Disappointment in the care by fellow academic physicians persists; however, a reanalysis of her case through the lens of complex systems design and performance yields a more accurate and actionable perspective. Mary's suffering was not due to human failure alone. Human failure was provoked and exacerbated by broken processes including ambiguous assignments of responsibility; inadequate transfers of information and authority; unreliable or unavailable protocols for providing safe, effective treatment; and a failure to integrate the deep but narrow perspectives of individual specialists into a complete picture of Mary's condition. Her case exemplifies, in personal terms, many of the system challenges academic medical centers face: Faculty have other missions that can conflict with patient care; disease complexity is high, requiring input from multiple subspecialists; clinical departments serve as roadblocks to communication; and novice physicians, requiring close supervision, have primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of acutely ill patients. The academic physicians who first cared for Mary unwittingly accepted flawed systems, and they failed to work around them. At great monetary and emotional expense, last-minute heroics saved Mary. In a dysfunctional system, even the most conscientious physician may be viewed as uncaring. As Mary's case so clearly illustrates, patients and their families see the system and the physician as one. Only by working to improve the systems of delivery will academic physicians again be consistently viewed as caring.

AB Sample preparation is often the most tedious and demanding step in an assay, but it also plays an essential role in determining the quality of results. As biological questions and analytical methods become increasingly sophisticated, there is a rapidly growing need for systems that can reliably and reproducibly separate cells and particles with high purity, throughput and recovery. Microfluidics technology represents a compelling approach in this regard, allowing precise control of separation forces for high performance separation in inexpensive, or even disposable, devices. In addition, microfluidics technology enables the fabrication of arrayed and integrated systems that operate either in parallel or in tandem, in a capacity that would be difficult to achieve in macro-scale systems. In this report, we use recent examples from our work to illustrate the potential of microfluidic cell- and particle-sorting devices. We demonstrate the potential of chip-based high-gradient magnetophoresis that enable high-purity separation through reversible trapping of target particles paired with high-stringency washing with minimal loss. We also describe our work in the development of devices that perform simultaneous multi-target sorting, either through precise control of magnetic and fluidic forces or through the integration of multiple actuation forces into a single monolithic device. We believe that such devices may serve as a powerful "front-end" module of highly integrated analytical platforms capable of providing actionable diagnostic information directly from crude, unprocessed samples - the success of such systems may hold the key to advancing point-of-care diagnostics and personalized medicine.

AB This paper discusses the importance of the practical turn represented by the development of clinical ethics for the field of bioethics. It discusses, first, the distinctive way that clinical ethics exhibits the practical turn in ethics. Second, it argues that primary purpose of clinical ethicists is to devise actionable approaches or "solutions" to ethical questions and issues arising in the course of patient care in addressing ethical conflicts, dilemmas, issues, and questions about cultural, personal, religious, and societal values. And, third, the paper explores the concerns about the qualifications of those who provide clinical ethics services, because the work of clinical ethics is done not only by academically trained bioethicists, but also by a broad range of health professionals on ethics consultation services and hospital ethics committees.

AB The conventional approach to cardiac implantable device follow-up involves patients attending regularly scheduled in-clinic visits to verify the functionality and safety of the implanted devices. Due to increasing patient volumes, as well as the time, capital, and human resources required, such routine device follow-up contributes a significant resource burden to already overstrained clinics and electrophysiology departments, as well as to patients and caregivers in terms of travel and time. Continuous device status monitoring via remote means (i.e., remote device monitoring) allows clinics the ability to immediately be aware of changes in device functionality to proactively respond to actionable events, and may represent a safe, effective, and cost-saving alternative to conventional in-clinic follow-up programs. The currently available systems to remotely transmit device data combine leading medical and information technology using Web-based networks that promptly provide physicians with data comparable to in-clinic follow-up visits and offer patients a high level of convenience.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate remote pacemaker interrogation for the earlier diagnosis of clinically actionable events compared with traditional transtelephonic monitoring and routine in-person evaluation.; BACKGROUND: Pacemaker patient follow-up procedures have evolved from evaluating devices with little programmability and diagnostic information solely in person to transtelephonic rhythm strip recordings that allow monitoring of basic device function. More recently developed remote monitoring technology leverages expanded device capabilities, augmenting traditional transtelephonic monitoring to evaluate patients via full device interrogation.; METHODS: The time to first diagnosis of a clinically actionable event was compared in patients who were followed by remote interrogation (Remote) and those who were followed per standard of care with office visits augmented by transtelephonic monitoring (Control). Patients were randomized 2:1. Remote arm patients transmitted pacemaker information at 3-month intervals. Control arm patients with a single-chamber pacemaker transmitted at 2-month intervals. Control arm patients with dual-chamber devices transmitted at 2-month intervals with an office visit at 6 months. All patients were seen in office at 12 months.; RESULTS: The mean time to first diagnosis of clinically actionable events was earlier in the Remote arm (5.7 months) than in the Control arm (7.7 months). Three (2%) of the 190 events in the Control arm and 446 (66%) of 676 events in the Remote arm were identified remotely.; CONCLUSIONS: The strategic use of remote pacemaker interrogation follow-up detects actionable events that are potentially important more quickly and more frequently than transtelephonic rhythm strip recordings. The use of transtelephonic rhythm strips for pacemaker follow-up is of little value except for battery status determinations.

AB BACKGROUND: Detection of critical cancer gene mutations in clinical tumor specimens may predict patient outcomes and inform treatment options; however, high-throughput mutation profiling remains underdeveloped as a diagnostic approach. We report the implementation of a genotyping and validation algorithm that enables robust tumor mutation profiling in the clinical setting.; METHODOLOGY: We developed and implemented an optimized mutation profiling platform ("OncoMap") to interrogate approximately 400 mutations in 33 known oncogenes and tumor suppressors, many of which are known to predict response or resistance to targeted therapies. The performance of OncoMap was analyzed using DNA derived from both frozen and FFPE clinical material in a diverse set of cancer types. A subsequent in-depth analysis was conducted on histologically and clinically annotated pediatric gliomas. The sensitivity and specificity of OncoMap were 93.8% and 100% in fresh frozen tissue; and 89.3% and 99.4% in FFPE-derived DNA. We detected known mutations at the expected frequencies in common cancers, as well as novel mutations in adult and pediatric cancers that are likely to predict heightened response or resistance to existing or developmental cancer therapies. OncoMap profiles also support a new molecular stratification of pediatric low-grade gliomas based on BRAF mutations that may have immediate clinical impact.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the clinical feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling to query a large panel of "actionable" cancer gene mutations. In the future, this type of approach may be incorporated into both cancer epidemiologic studies and clinical decision making to specify the use of many targeted anticancer agents.

AB The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Office of Workforce and Career Development is committed to developing a competent, sustainable, and diverse public health workforce through evidence-based training, career and leadership development, and strategic workforce planning to improve population health outcomes. This article reviews the previous efforts in identifying priorities of public health workforce research, which are summarized as eight major research themes. We outline a strategic framework for public health workforce research that includes six functional areas (ie, definition and standards, data, methodology, evaluation, policy, and dissemination and translation). To conceptualize and prioritize development of an actionable public health research agenda, we constructed a matrix of key challenges in workforce analysis by public health workforce categories. Extensive reviews were conducted to identify valuable methods, models, and approaches to public health workforce research. We explore new tools and approaches for addressing priority areas for public health workforce and career development research and assess how tools from multiple disciplines of social sciences can guide the development of a research framework for advancing public health workforce research and policy.

AB The Prometheus Payment Model offers a potential solution to the failings of the current fee-for-service system and various forms of capitation. At the core of the Prometheus model are evidence-informed case rates (ECRs), which include a bundle of typical services that are informed by evidence and/or expert opinion as well as empirical data analysis, payment based on the severity of patients, and allowances for potentially avoidable complications (PACs) and other provider-specific variations in payer costs. We outline the methods and findings of the hip and knee arthroplasty ECRs with an emphasis on PACs. Of the 2076 commercially insured patients undergoing hip arthroplasty in our study, PAC costs totaled $7.8 million (14% of total costs; n = 699 index PAC stays). Similarly, PAC costs were $12.7 million (14% of total costs; n = 897 index PAC stays) for 3403 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. By holding the providers clinically and financially responsible for PACs, and by segmenting and quantifying the type of PACs generated during and after the procedure, the Prometheus model creates an opportunity for providers to focus on the reduction of PACs, including readmissions, making the data actionable and turn the waste related to PAC costs into potential savings.

AB Recent developments in proteomics technology offer new opportunities for clinical applications in hospital or specialized laboratories including the identification of novel biomarkers, monitoring of disease, detecting adverse effects of drugs, and environmental hazards. Advanced spectrometry technologies and the development of new protein array formats have brought these analyses to a standard, which now has the potential to be used in clinical diagnostics. Besides standardization of methodologies and distribution of proteomic data into public databases, the nature of the human body fluid proteome with its high dynamic range in protein concentrations, its quantitation problems, and its extreme complexity present enormous challenges. Molecular cell biology (cytomics) with its link to proteomics is a new fast moving scientific field, which addresses functional cell analysis and bioinformatic approaches to search for novel cellular proteomic biomarkers or their release products into body fluids that provide better insight into the enormous biocomplexity of disease processes and are suitable for patient stratification, therapeutic monitoring, and prediction of prognosis. Experience from studies of in vitro diagnostics and especially in clinical chemistry showed that the majority of errors occurs in the preanalytical phase and the setup of the diagnostic strategy. This is also true for clinical proteomics where similar preanalytical variables such as inter- and intra-assay variability due to biological variations or proteolytical activities in the sample will most likely also influence the results of proteomics studies. However, before complex proteomic analysis can be introduced at a broader level into the clinic, standardization of the preanalytical phase including patient preparation, sample collection, sample preparation, sample storage, measurement, and data analysis is another issue which has to be improved. In this report, we discuss the recent advances and applications that fulfill the criteria for clinical proteomics with the focus on cellular proteomics (cytoproteomics) as related to preanalytical and analytical standardization and to quality control measures required for effective implementation of these technologies and analytes into routine laboratory testing to generate novel actionable health information. It will then be crucial to design and carry out clinical studies that can eventually identify novel clinical diagnostic strategies based on these techniques and validate their impact on clinical decision making.

AB Little has been reported regarding the nature of home visits by palliative care specialist physicians to assist in the management of complex cases. We determined the characteristics, actionable clinical findings and recommendations made during consecutive home visits conducted by a specialist physician for patients registered with a community palliative care service. Patient demographic information and clinical records were reviewed. Ninety-one patients received a total of 104 home and residential facility visits. Median patient age was 59 (Q1-Q3, 43-72). Ten children (under the age of 14) received a total of 15 visits. Seventy-three patients (80%) had a cancer diagnosis. Median visit duration was 60 min (Q1-Q3, 45-60). The major actionable clinical findings were pain (120), gastrointestinal (115), neuropsychiatric (58), mouth and skin (33) and respiratory (29). One-third of recommendations involved changes in analgesia regimen (opioids 67, adjuvants 44). The specialist physician home visit resulted in multiple patient care recommendations. This information may help palliative care programmes improve their care for patients and families in the community.

AB The children's system of care initiative in the United States requires the participation of caregivers of children with emotional or behavioral problems in conducting research and evaluation. This entails a restructuring of traditional power dynamics among families served by the community mental health system and other system stakeholders, including researchers. However, evidence indicates that system of care research may not currently embrace the different types of knowledge possessed by caregivers and may be frustrated by traditional power hierarchies, resulting in research findings that are not useful for the community. In this paper I examine a framework for power and knowledge and examine how, when viewed through this framework, participatory research in the system of care initiative thus far may be less than authentic. I conclude with improvements suggested by the framework that are expected to shift power to caregivers and result in more useful, actionable research findings for the community.

AB Disasters pose a very real threat to every individual in the United States. One way to mitigate the threat of disasters is through personal preparedness, yet numerous studies indicate that individual Americans are not prepared for a disaster. This study attempted to identify the factors most likely to predict individual disaster preparedness. We used 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from the 5 states that included the optional general preparedness module. Respondents were defined as being "prepared" if they were deficient in no more than 1 of the 6 actionable preparedness measures included on the BRFSS. Analyses were conducted comparing preparedness rates based on medical and demographic factors. Using logistic regression, a predictive model was constructed to identify which factors most strongly predicted an individual's likelihood of being prepared. Although 78% of respondents reported feeling prepared for a disaster, just 45% of respondents were actually prepared by objective measures. Factors predicting an increased likelihood of preparedness included feeling "well prepared" (OR 9.417), having a disability or health condition requiring special equipment (OR 1.298), being 55 to 64 years old (OR 1.794), and having an annual income above $50,000 (OR 1.286). Among racial and ethnic minorities, an inability to afford medical care in the previous year (OR .581) was an important factor in predicting a decreased likelihood of being prepared. This study revealed a pervasive lack of disaster preparedness overall and a substantial gap between perceived and objective preparedness. Income and age were important predictors of disaster preparedness.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current rise in diet-related diseases continues to be one of the most significant health problems facing both the developed and the developing world. The use of metabolomics - the accurate and comprehensive measurement of a significant fraction of important metabolites in accessible biological fluids - for the assessment of nutritional status is a promising way forward. The basic toolset, targets and knowledge are all being developed in the emerging field of metabolomics, yet important knowledge and technology gaps will need to be addressed in order to bring such assessment to practice.; RECENT FINDINGS: Dysregulation within the principal metabolic organs (e.g. intestine, adipose, skeletal muscle and liver) are at the center of a diet-disease paradigm that includes metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity. The assessment of both essential nutrient status and the more comprehensive systemic metabolic response to dietary, lifestyle and environmental influences (e.g. metabolic phenotype) are necessary for the evaluation of status in individuals that can identify the multiple targets of intervention needed to address metabolic disease.; SUMMARY: The first proofs of principle building the knowledge to bring actionable metabolic diagnostics to practice through metabolomics are now appearing.

AB With the recent Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and stimulus package incentives for health information technology, many clinicians are expected to adopt or enhance their use of e-prescribing systems. E-prescribing has nearly eradicated medication errors resulting from prescriber handwriting interpretations, yet several other patient-care and workflow benefits still remain a promise. As prescribers select or update their e-prescribing systems (whether stand-alone or integrated with electronic health records), close attention is needed to the e-prescribing application features and level of clinical decision support to avoid clinical blind spots, including incomplete or inaccurate patient medication lists, poor drop-down menu or screen design, and lack of clinically relevant and actionable drug interaction and drug allergy alerts. This article presents three case studies that highlight common e-prescribing problems involving diabetes patients. 2009 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB Substantial changes in not only access to care, cost, and quality of care, but also health professions education are needed to ensure effective national healthcare reform. Since the actionable determinants of health such as personal beliefs and behaviors, socioeconomic factors, and the environment disproportionately affect the poor (and often racial/ethnic minorities), many have suggested that focusing efforts on this population will both directly and indirectly improve the overall health of the nation. Key to the success of such strategies are the ongoing efforts by historically black medical schools (HBMSs) as well as other minority serving medical and health professional schools, who produce a disproportionate percentage of the high-quality and diverse health professionals that are dedicated to maintaining the health of an increasingly diverse nation. Despite their public mission, HBMSs receive limited public support threatening their ability to not only meet the increasing minority health workforce needs but to even sustain their existing contributions. Substantial changes in health education policy and funding are needed to ensure HBMSs as well as other minority-serving medical and health professional schools can continue to produce the diverse, high-quality health professional workforce necessary to maintain the health of an increasingly diverse nation. We explore several model initiatives including focused partnerships with legislative and business leaders that are urgently needed to ensure the ability of HBMSs to maintain their legacy of providing compassionate, quality care to the communities in greatest need.

AB The Philadelphia Zoo's Measuring Mission project assessed the conservation-related impacts of a visit to the Zoo and documented the results in a way that would provide a set of easily actionable planning strategies. A logic model provided a theoretical framework and guided the development of survey items. Three groups were surveyed using a pre-post retrospective instrument: zoo visitors, members, and volunteers. This report includes findings from the visitor surveys only. Data were analyzed using factor analysis, correlations, and t-tests. Results revealed that the Philadelphia Zoo has been most successful in providing its guests with a satisfying animal viewing experience, facilitated by accessible informative interpretive staff, but that guests do not always take advantage of opportunities to interact with staff. Success in achieving the Zoo's conservation mission was measured by comparing pre and posttest scores on five outcome factors (conservation motivation, conservation knowledge, pro-conservation consumer skills, conservation attitudes/values, readiness to take conservation action). The greatest gains were found in conservation knowledge and conservation motivation. Quality of exhibits and quality of staff stand out as the most important factors in influencing conservation outcomes. To ensure that results would be accessible to a wide variety of Zoo employees for planning, program and exhibit development, and staff training, nine strategies were identified as key to achieving success in the Zoo's mission. Measuring Mission has created a process for assessing the Zoo's mission impact, and has confirmed that high-quality exhibits interpreted by expert, readily available staff can influence conservation knowledge and motivation in particular.

AB  The purpose of this review paper is to provide information and guidance to those in the health care setting about why it is important to combat HIV-related stigma and how to successfully address its causes and consequences within health facilities. Research shows that stigma and discrimination in the health care setting and elsewhere contributes to keeping people, including health workers, from accessing HIV prevention, care and treatment services and adopting key preventive behaviours.Studies from different parts of the world reveal that there are three main immediately actionable causes of HIV-related stigma in health facilities: lack of awareness among health workers of what stigma looks like and why it is damaging; fear of casual contact stemming from incomplete knowledge about HIV transmission; and the association of HIV with improper or immoral behaviour.To combat stigma in health facilities, interventions must focus on the individual, environmental and policy levels. The paper argues that reducing stigma by working at all three levels is feasible and will likely result in long-lasting benefits for both health workers and HIV-positive patients. The existence of tested stigma-reduction tools and approaches has moved the field forward. What is needed now is the political will and resources to support and scale up stigma-reduction activities throughout health care settings globally.

AB Biophysical applications ranging from fluorescence microassays to single-molecule microscopy are increasingly dependent on automated nanoscale positional control and stability. A whirlwind of motion-industry innovation has resulted in an array of new motion options offering significant improvements in application performance, reproducibility and throughput. The challenge to leverage these developments depends on researchers, engineers and motion vendors acquiring a common language of specifications and a shared understanding of the challenges posed by application needs. To assist in building this shared understanding, this article reviews today's motion technologies, beginning with a concise review of key principles of motion control focusing on applications. It progresses through illustrations of sensor/encoder technologies and servo techniques. A spectrum of classical and recent motion technologies is explored, from stepper and servo actuation of conventional microscopy stages, to advanced piezo stack nanopositioners capable of picometer precision, to novel ultrasonic resonant piezomotors and piezo-ceramic-based mechanisms capable of high-force positioning over many millimeters while providing resolutions down into the sub-nanometer range. A special emphasis is placed on the effects of integrating multiple motion technologies into an application, such as stacking a fine nanopositioner atop a long-travel stage. Examples and data are presented to clarify these issues, including important and insightful new stability measurements taken directly from an advanced optical trapping application. The important topics of software and interfacing are also explored from an applications perspective, since design-and-debugging time, synchronization capabilities and overall throughput are heavily dependent on these often-overlooked aspects of motion system design. The discussion is designed to illuminate specifications-related topics that become increasingly important as precision requirements tighten. Throughout, both traditional and novel techniques and approaches are explored so that readers are left with a solid overview of the state of the art, and an actionable perspective that readies them to discuss and evaluate specifications and vendor capabilities against practical application requirements.

AB BACKGROUND: In 2006, the British Columbia (BC) government passed amendments to its Safety Standards Act. These amendments permit the routine disclosure of electrical usage information from electrical producers to BC's municipalities, ostensibly to identify and eradicate residential cannabis growing operations (grow ops). These amendments originated in a pilot project in Surrey, BC, known as the electrical and fire safety inspection initiative (EFSI), which drew together police, firefighters and others, to identify grow ops through the process of municipal electrical inspections.; METHODS: This paper draws on narrative analysis to critically explore how the report of the EFSI Surrey pilot project uses a series of linked claims to generate interpretative change in the definition of the problem of grow ops. This analysis also shows how claims about grow ops are constructed and gain their potency through links with other social problems, persons, and practices.; RESULTS: Though the report of the EFSI project is a prohibitionist text replete with stock characters and themes from the history of Canadian drug policy, the problem of residential cannabis cultivation is made actionable by establishing grow operators as "superdeviants" constructed both as dangerous outsiders and as risks to a host of public safety concerns. These claims are then linked to the notion of an overwhelmed criminal justice system that establishes a "crisis" that justifies extraordinary methods of social control outside the due process of the criminal justice system.; CONCLUSIONS: Construction of all cannabis cultivators as "dangerous" disavows other possibilities and shores up neo-liberal practices of government that draw on multi-partner initiatives to implement extraordinary methods of social control not necessarily subject to public accountability.

AB BACKGROUND: Bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospitalization, and cost. We identified baseline clinical characteristics associated with bleeding complications after PCI and developed a simplified, clinically useful algorithm to predict patient risk.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 302 152 PCI procedures performed at 440 US centers participating in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry. As defined by the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, bleeding required transfusion, prolonged hospital stay, and/or a drop in hemoglobin >3.0 g/dL from any location, including percutaneous entry site, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and other/unknown location. Bleeding complications occurred in 2.4% of patients. From the best-fitting model consisting of 15 clinical elements associated with post-PCI bleeding in a random 80% training cohort, we developed a parsimonious risk algorithm. Predictors of bleeding included age, gender, previous heart failure, glomerular filtration rate, peripheral vascular disease, no previous PCI, New York Heart Association/Canadian Cardiovascular Society Functional Classification class IV heart failure, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock. The parsimonious model was validated in the remaining 20% of the population (c-statistic, 0.72) and in clinically relevant subgroups of patients. This simplified model was used to derive a clinical risk algorithm, with larger numbers corresponding with greater risk. In 3 categories, bleeding rates were greater in patients with higher estimates (<or=7, 0.7%; 8 to 17, 1.8%; >or=18, 5.1%).; CONCLUSIONS: This report identifies baseline clinical factors associated with bleeding and proposes a clinically useful algorithm to estimate bleeding risk. This model is potentially actionable in altering therapeutic decision making and improving outcomes in patients undergoing PCI.

AB Improving quality at the point of care, the practice site, has become the focal point of many health quality initiatives. Practice sites vary greatly in their levels of knowledge, comfort, and willingness to embark upon quality improvement activities. The objective of this study was to improve consistency of adherence to diabetes evidence-based guidelines; to engage physicians in critical review of their practice patterns around care of diabetic patients; and to change office systems to improve care. The survey used the Diabetes Chart Review Tool for 9 quality improvement cycles at 6-month intervals. The participants were adult primary care physicians with a minimum of 170 commercial members (n = 170-331 physicians, depending on cycle). Participating physicians received a random sample of 15 patients with diabetes for whom they review their medical records to complete a diabetes questionnaire. The survey was scored and physician-specific detail and summary reports were generated. Reports were reviewed with physicians by health plan representatives. The survey was monetary incentive participation-based in early cycles, with performance-based incentives added after the third year. The main outcome measure was the rate of cases meeting specific diabetes process and outcome measures and composite adherence to guideline score. The results were a participation rate above 84% for eligible physicians (32,069 chart reviews), and steady improvement in all process and outcome measures. Adherence to diabetes clinical guidelines shows statistically significant improvement (Student's t test, P < 0.001, mean difference -1.8, confidence interval 1.9-1.7) from baseline. The program achieved significant improvement in comprehensive diabetes care at the physician practice site level. Success is attributed to engagement of physicians, actionable reports, office-based education, written action plans, and alignment with our internal disease management.

AB Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

AB Although the volume of medical information is growing rapidly, the ability to rapidly convert this data into "actionable insights" and new medical knowledge is lagging far behind. The first step in the knowledge discovery process is data management and integration, which logically can be accomplished through the application of data warehouse technologies. A key insight that arises from efforts in biosurveillance and the global scope of military medicine is that information must be integrated over both time (longitudinal health records) and space (spatial localization of health-related events). Once data are compiled and integrated it is essential to encode the semantics and relationships among data elements through the use of ontologies and semantic web technologies to convert data into knowledge. Medical images form a special class of health-related information. Traditionally knowledge has been extracted from images by human observation and encoded via controlled terminologies. This approach is rapidly being replaced by quantitative analyses that more reliably support knowledge extraction. The goals of knowledge discovery are the improvement of both the timeliness and accuracy of medical decision making and the identification of new procedures and therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: Simple hypertension outcome measures may not indicate which patients receive poor care. This could be problematic as incentives increase.; OBJECTIVE: Compare measured quality using simple outcome measures to more sophisticated measures utilizing data available within an electronic health record.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.; SUBJECTS: A total of 5905 hypertensive adults with 3 or more clinic visits between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006 at an internal medicine clinic.; MEASURES: We measured simple control as the proportion of diagnosed hypertension patients with their last blood pressure below goal (<140/90 mm Hg or <130/80 if diabetic). We compared this to sequentially more complex measures.; RESULTS: Among nondiabetic patients, baseline measurement of control was 58.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 56.5-59.6]. Counting patients as having adequate care whose last or mean blood pressure was at or below goal raised performance to 75.4%. Accounting for patients prescribed aggressive treatment raised it to 82.5%. Accounting for low diastolic blood pressure raised it to 83.6%. Including patients with undiagnosed hypertension lowered it to 80.5%. For diabetes patients, baseline measurement of control was 29.9% (95% CI, 27.6-32.3) and changed to 46.4%, 72.8%, 76.7%, and 73.6%, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use electronic health record data to devise hypertension measures that may better reflect who has actionable uncontrolled blood pressure, do not penalize clinicians treating resistant hypertension patients, reduce the encouragement of potentially unsafe practices, and identify patients possibly receiving poor care with no hypertension diagnosis. This could improve the detection of true quality problems and remove incentives to over treat or stop caring for patients with resistant hypertension.

AB The already frayed mental health and addictions safety net is in danger of collapse as demand for behavioral health services reaches an all-time high. The backdrop to our field's everyday struggles is health care reform. The details and implications of health care reform for the mental health and addictions community remain uncertain. What is certain is that we must build upon our 2008 legislative successes. While health care reform evolves, the National Council is focused on moving a practical actionable 2009 agenda that includes single points of accountability for continuity of care for people with serious mental illnesses and addictions, cost-based-plus financing that supports clinical excellence, a federal mental health funding stream dedicated to mental health and integrated treatment services for the uninsured, funds to support investments by behavioral health care organizations in information technology, and support for research-based education and prevention practices.

AB Among the most typical consequences of disasters is the near or complete collapse of terrestrial telecommunications infrastructures (especially the distribution network--the 'last mile') and their concomitant unavailability to the rescuers and the higher echelons of mitigation teams. Even when such damage does not take place, the communications overload/congestion resulting from significantly elevated traffic generated by affected residents can be highly disturbing. The paper proposes innovative remedies to the telecommunications difficulties in disaster struck regions. The offered solutions are network-centric operations-cap able, and can be employed in management of disasters of any magnitude (local to national or international). Their implementation provide ground rescue teams (such as law enforcement, firemen, healthcare personnel, civilian authorities) with tactical connectivity among themselves, and, through the Next Generation Network backbone, ensure the essential bidirectional free flow of information and distribution of Actionable Knowledge among ground units, command/control centres, and civilian and military agencies participating in the rescue effort.

AB BACKGROUND: Insurers and policymakers strive to stimulate more cost-effective prescribing and, increasingly, are educating beneficiaries about generics.; OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between patient beliefs and communication about generic drugs and actual drug use.; RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We performed a national mailed survey of a random sample of 2500 commercially-insured adults. Patient responses were linked to pharmacy claims data to assess actual generic medication use.; MEASURES: We used factor analysis to develop 5 multi-item scales from patient survey responses that measured: (1) general preferences for generics, (2) generic safety/effectiveness, (3) generic cost/value, (4) comfort with generic substitution, and (5) communication with providers about generics. The relationship between each scale and the proportion of prescriptions filled for generics was assessed using linear regression, controlling for demographic, health, and insurance characteristics. Separate models were created for each scale and then all 5 scales were included simultaneously in a fully-adjusted model.; RESULTS: The usable response rate was 48%. When evaluated independently, a 1 SD increase in each of the 5 scales was associated with a 3.1% to 6.3% increase in generic drug use (P < 0.05 for each). In the fully adjusted model, only 2 scales were significantly associated with generic drug use: comfort with generic substitution (P = 0.021) and communication with providers about generic drugs (P = 0.012).; CONCLUSIONS: Generic drug use is most closely associated with the 2 actionable items we evaluated: communication with providers about generics and comfort with generic substitution. Educational campaigns that focus on these 2 domains may be most effective at influencing generic drug use.

AB Debriefing is essential element of simulation; however, practices vary greatly. Common elements include critique, correction, and evaluation of student performance and discussion of the experience. Learning occurs in simulation through contextual task training and repetition, but significant learning occurs when deep insight is made explicit through reflection during debriefing. The value of the student's learning is in the student's ability to engage in reflection that translates into actionable knowledge. Facilitating debriefing emphasizing reflection is an essential competency, yet little research and resources are available to guide best practices in debriefing. This article analyzes the concept of debriefing and identifies essential components. Examples that demonstrate defining attributes of debriefing are included. This work supports the identification of best practices and future research agendas to enable nurse educators to master the knowledge and strategies needed to provide students with significant learning during simulation.

AB CONTEXT: Obesity constitutes a major public health challenge in the United States. Obesogenic environments have increased owing to the consumption of calorie-dense foods of low nutritional value and the reduction of daily physical activity (e.g., increased portion sizes of meals eaten in and out of the home and fewer physical activity requirements in schools). Policymakers and public health practitioners need to know the best practices and have the competencies to use laws and legal authorities to reverse the obesity epidemic. For instance, statutes and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels of government have been implemented to improve nutritional choices and access to healthy foods, encourage physical activity, and educate consumers about adopting healthy lifestyles.; METHODS: In an effort to understand the application of laws and legal authorities for obesity prevention and control, in June 2008 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened the National Summit on Legal Preparedness for Obesity Prevention and Control. An outcome of this summit will be the publication of the proceeding's white papers written by eight law and subject-matter experts with substantive contributions from summit participants, which will identify actionable options that sectors and organizations at various jurisdictional levels can consider adopting.; FINDINGS: Law has played a critical role in the control of chronic diseases and the behaviors that lead to them. The use of a systematic legal framework--the use of legislation, regulation, and policy to address the multiple factors that contribute to obesogenic environments--can assist in the development, implementation, and evaluation of a variety of legal approaches for obesity prevention and control.; CONCLUSIONS: Although public health-focused legal interventions are in an early stage and the direct and indirect impact they may have on the obesity epidemic is not yet understood, efforts such as the summit and white papers should help determine potentially viable legal interventions and assess their impact on population-level change.

AB BACKGROUND: Adoption of EHRs by U.S. ambulatory practices has been slow despite the perceived benefits of their use. Most evaluations of EHR implementations in the literature apply to large practice settings. While there are similarities relating to EHR implementation in large and small practice settings, the authors argue that scale is an important differentiator. Focusing on small ambulatory practices, this paper outlines the benefits and barriers to EHR use in this setting, and provides a "field guide" for these practices to facilitate successful EHR implementation.; DISCUSSION: The benefits of EHRs in ambulatory practices include improved patient care and office efficiency, and potential financial benefits. Barriers to EHRs include costs; lack of standardization of EHR products and the design of vendor systems for large practice environments; resistance to change; initial difficulty of system use leading to productivity reduction; and perceived accrual of benefits to society and payers rather than providers. The authors stress the need for developing a flexible change management strategy when introducing EHRs that is relevant to the small practice environment; the strategy should acknowledge the importance of relationship management and the role of individual staff members in helping the entire staff to manage change. Practice staff must create an actionable vision outlining realistic goals for the implementation, and all staff must buy into the project. The authors detail the process of implementing EHRs through several stages: decision, selection, pre-implementation, implementation, and post-implementation. They stress the importance of identifying a champion to serve as an advocate of the value of EHRs and provide direction and encouragement for the project. Other key activities include assessing and redesigning workflow; understanding financial issues; conducting training that is well-timed and meets the needs of practice staff; and evaluating the implementation process.; SUMMARY: The EHR implementation experience depends on a variety of factors including the technology, training, leadership, the change management process, and the individual character of each ambulatory practice environment. Sound processes must support both technical and personnel-related organizational components. Additional research is needed to further refine recommendations for the small physician practice and the nuances of specific medical specialties.

AB Palliative care services are increasingly available to primary care physicians for both expert consultations and services to seriously ill patients. The United States now has more than 1400 hospital-based palliative care teams and more than 4700 hospice programs. We use an illustrative case of a palliative care hospitalization and intervention for a middle-aged man with severe pain from spinal metastases to discuss 4 key questions that a primary care physician faces in caring for the seriously ill patient with difficult symptom management: (1) Should I refer a patient to a hospital-based palliative care team or to hospice services for difficult symptom management? (2) If the patient is referred to a hospital-based palliative care team, what should I, as the primary care physician, expect? (3) When should I refer to hospice services a patient initially referred to a hospital-based palliative care team? and (4) How can I choose a hospice program that will provide competent, coordinated, and compassionate patient- and family-centered care? Primary care physicians now may choose among hospice programs, and the programs may vary in their quality of care. Validated tools to measure patient and family perceptions of the quality of hospice care are now available but progress in defining and measuring the quality of hospice care is still needed before actionable information will be available to guide the choice of hospice programs for physicians and consumers.

AB To improve health outcomes, effective and systematic mechanisms to foster the adoption of evidence-based guideline recommendations into routine practice need to be identified. A cyclical process for achieving this objective involving three key phases is suggested. Phase 1. Writing actionable best-evidence guidelines that prioritize key recommendations while indicating the levels of adoption needed for population health benefits to be accomplished. Phase 2. Developing implementation plans for the priority guideline recommendations. These should systematically consider skills training and accreditation; social influences including opinion leaders and patient influences; environmental factors; monitoring and feedback; and incentives for clinical change. Phase 3. Pilot testing the effectiveness of proposed approaches in producing the desired clinical changes. If implementation requires system changes and evaluation at an organizational level, the use of alternative research designs to the randomized controlled trial could be considered. The purpose evaluation would be to enable refinement of the implementation plans before widespread dissemination.

AB INTRODUCTION: Effective feedback from incident reporting systems in healthcare is essential if organisations are to learn from failures in the delivery of care. Despite the wide-scale development and implementation of incident reporting in healthcare, studies in the UK suggest that information concerning system vulnerabilities could be better applied to improve operational safety within organisations. In this article, the findings and implications of research to identify forms of effective feedback from incident reporting are discussed, to promote best practices in this area.; METHODS: The research comprised a mixed methods review to investigate mechanisms of effective feedback for healthcare, drawing upon experience within established reporting programmes in high-risk industry and transport domains. Systematic searches of published literature were undertaken, and 23 case studies describing incident reporting programmes with feedback were identified for analysis from the international healthcare literature. Semistructured interviews were undertaken with 19 subject matter experts across a range of domains, including: civil aviation, maritime, energy, rail, offshore production and healthcare.; RESULTS: In analysis, qualitative information from several sources was synthesised into practical requirements for developing effective feedback in healthcare. Both action and information feedback mechanisms were identified, serving safety awareness, improvement and motivational functions. The provision of actionable feedback that visibly improved systems was highlighted as important in promoting future reporting. Fifteen requirements for the design of effective feedback systems were identified, concerning: the role of leadership, the credibility and content of information, effective dissemination channels, the capacity for rapid action and the need for feedback at all levels of the organisation, among others. Above all, the safety-feedback cycle must be closed by ensuring that reporting, analysis and investigation result in timely corrective actions that effectively address vulnerabilities in existing work systems.; CONCLUSIONS: Limited research evidence exists concerning the issue of effective forms of safety feedback within healthcare. Much valuable operational knowledge resides in safety management communities within high-risk industries. Multiple means of feeding back recommended actions and safety information may be usefully employed to promote safety awareness, improve clinical processes and promote future reporting. Further work is needed to establish best practices for feedback systems in healthcare that effectively close the safety loop.

AB Optical biosensors have begun to move from the laboratory to the point of use. This trend will be accelerated by new concepts for molecular recognition, integration of microfluidics and optics, simplified fabrication technologies, improved approaches to biosensor system integration, and dramatically increased awareness of the applicability of sensor technology to improve public health and environmental monitoring. Examples of innovations are identified that will lead to smaller, faster, cheaper optical biosensor systems with capacity to provide effective and actionable information.

AB Road safety performance indicators (SPI) have recently been proposed as a useful instrument in comparing countries on the performance of different risk aspects of their road safety system. In this respect, SPIs should be actionable, i.e. they should provide clear directions for policymakers about what action is needed and which priorities should be set in order to improve a country's road safety level in the most efficient way. This paper aims at contributing to this issue by proposing a computational model based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). Based on the model output, the good and bad aspects of road safety are identified for each country. Moreover, targets and priorities for policy actions can be set. As our data set contains 21 European countries for which a separate, best possible model is constructed, a number of country-specific policy actions can be recommended. Conclusions are drawn regarding the following performance indicators: alcohol and drugs, speed, protective systems, vehicle, infrastructure and trauma management. For each country that performs relatively poor, a particular country will be assigned as a useful benchmark.

AB In the past decade, convincing evidence has emerged that perioperative glycemic control in certain settings, especially cardiac surgery and the surgical ICU, can decrease morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear, however, if hypoglycemia is a cause of death or marker of patient acuity. It is clear, however, that the particular intensive glycemic control protocol matters because the rate of hypoglycemia varies across protocols and institutions. The best current evidence for tight control rests in the population of surgical patients needing more than 5 days of critical care. Many questions still remain, such as the optimum blood sugar or the best protocol to implement glucose control, minimizing hypoglycemia. Further information will become available from the Normogylcemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation trial, currently enrolling patients in a prospective randomized trial to answer some of these outstanding questions. Maintaining euglycemia postoperatively is a simple and actionable step that could decrease the risk of postoperative infections and postoperative mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: To determine the most significant potentially actionable clinical variables associated with mortality and hospitalization risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients.; STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study.; SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult maintenance HD patients in the Fresenius Medical Care, North America database as of January 1, 2004, with baseline information from October 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, comprising approximately 26% of the US HD population.; PREDICTORS: Case-mix (age, sex, race, diabetes, vintage, and body surface area), vascular access, and laboratory (albumin, equilibrated Kt/V, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, bicarbonate, biointact parathyroid hormone, transferrin saturation, and white blood cell count) variables.; OUTCOMES: 1-year mortality and hospitalization risk from January 1 to December 31, 2004.; MEASUREMENTS: Cox proportional hazards models for death and hospitalization.; RESULTS: The cohort (N = 78,420) had a mean age of 61.4 +/- 15.0 years, 47% were women, 49% were white, 41% were black race (10% defined as "other"), and 52% had diabetes. The top 5 actionable variables were the same for mortality and hospitalization. Final case-mix plus laboratory-adjusted hazard ratios for these top 5 actionable variables indicate 177% increased risk of death and 67% increased risk of hospitalization per 1-g/dL decrease in albumin level, 39% and 45% greater risk with catheters compared with fistulas, 18% and 9% greater risk per 1-mg/dL greater phosphorus level, 11% and 9% lower risk per 1-g/dL greater hemoglobin level, and 5% and 2% greater risk per 0.1-unit decrease in equilibrated Kt/V, respectively (all P < 0.0001).; LIMITATIONS: Observational cross-sectional study with limited comorbidity adjustment (for diabetes).; CONCLUSION: The same variables are associated with both mortality and hospitalization in HD patients. The top 5 potentially actionable variables are readily identifiable, with albumin level and catheter use the most prominent, and all 5 are appropriate targets for improvement.

AB AIM: To determine the iatrogenic absorbed dosage of radiation of the patient in milligray (mGy) computerised tomography dose index volume (CTDIvol) when tested with multidetector computerised tomography (MDCT) in the emergency department (ED) setting and calculate the absorbed dosage of radiation per clinically actionable result and emergently treatable finding (ETF).; SETTING: The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) ED located in Galveston, Texas, USA, is a level 1 trauma and tertiary referral centre treating 70,000 patients per annum.; METHOD: A retrospective cross-sectional data analysis of 770 emergency patients investigated by MDCT in July 2007. The presence of actionable results and ETF were determined by chart review.; RESULTS: A total of 5320 emergency patients was treated in the UTMB ED in July 2007. This included 4508 medical and 812 trauma patients. A total of 1094 MDCT studies was performed, of which complete data were available on 1046. A total of 770 patients was investigated by MDCT, representing 14.47% of all emergency patients. This included 33.99% of trauma patients and 10.96% of medical patients. Actionable results were found in 341 studies and ETF in 105 studies. The mean radiation was 163.27 and 530.23 mGy CTDIvol for actionable results and ETF, respectively, for all studies. The mean radiation was 53.27 and 106.36 mGy CTDIvol for medical and trauma patients, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: The absorbed dosage of radiation of patients investigated by MDCT is clinically significant. The actionable results and ETF in our study demonstrate considerable opportunity for improvement in the utilisation of this technology by physicians.

AB Sexual relationships between young women and older men involving economic transactions have been offered as a likely explanation for gender differences in HIV prevalence in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. This study employed peer ethnography to explore young women's construction of social identity and risk within age-disparate transactional sexual relationships in Maputo, Mozambique. Peer ethnography, a rapid approach derived from the anthropological method and based upon training members of the target group to carry out in-depth qualitative interviews with their peers, was adopted in order to gather ethnographic data within a short timeframe to produce actionable results for the design of a communications intervention. The study highlights young women's perception of agency and power in these relationships. Through a strategy of extracting financial and material resources from men based on the power of their sexuality, young women construct a positive identity and esteem linked to perceptions of modernity and consumption and their ability to access consumer goods. Current behaviour change HIV prevention messages have little meaning in relation to young women's perceived goals, in a context in which structural conditions offer few opportunities and limited hope for a secure economic future.

AB Pharmacogenetics (PGX) is the study of drug response as a function of an individual's DNA. PGX is often viewed as an extension of disease association genetics, and although this information may be related, it is not the study of drug response. Although medicines are used to treat diseases, the value of strategies that identify and incorporate DNA biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy, or DNA biomarkers for untoward clinical responses, can be applied directly to pharmaceutical pipelines. The growth of adverse event PGX studies involving marketed medicines generally uses relatively large numbers of affected patients, but has been productive. However, the two critical strategies for pipeline genetics must make use of fewer patients: (1) the early identification of efficacy signals so that they can be applied early in development for targeted therapies and (2) identification of safety signals that can subsequently be validated prospectively during development using the least number of patients with adverse responses. Assumptions are often made that large numbers of patients are necessary to recognize PGX hypotheses and to validate DNA biomarkers. In some ways, pipeline pharmacogenetics may be viewed as the opposite of current genome-wide scanning designs. The goal is to obtain PGX signals in as few patients as possible, and then validate PGX hypotheses for specificity and sensitivity as development trials go forward--not using hundreds of thousand of markers to detect strong linkage disequilibrium signals in thousands of patients and their controls. Drug development takes 5-7 years for a drug candidate to traverse to registration--and this is similar to the timeframe for validating genetic biomarkers using sequential clinical trials. Two important examples are discussed, the association of APOE genotypes to the demonstration of actionable efficacy signals for the use of rosiglitazone for Alzheimer's disease; and the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). The rosiglitazone study prevented pipeline attrition by changing the interpretation of a critical Phase IIB proof of concept study (2005) from a failed study, to a positive efficacy response in a genetically predictable proportion of patients. Now, three years later, a Phase III program of clinical trials using pharmacogenetic designs is months away from completion (late08). If successfully registered (early09), millions of patients could benefit, and efficacy PGX would have achieved its first prospective block-buster. The use of safety candidate gene association genetics in patients who received abacavir therapy and developed HSS starting in 1998 culminated in a double blind clinical trial that determined sensitivity > 97% and specificity >99% in 2007. Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing, immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events. Targeting of medicines during drug development is now possible, practical, and profitable.

AB OBJECTIVES: This article describes findings from the California Gonorrhea Surveillance System (CGSS), developed in response to the need for detailed risk behavior data and clinical data required to control increasing gonorrhea (GC) infections in California.; METHODS: CGSS is a sample-based surveillance system implemented throughout California in 2007. In 34 of 61 local health jurisdictions (LHJs), 10% of GC cases are sampled for interview; in the other 27 LHJs, all cases are followed. A standardized case investigation record collects case-reported risk data and provider-reported clinical data, and is electronically prepopulated with available contact data. Exclusion criteria include age younger than 14 years, a GC diagnosis within the previous 30 days, and provider request that patient not be contacted. Analyses are weighted to account for sample design.; RESULTS: In 2007, 31,192 cases of GC were reported in California. Of these, 5,388 were sampled for follow-up and 2,715 were interviewed, for a response rate of 54.2%. Of those interviewed, 49.6% were female, 28.8% were heterosexual males, and 21.6% were men who have sex with men (MSM). CGSS collects a wide range of behavioral and clinical data for targeted programmatic action. Findings from the 2007 CGSS included data on the following areas: incarceration (highest among heterosexual males [22.4%]); methamphetamine use (high overall [12.2%] and lower among African Americans [4.6%]); co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (high among MSM [31.9%] and very low among heterosexual males and females [<0.5%]); and improper antibiotic use (8.3% overall; 25.6% among patients attending urgent care clinics).; CONCLUSION: CGSS, an innovative sample-based surveillance system, is effective and flexible. The system provides actionable data on an ongoing basis.

AB In the globalized knowledge economy, the challenge of translating knowledge into policy and practice is universal. At the dawn of the 21st century, the clinicians, leaders, and managers of health care organizations are increasingly required to bridge the research-practice gap. A shift from moving evidence to solving problems is due. However, despite a vast literature on the burgeoning field of knowledge translation research, the "evidence-based" issue remains for many health care professionals a day-to-day debate leading to unresolved questions. On one hand, many clinicians still resist to the implementation of evidence-based clinical practice, asking themselves why their current practice should be changed or expanded. On the other hand, many leaders and managers of health care organizations are searching how to keep pace with the demand of actionable knowledge. For example, they are wondering: (a) if managerial and policy innovations are subjected to the same evidentiary standards as clinical innovations, and (b) how they can adapt the scope of evidence-based medicine to the culture, context, and content of health policy and management. This paper focuses on evidence-based health care management within the context of contemporary globalization. In this paper, our heuristic hypothesis is that decision-making process related changes within clinical/managerial/policy environments must be given a socio-historical backdrop. We argue that the relationship between research on the transfer of knowledge and its uptake by clinical, managerial and policy target audiences has undergone a shift, resulting in increasing pressures in health care for intense researcher-practitioner collaboration and the development of "integrative KT platforms" at the crossroads of different fields (the field of knowledge management and the field of knowledge translation). The objectives of this paper are: (a) to provide an answer to the questions that health professionals ask most frequently about "Why" and "How" to bridge the know-do gap, (b) to illustrate by a Canadian example how the PRO-ACTIVE program helps in closing the evidence-based practice gap.

AB In 2004, the Knowledge-based Nursing Initiative (KBNI) began as a partnership between a university-based college of nursing, an informatics vendor, and a large, integrated health care system. The goal was to develop a process for translating evidence into actionable recommendations, embedding the recommendations into the computerized decision support and documentation systems, and supporting nurses' use of the nursing process to individualize care. This paper will describe the essential administrative, information technology (IT), educational and clinical support activities that were used to deploy this innovation into the electronic health record (EHR) and workflow of nurses on two acute care medical pilot units in July of 2008. The project supported every nurse to document their evidenced-based practice with each patient contact and populate the EHR database with rich, nursing sensitive, retrievable data for quality improvement and research. The results included verifying data reliability and validity, evaluating go-live preparation, and summarizing the qualitative and quantitative findings. Two critical factors that made this implementation a success were that the project had a transformational vision and that it was led by the clinical team and strongly supported by the IT team. The lessons learned in the adoption phase will be diffused to the rest of the health care system and beyond.

AB OBJECTIVE: To contrast the advantages and limitations of using medication, diagnostic, and cost data to prospectively identify candidates for care management programs.; METHODS: Risk scores from prior-cost information and a set of clinically based predictive models (PMs) derived from diagnostic and medication data sources, as well as from a combination of all 3 data sources, were assigned to a national sample of commercially insured, non-elderly adults (n = 2,259,584). Clinical relevance of risk groups and statistical performance using future costs as the outcome were contrasted across the PMs.; RESULTS: Compared with prior cost, diagnostic and medication-based PMs identified high-risk groups with a higher burden of clinically actionable characteristics. Statistical performance was similar and in some cases better for the clinical PMs compared with prior cost. The best classification accuracy was obtained with a comprehensive model that united diagnostic, medication, and prior-cost risk factors.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinically based PMs are a better choice than prior cost alone for programs that seek to identify high-risk groups of patients who are amenable to care management services.

AB To adapt Churchill's comment on democracy, "No one pretends that [POLSTs are] perfect..." but physicians' orders about life-sustaining treatments are a very important supplement to advance directives, especially for patients who are extremely or terminally ill, and most particularly for patients who require emergency treatment by first responders or by physicians who do not know them as persons. The standardized orders of limited options, however, are no substitute for a detailed treatment directive of a patient with a known illness, with predictable trajectories and complications. And, in this latter circumstance, a thoroughly informed proxy may also assist physicians in selecting appropriate treatment for patients who have lost decisional capacity and/or the ability to express it. I believe all patients should have an advance directive, preferably a combined proxy-treatment directive, and preferably one that has been thoroughly discussed with the attending physician and with the proxy, successor proxies, and preferably relatives and friends. Nurses, social workers, and chaplains may be very helpful to the patient in thinking through his or her preferences, especially if the severity of illness and the limited efficacy of interventions are such that the patient would wish to omit life-sustaining treatment or to discontinue it after a time-limited trial. Finally, because POLST is new or yet to be initiated in many areas of the country, it behooves all physicians to become knowledgeable of POLST and to initiate discussion of it with colleagues, patients, patients' proxies, and with relatives of patients. Even more recent is the combined advance directive/physician's orders to permit natural dying, actionable immediately for patients suffering severely and irremediably, but actionable at a future time if the patient progresses to advanced stages of dementia or other devastating brain disorders. In order to encourage physicians to initiate advance care planning with their patients, this quote from a patient shortly before his death from prostatic cancer might prove helpful: "Not every patient can be saved, but his illness can be eased by the way that the doctor responds to him. In learning to talk to his patients, the doctor may talk himself back into loving his work. He has little to lose and everything to gain by letting the sick man into his heart. If he does, they can share--as few others can--the wonder, terror, and exultation of being on the edge of being"

AB OBJECTIVE: Recent clinical pediatric practice guidelines reiterate the importance of key messages to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, including the consumption of at least five servings of fruits or vegetables each day, a limit to screen time (time spent watching TV, using a computer, and playing video games) of two hours or less per day, engagement in at least one hour of physical activity per day, and the consumption of no sugary beverages each day. The perceptions of primary caregivers of obese children of these key messages are less clear. We explored parents' (or caregivers') awareness of and confidence in adopting a variation of the expert committee's recommended (5-2-1-Almost None [AN]) behaviors.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Before the initiation of treatment, parents of obese children completed a survey designed to explore their awareness of and confidence in adopting 5-2-1-AN behaviors. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to assess how aware these families are of 5-2-1-AN behaviors and how confident they would be of their ability to guide adoption of these specific behaviors.; RESULTS: Parents from 193 families indicated that weight management depends substantially on physical activity (63%). However, parents rated as less important consuming fruits and vegetables (17%), controlling portions (13%), eliminating sugary drinks (4%), reducing screen time (3%), eating breakfast each morning (1%), and having family dinners (1%). Almost universally, respondents reported significantly reduced confidence in helping their child adopt nonspecific lifestyle changes in eating and physical activity versus the targeted behaviors identified in 5-2-1-AN.; CONCLUSION: Parents surveyed for this clinical study readily accept certain aspects of the 5-2-1-AN message as factors in healthy living. Despite low levels of reported awareness of the message, the consumption of almost no sugary drinks was the only actionable behavior in the 5-2-1-AN message that parents felt significantly more confident they could achieve than the nonspecific goal of improved eating. These perceptions can be used to help guide the adoption of 5-2-1-AN strategies as well as help clinicians target messages for specific healthy behavior adoption.

AB BACKGROUND: Medicare data indicate that black hemodialysis patients receive greater doses of erythropoietin (EPO) than white patients when achieving similar hemoglobin levels. We confirmed and evaluated this observed association between race and EPO dose.; STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.; SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Primary Medicare-insured white (57%) and black (43%) adult long-term hemodialysis patients treated by Fresenius Medical Care who received EPO from January 1 to 31, 2004 (N = 44,721).; PREDICTOR: White/black race.; OUTCOMES: Average weekly EPO dose.; MEASUREMENTS: Associations between race and baseline demographic and laboratory variables were evaluated by using logistic and linear regression models. Correlates of log-transformed weekly EPO dose were determined using linear regression models.; RESULTS: Black patients received 12.6% more EPO than white patients (95% limits, 10.9% to 14.3%; P < 0.001). This racial difference in EPO dose was observed across similar hemoglobin levels despite fewer catheters (P < 0.001) and fewer prior hospitalization events in black patients (P = 0.002). Black patients were younger and had larger body size and greater albumin and biointact parathyroid hormone levels, but lower equilibrated Kt/V and white blood cell counts (all P < 0.001). In the 95th percentile of EPO dose (those receiving > 60,000 U/wk), there was a greater proportion of black patients (6% of total black population compared with only 4% in all white patients; P < 0.001). The difference in EPO dose between black and white patients was modified by age and was significant at ages younger than 45 and 65 years or older.; LIMITATIONS: Observational study limited to white and black adult Medicare patients only, correlating with EPO doses from a single month, without adjustment for comorbid conditions.; CONCLUSIONS: Black patients were administered approximately 12% greater EPO doses than white patients while achieving similar hemoglobin levels. We identified variables that differed across race that may explain this difference, but they were either not actionable or presented limited opportunity for intervention. Additional studies are needed to define a physiological (or pathological) basis for these observations.

AB The ever-increasing complexity of disasters demands utilisation of knowledge that exists outside domains traditionally drawn upon in disaster management. To be operationally useful, such knowledge must he extracted, combined with information generated by the disaster itself, and transformed into actionable knowledge. The process, though, is hampered by existing, business-oriented approaches to knowledge management, by technical issues related to access to relevant, multi-domain information/knowledge, and by executive decision-making processes based predominantly on historical knowledge. Consequently, as shown by many recent incidents, the management of large-scale (mega) disasters is often inefficient and exceedingly costly. This paper demonstrates that the integration of modified information and knowledge management into the concepts of network-centric operations and network-enabled capabilities, and the employment of Boyd's OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop-based decision-making in unpredictable and dynamically changing environments, may address some of these problems.

AB BACKGROUND: Electronic syndromic surveillance for early outbreak detection may be a simple, effective tool to rapidly bring reliable and actionable outbreak data to the attention of public health authorities in the developing world.; METHODS: Twenty-nine signs and symptoms from patients with conditions compatible with infectious diseases are collected from selected Provincial hospitals and analyzed daily. Data is e-mailed on a daily basis to a central data management and analysis center. Automated data analysis may be viewed at the hospital or the Early Warning Outbreak Response System (EWORS) hub at the central level (National Institute of Health Research and Development/NIHRD).; CONCLUSION: The Indonesian Ministry of Health (MoH) has adopted EWORS since 2006 and will use it as a complementary surveillance tool in wider catchment areas throughout the country. Socialization to more users is still being conducted under collaboration of three Directorate Generals (DGs) of the MoH; DG of NIHRD, DG of Medical Services and DG of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, EWORS is being adapted to facilitate detecting a potential outbreak of pandemic influenza in the region, and automated procedures for outbreak detection have been added.

AB Informatics interventions generally take place in rapidly changing settings where many variables are outside the control of the evaluator. Assessment must be timely so that feedback can instigate modification of the intervention. Adapting a methodology from international health and epidemiology, we have developed and refined a Rapid Assessment Process (RAP) for informatics while conducting a study of clinical decision support (CDS) in community hospitals. Using RAP, we have not only been able to provide implementers with actionable feedback, but we have also discovered that users and informaticians conceptualize CDS in vastly different ways. Further understanding of this difference will be needed if we are to improve CDS acceptance by users.

AB OBJECTIVE: In agreement with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education guidelines, a systems-based practice (SBP) curriculum was implemented to provide a hands-on, team-based experience, while providing an opportunity to contribute to quality improvement, and to develop a method to assess residents' understanding of SBP.; STUDY DESIGN: During departmental conferences, issues affecting our health care operations were identified. Seven teams were formed and the actionable items were investigated. The salient issues and potential solutions were presented to the department.; RESULTS: This project resulted in the development of tools designed to assess competency in SBP, communication skills, and professionalism. Completion of a pre- and posttest and annual oral examination questions revealed a significant improvement in the comprehension of SBP.; CONCLUSION: This project served as an effective educational forum for the competencies of SBP, communication skills, and professionalism. This initiative also offered improvement of patient care and/or educating peer providers, thereby fulfilling the goal of SBP in the process of education.

AB BACKGROUND: There is evidence that pharmacist interventions improve clinical outcomes. The few studies that address economic outcomes (a) often report estimated instead of actual medical costs, (b) report only medication costs, or (c) have been conducted in settings that are not typical of community-based primary care.; OBJECTIVES: To (a) determine whether a clinical pharmacist's recommendations to physicians regarding optimizing medication therapy are related to medical costs in capitated patients in an internal medicine practice, and (b) compare what primary care physicians (PCPs) in a comparison group actually did proactively to optimize medication therapy versus what a clinical pharmacist would have recommended to them.; METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study comparing 2 internal medicine practices. Study enrollment was performed using a screening process carried out every 1-2 weeks on a rolling basis for 1 year from July 2001 through June 2002. Eligibility criteria for prospective enrollment were (a) 1 or more risk factors: at least 1 chronic disease or an event (e.g., emergency room visit, adverse drug reaction, medication nonadherence) or aged 50 years or older, (b) a scheduled visit to see a PCP within 2 weeks from the screening date or a diagnosis of diabetes without a PCP visit during the first 6 months of the study, (c) need for optimization of medication therapy as determined by a clinical pharmacist on the screening date, and (d) 12 months of continuous insurance eligibility before enrollment in the study. For inclusion in the final study analyses, patients were also required to have continuous insurance eligibility through 12 months from study enrollment. One clinical pharmacist made recommendations to optimize medication therapy in the intervention group. For the comparison group, the same pharmacist proposed recommendations that remained concealed from the physicians. The primary outcome measure was per patient per year (PPPY) medical cost, based on plan liability (gross allowable costs minus patient costs), excluding prescription drug cost. Additional outcome measures included numbers of outpatient visits, hospital admissions, emergency room (ER) visits per 1,000 patients, and hospital days; and percent of recommendations that were accepted by the PCPs. Changes in outcome measures from the pre-intervention to postintervention period were compared across study groups in a difference-indifference analysis, using the Student's t-test for normally distributed data and the Mann-Whitney U-test (nonparametric) for skewed data.; RESULTS: There were 127 and 216 adult patients in the intervention and comparison groups, respectively. The primary outcome, change in mean PPPY medical (excluding pharmacy) cost, did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.711). The between-group difference in the change in ER visits per 1,000 patients approached statistical significance (P = 0.054). Intervention group patients were more likely than comparison group patients to have the following issues addressed: medication nonadherence (85.7% vs. 40.0%, respectively; P = 0.032), untreated indication (72.6% vs. 11.5%, P < 0.001), suboptimal medication choice (60.0% vs. 5.9%, P < 0.001) and cost-ineffective drug therapies (72.1% vs. 6.5%, P < 0.001). Of the estimated number of actionable opportunities identified for the comparison group (but concealed from the physicians), 23.5% were adopted by comparison group physicians without any assistance from a clinical pharmacist.; CONCLUSION: Compared with patients of PCPs who received no input from a clinical pharmacist, patients of PCPs who received clinical pharmacist recommendations were more likely to have several medication-related issues addressed, including medication nonadherence, untreated indications, suboptimal medication choices, and cost-ineffective drug therapies. However, total medical (excluding pharmacy) costs for the intervention and comparison groups were not significantly different.

AB We have developed and field-tested a now operational civilian biodefense capability that continuously monitors the air in high-risk locations for biological threat agents. This stand-alone instrument, called the Autonomous Pathogen Detection System (APDS), collects and selectively concentrates particles from the air into liquid samples and analyzes the samples using multiplexed PCR amplification coupled with microsphere array detection. During laboratory testing, we evaluated the APDS instrument's response to Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis by spiking the liquid sample stream with viable spores and cells, bead-beaten lysates, and purified DNA extracts. APDS results were also compared to a manual real-time PCR method. Field data acquired during 74 days of continuous operation at a mass-transit subway station are presented to demonstrate the specificity and reliability of the APDS. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently selected the APDS reported herein as the first autonomous detector component of their BioWatch antiterrorism program. This sophisticated field-deployed surveillance capability now generates actionable data in one-tenth the time of manual filter collection and analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: Health care delivery teams have received much attention in recent years from researchers and practitioners. Recent empirical research has demonstrated that objective and subjective outcomes tend to be improved when care teams function smoothly and efficiently. However, little is known about how the work environment, or care context, influences team processes that lead to better outcomes.; PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to explore acute care staff's perceptions of how two components of the work environment, the ethical climate and continuous quality improvement leadership, influence teamwork and to begin to identify actionable approaches for improving teamwork. Although ethical climate influences have been studied in several sectors, research is lacking in health care.; METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A cross-sectional field study explored how the ethical climate impacted teamwork in an acute care setting and how continuous quality improvement leadership behaviors moderated the relationship between the ethical climate and teamwork.; FINDINGS: Results indicated that clinicians who perceived the ethical climate to be benevolent were significantly more likely to say that teamwork was better. Furthermore, we found that continuous quality improvement leadership styles moderated the relationship between the ethical climate and teamwork.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Although a benevolent ethical climate appears to be associated with effective teamwork, it appears that the proximate continuous quality improvement behaviors exhibited by leaders have a significant impact as well, above and beyond the climate. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To use a patient-centered approach to refine warning labels promoting the safe use of prescription drugs among patients, regardless of literacy level.; METHODS: Ten discussion groups were conducted among adults recruited from a general internal medicine clinic and four adult education classes. Participants completed face-to-face cognitive interviews with literacy assessment to determine comprehension of the 10 most commonly used drug warning labels, followed by a discussion group that solicited feedback for revising text and icons.; RESULTS: In all, 85 adults participated; 56% had limited literacy skills. Feedback from discussion groups indicated that the majority of icons were confusing, used difficult language, and text and icons were often discordant. Participants sought actionable language in the most simple and concise manner. In comprehension testing, five of the warning labels reached a set standard of >80% comprehension; the remaining labels were revised and three others modified on patients' request. A universal icon that conveyed 'Caution' was used for one label ("use only on your skin") as patients were unable to agree on an acceptable visual representation.; CONCLUSION: A patient-centered approach to designing consumer medication information could improve the comprehensibility of existing warning labels.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Pharmacies should review existing drug warnings to assess adequacy among patients, particularly those with limited literacy. Pharmacists should confirm patients understand auxiliary warnings to support safe and effective use.

AB Rhetorical acknowledgment of the value of human rights for the AIDS response continues, yet practical application of human rights principles to national efforts appears to be increasingly deficient. We assess the ways in which international and national strategic plans and other core documents take into account the commitments made by countries to uphold human rights in their efforts towards achieving Universal Access. Key documents from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) were reviewed along with 14 national HIV strategic plans chosen for their illustration of the diversity of HIV epidemic patterns, levels of income and geographical location. Whereas human rights concepts overwhelmingly appeared in both international and national strategic documents, their translation into actionable terms or monitoring frameworks was weak, unspecific or absent. Future work should analyse strategic plans, plans of operation, budgets and actual implementation so that full advantage can be taken, not only of the moral and legal value of human rights, but also their instrumental value for achieving Universal Access.

AB Conflict and post-conflict settings pose specific challenges to HIV prevention and care efforts. Whereas armed conflicts have decreased very considerably in number, the interactions between HIV epidemiology and conflict remain problematic. This review describes factors that affect HIV in conflict and post-conflict settings, identifies challenges to addressing HIV, and presents actionable and measurable programming and funding recommendations that can be implemented immediately. Funding priorities include prevention and care efforts such as the provision and monitoring of universal precautions for HIV infection, health services for sexual violence and antiretroviral therapy. Policy efforts should prioritize enforcing appropriate conduct by peacekeepers and aid workers, interventions targeted at specific phases and contexts of conflicts, supporting the continuity of programmes from emergency to post emergency and reconstruction efforts and simplifying and accelerating funding mechanisms.

AB BK virus (BKV) is the infectious cause of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy. Screening guidelines for renal-transplant recipients define levels of viremia and viruria that are actionable for additional testing or intervention. However, standardized real-time PCR primers, probes, and standards are unavailable, and the extent of agreement among published assays is unknown. We compared seven TaqMan real-time PCR primer/probe sets (three designed at this institution, three described in the literature, and one purchased) in conjunction with two different standards to prospectively measure BKV titers in 251 urine specimens submitted to our clinical laboratory. We observed substantial disagreement among assays attributable both to features of primer and probe design and to choice of reference material. The most significant source of error among individual specimens was primer or probe mismatch due to subtype-associated polymorphisms, primarily among subtype III and IV isolates. In contrast, measurement of the most abundant subtypes (Ia, V, and VI) were typically uniform among all seven assays. Finally, we describe and validate a new clinical assay designed to reliably measure all subtypes encountered in our study population (Ia, Ic, III, IV, and VI). Consideration of available BKV sequence information in conjunction with details of subtype distribution allowed us to develop a redesigned assay with markedly improved performance. These results suggest that both accurate BKV measurement and the uniform application of BKV screening guidelines could be significantly improved by the use of standardized reference materials and PCR primers and probes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Poor medication adherence is widespread among patients with chronic conditions requiring long-term drug therapy. Medication adherence is determined by multiple patient-, context-, and therapy-dependent factors. This paper describes the development and initial validation of the ASK-20 survey, created to identify actionable risk factors for medication nonadherence and to improve communication about adherence.; METHODS: A pool of 30 items was generated through comprehensive literature review. Items were refined and the item pool was expanded through an expert panel review and patient focus groups to yield 47 candidate items, each with five response options ranging from either Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree or from In the Last Week to Never. The pool of 47 candidate items was administered to a web-based sample of 605 patients taking medications and reporting a diagnosis of asthma, diabetes, or depression for psychometric testing and item reduction.; RESULTS: Eleven multi-item factor groupings with two additional unique items were identified on the basis of principal components analysis and interpretability. Twenty (20) items representing ten factor groupings were selected for the final instrument. Each of the final items was dichotomized as positive - indicating a barrier, or negative. Two summary scores - the sum of all positive barriers or Total Barrier Count (TBC) and the sum of raw item scores, the ASK-20 score - were calculated. Concurrent validity of the dichotomously scored individual items, the TBC and ASK-20 scores in relation to self-reported adherence was generally good. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.77 for the TBC and 0.85 for the ASK-20 score.; CONCLUSIONS: ASK-20 consists of 20 clinically actionable items representing multiple factors that affect medication adherence. The ASK-20 survey demonstrated satisfactory validity and internal consistency and may be used to identify actionable barriers to adherence across a spectrum of chronic diseases. Future research using more objective measures of adherence is warranted to confirm the exploratory validity and reliability of ASK-20 reported in this study.

AB The news media are a primary source of cancer prevention and detection information for the general public, but little is known about the content of cancer prevention and detection messages in mainstream media. This study examines how cancer prevention and screening efficacy messages are presented in cancer news media coverage. Efficacy messages provide information about skills related to prevention and screening behaviors. Analysis of cancer-related stories in 44 major US daily newspapers during 2003 (n = 2448) reveals that efficacy messages were rarely present in cancer stories. Efficacy messages were less likely to appear in stories that had a 'local' angle, but efficacy messages were more likely to appear in stories that contained 'mobilizing information' (additional resources for readers) or stories that mentioned highly preventable cancers (lung, skin, esophagus and bladder). The discussion includes a theory of norms for effectively influencing cancer-related behaviors through news reports. Implications of this work extend to the lack of efficacy messages when highly detectable cancers are mentioned, thus the lack of actionable information when health risks are presented, and a dearth of efficacy messages when localized information is present, each of which represent key areas for encouraging health journalists to include more efficacy statements.

AB Evaluation of: Mallal S, Phillips E, CarosiG etal.: HLA-B*5701 screening for hypersensitivity to abacavir. N. Engl. J. Med. 358, 568-579 (2008). The field of pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine took a leap forward with publication of a recent multicenter global study, in which prospective trial results clearly validated the use of pharmacogenetic testing in avoiding a drug toxicity reaction. In a study of over 1900 HIV-1-infected patients, HLA-B*5701 screening prior to administering an abacavir-containing regimen, with avoidance of the antiretroviral abacavir in HLA-B*5701-positive patients, was shown to be a highly effective pharmacogenetic test. The screening test provided a clear actionable result with a perfect negative predictive value-100% of hypersensitivity reactions were prevented by the application of the screening test. This article summarizes the study, compares the findings to previous publications on this topic and discusses factors that impact translating research developments in pharmacogenetics into widespread community practice.

AB Chronic disease management has been a rapidly growing entity in the 21st century as a strategy for managing chronic illnesses in large populations. However, experience has shown that disease management programs have not been able to demonstrate their financial value. The objectives of disease management programs are to create quality benchmarks, such as principles and guidelines, and to establish a uniform set of metrics and a standardized methodology for evaluating them. In order to illuminate the essence of disease management and its components, as well as the complexity and the problematic nature of performing economic calculations of their profitability and value, we collected data from several reports that dealt with the economic intervention of disease management programs. The disease management economic evaluation is composed of a series of steps, including the following major categories: data/information technology, information generation, assessment/recommendations, actionable customer plans, and program assessment/reassessment. We demonstrate the elements necessary for economic analysis. Disease management is one of the most innovative tools in the managed care environment and is still in the process of being defined. Therefore, objectives should include the creation of quality measures, such as principles and guidelines, and the establishment of a uniform set of metrics and a standardized methodology for evaluating them.

AB BACKGROUND: Each year, greater than a half million people die of cancer in the U.S. Despite progress in increasing access to palliative oncology services, end-of-life care still needs improvement. Measuring the quality of the end-of-life experience is difficult because of patient debility and reduced consciousness as death approaches. Family proxies have been proposed as valuable informants regarding the quality of end-of-life care. This article describes family proxy perspectives concerning care at the end of life in patients who died of advanced cancer.; METHODS: In the context of a novel outpatient palliative care demonstration project, 125 family proxy respondents completed a structured survey by telephone 3 months to 6 months after the patient's death from breast, lung, or gastrointestinal cancer. Four key quality of care indicators were measured: decision-making and physician communication, location of death, hospice involvement, and end-of-life symptoms.; RESULTS: Proxies reported that 78% to 81% of patients completed at least 1 form of advance directive and approximately half of them were helpful in guiding care. Communication with physicians regarding end-of-life treatment wishes occurred in 67% of cases, but only 57% of the patients actually made a plan with their physician to ensure that their wishes were followed. The majority of patients died in their location of choice, most often at home, and greater than half had hospice involvement for an average of 41.8 days before death. During the last week of life, the majority of patients experienced troublesome physical and emotional symptoms.; CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of proxy perspectives is feasible as an indicator of the quality of end-of-life care, and the results of the current study provide actionable data for areas of improvement in palliative oncology care.

AB BACKGROUND: Although pacemakers are primarily used for the treatment of bradycardia, diagnostic data available in current pacemakers allow them to be also used as sophisticated, continuous monitoring devices. Easy access to these stored data may assist clinicians in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions sooner, thus avoiding potential long-term sequelae due to untreated clinical disorders. Internet-based remote device interrogation systems provide clinicians with frequent and complete access to stored data in pacemakers. In addition to monitoring device function, remote monitors may be a helpful tool in assisting physicians in the management of common arrhythmia disorders.; METHODS: The Pacemaker REmote Follow-up Evaluation and Review (PREFER) trial is a prospective, randomized, parallel, unblinded, multicenter, open label clinical trial to determine the utility of remote pacemaker interrogation in the earlier diagnosis of clinically actionable events compared to the existing practice of transtelephonic monitoring. There have been 980 patients enrolled and randomized to receive pacemaker follow up with either remote interrogation using the Medtronic CareLink(R) Network (CareLink) versus the conventional method of transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) in addition to periodic in-person interrogation and programming evaluations. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the design of the PREFER trial. The results, to be presented separately, will characterize the number of clinically actionable events as a result of pacemaker follow-up using remote interrogation instead of TTM.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00294645.

AB The inescapable conclusion of a just a decade of nutrigenomics research must now be brought to practice. Humans differ in their responses to diet and many of these differences are being assigned to genetic polymorphisms. However, differences in the varying responses to diet between humans are not solely because of genetic variation. Lifestage, lifestyle, prior nutritional and physiological variables and even your mother's microflora all influence the differences between humans. The question becomes: are all of these inputs to an individual's health measurable as part of a nutritional phenotype assessment? The answer to this question is increasingly, yes. As variations in humans can be both measured and even more importantly understood, the implications of those measures to dietary guidance become actionable. More accurate assessment of the inputs to human health and the consequences of those inputs measured as accurate proteomic and metabolomic analyses would bring personalized health to practice far faster than waiting for a predictive knowledge of genetic variation.

AB BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS resource allocation decisions are influenced by political, social, ethical and other factors that are difficult to quantify. Consequently, quantitative models of HIV/AIDS resource allocation have had limited impact on actual spending decisions. We propose a decision-support System for HIV/AIDS Resource Allocation (S4HARA) that takes into consideration both principles of efficient resource allocation and the role of non-quantifiable influences on the decision-making process for resource allocation.; METHODS: S4HARA is a four-step spreadsheet-based model. The first step serves to identify the factors currently influencing HIV/AIDS allocation decisions. The second step consists of prioritizing HIV/AIDS interventions. The third step involves allocating the budget to the HIV/AIDS interventions using a rational approach. Decision-makers can select from several rational models of resource allocation depending on availability of data and level of complexity. The last step combines the results of the first and third steps to highlight the influencing factors that act as barriers or facilitators to the results suggested by the rational resource allocation approach. Actionable recommendations are then made to improve the allocation. We illustrate S4HARA in the context of a primary healthcare clinic in South Africa.; RESULTS: The clinic offers six types of HIV/AIDS interventions and spends US$750,000 annually on these programs. Current allocation decisions are influenced by donors, NGOs and the government as well as by ethical and religious factors. Without additional funding, an optimal allocation of the total budget suggests that the portion allotted to condom distribution be increased from 1% to 15% and the portion allotted to prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections be increased from 43% to 71%, while allocation to other interventions should decrease.; CONCLUSION: Condom uptake at the clinic should be increased by changing the condom distribution policy from a pull system to a push system. NGOs and donors promoting antiretroviral programs at the clinic should be sensitized to the results of the model and urged to invest in wellness programs aimed at the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections. S4HARA differentiates itself from other decision support tools by providing rational HIV/AIDS resource allocation capabilities as well as consideration of the realities facing authorities in their decision-making process.

AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this multicenter, multireader study was to evaluate the performance of computed tomography (CT) lung nodule computer-aided detection (CAD) software as a second reader.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study involved 109 patients from four sites. The data were collected from a variety of multidetector CT scanners and had different scan parameters. Each chest CT scan was divided into four quadrants. A group of three expert thoracic radiologists identified nodules between 4 and 30 mm in maximum diameter within each quadrant. The standard of reference was established by a consensus read of these experienced radiologists. The cases were then interpreted by 10 other radiologist readers with varying degrees of experience, without and then with CAD software. These readers identified nodules and assigned an actionability rating to each quadrant before and after using CAD software. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to measure the performance of the readers without and with CAD software.; RESULTS: The average increase in area under the curve for the 10 readers with CAD software was 1.9% for a 95% confidence interval (0.8-8.0%). The area under the curve without CAD software was 86.7% and with CAD software was 88.7%. A nonsignificant correlation was observed between the improvement in sensitivity and experience of the radiologists. The readers also showed a greater improvement in patients with cancer as compared to those without cancer.; CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter trial, CAD software was shown to be effective as a second reader by improving the sensitivity of the radiologists in detecting pulmonary nodules.

AB Patterns embedded in large volumes of clinical data may provide important insights into the characteristics of patients or care delivery processes, but may be difficult to identify by traditional means. Data mining offers methods that can recognize patterns in these large data sets and make them actionable. We present an example of this capability in which we successfully applied data mining to hospital infection control. The Data Mining Surveillance System (DMSS) uses data from the clinical laboratory and hospital information systems to create association rules linking patients, sample types, locations, organisms, and antibiotic susceptibilities. Changes in association strength over time signal epidemiologic patterns potentially appropriate for follow-up, and additional heuristic methods identify the most informative of these patterns for alerting.

AB As radiology departments transition to near-complete digital information management, work flows and their supporting informatics infrastructure are becoming increasingly complex. Digital dashboards can integrate separate computerized information systems and summarize key work flow metrics in real time to facilitate informed decision making. A PACS-integrated digital dashboard function designed to alert radiologists to their unsigned report queue status, coupled with an actionable link to the report signing application, resulted in a 24% reduction in the time between transcription and report finalization. The dashboard was well received by radiologists who reported high usage for signing reports. Further research is needed to identify and evaluate other potentially useful work flow metrics for inclusion in a radiology clinical dashboard.

AB Despite aggressive research aimed at understanding the myriad biochemical factors that are integrated to balance energy intake and expenditure to maintain normal body weight, obesity is increasing at an alarming rate, and the long-term success of prevention and intervention strategies is minimal. Because much of the scientific literature addressing obesity has originated with rodent models, there is considerable interest among researchers and funding agencies in the development of comparative animal models. Furthermore, numerous disparate results between rodent models and humans (i.e., adipsin, leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and other adipokines) have hindered the translation of rodent data into actionable technologies for humans. The pig is an exceptional restenosis model, and is emerging rapidly as a biomedical model for energy metabolism and obesity in humans because it is devoid of brown fat postnatally and because of their similar metabolic features, cardiovascular systems, and proportional organ sizes. This article highlights the current literature devoted to the development of porcine models for obesity and the metabolic syndrome, with a particular emphasis on the role of adipose tissue and adipokines in the regulation of energy balance and the inflammation associated with obesity.

AB BACKGROUND: The indexing of scientific literature and content is a relevant and contemporary requirement within life science information systems. Navigating information available in legacy formats continues to be a challenge both in enterprise and academic domains. The emergence of semantic web technologies and their fusion with artificial intelligence techniques has provided a new toolkit with which to address these data integration challenges. In the emerging field of lipidomics such navigation challenges are barriers to the translation of scientific results into actionable knowledge, critical to the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's syndrome, Mycobacterium infections and cancer.; RESULTS: We present a literature-driven workflow involving document delivery and natural language processing steps generating tagged sentences containing lipid, protein and disease names, which are instantiated to custom designed lipid ontology. We describe the design challenges in capturing lipid nomenclature, the mandate of the ontology and its role as query model in the navigation of the lipid bibliosphere. We illustrate the extent of the description logic-based A-box query capability provided by the instantiated ontology using a graphical query composer to query sentences describing lipid-protein and lipid-disease correlations.; CONCLUSION: As scientists accept the need to readjust the manner in which we search for information and derive knowledge we illustrate a system that can constrain the literature explosion and knowledge navigation problems. Specifically we have focussed on solving this challenge for lipidomics researchers who have to deal with the lack of standardized vocabulary, differing classification schemes, and a wide array of synonyms before being able to derive scientific insights. The use of the OWL-DL variant of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and description logic reasoning is pivotal in this regard, providing the lipid scientist with advanced query access to the results of text mining algorithms instantiated into the ontology. The visual query paradigm assists in the adoption of this technology.

AB The world-wide incidence of cancer is expected to increase to 20 million by 2020. 70% of new cases occur in countries with 5% of the global cancer control resources. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in high income, as well as low and middle income countries (LMCs). For the leading pharmaceutical companies, the current market for breast cancer systemic therapy (BCST) in LMCs is likely to decline in the future due to increasing costs of novel drugs. Breast cancer provides a strong example for multiple drug management of solid tumors. Development of economically sustainable scientific strategies for BCST in LMCs could improve affordability of therapy for other cancers throughout the world. Examples of recent and ongoing studies using protocols that could decrease costs of treatment without compromising outcomes are reviewed. The Win-Win initiative proposed by ICEDOC's (International Campaign for Establishment and Development of Oncology Centers) Experts in Cancer without Borders starts with small pilot meetings for oncologists with key stakeholders, including leading pharmaceutical companies. The participants would develop a roadmap for actionable strategies for crafting affordable BCST tailored to regional conditions and the diverse populations of women with breast cancer.

AB Cardiac rehabilitation is a key component of the comprehensive care of the 79.4 million adults in the United States with one or more forms of cardiovascular disease. Only a fraction of eligible candidates complete cardiac rehabilitation and women are at a significantly higher risk for underutilizing this safe and effective secondary prevention intervention. This article reviews the complex array of barriers to cardiac rehabilitation, with a focus on those factors that are unique to women. The Healthcare Utilization Model is used as a theoretical framework to categorize these barriers into environmental, physician, and patient level categories. These barriers, although challenging for both patients and healthcare professionals, provide opportunities for change. Actionable evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals include making changes in health policy, using proven performance improvement methodologies to increase referral and enrollment, using interdisciplinary models of communication, and enhancing cardiac rehabilitation program attributes reflective of women's preferences and needs.

AB Current regulatory guidelines related to pharmaceutical risk minimization put most emphasis on risk communication and control of the use of drugs. Little, if any, consideration is given to those aspects of an adverse drug reaction that ultimately determine whether the risk can be minimized. However, this limited scope is unfortunate and could prevent risk minimization activities from improving drug use safety. This article attempts to present an overview of possible elements of pharmaceutical risk minimization and to place these in a framework. The promotion of drug safety through risk communication and control of use should be advanced, with more attention to actionable and evidence-based guidance relating to the 'pretreatment evaluation', and in particular the 'on-treatment management' of the patient.

AB BACKGROUND: A study was conducted to explore the value and limitations of voluntary medical error reports and to learn about common errors in warfarin use.; METHODS: Voluntary reports of 8,837 inpatient errors and 820 outpatient errors in warfarin use submitted by 445 hospitals and 192 outpatient facilities participating in MEDMARX, a voluntary medication error reporting system, from 2002 to 2004, were gathered.; RESULTS: Overall, errors occurred most often during transcription/documentation (35%) and administration (30%) in hospitals, and during prescribing (31%) and dispensing (39%) in outpatient settings. Dosing errors were the most common type. In hospitals, more than 50% of reported errors were initiated by nurses, and 50% were intercepted by nurses, whereas in outpatient settings, about 50% of reported errors occurred in pharmacies and 50% were intercepted by pharmacists. About 17% of inpatient and 13% of outpatient warfarin errors resulted in changes in patient care, and 42% of inpatient and 62% of outpatient errors resulted in procedural changes. Cascade analysis and textual descriptions further located specific, correctible safety lapses.; DISCUSSION: Voluntary medical error reporting systems can, to some extent, provide meaningful and actionable information to guide patient safety improvement, but their usefulness is limited because of a lack of details, incomplete reporting, underreporting, and various reporting biases.

AB Wireless technology enables clinicians to continuously monitor their patients' conditions remotely. This allows doctors to leverage data to make informed decisions and interventions with immediacy, thereby reducing or eliminating hospital stays, driving down costs and improving outcomes. Remote monitoring initiatives rely on a sophisticated end-to-end IT infrastructure that encompasses wireless sensors and mobile telecommunications devices as well as middleware and business intelligence capabilities to provide a faster response loop, greater visibility and an extensible and scalable framework. This article explores the potential of wireless remote monitoring to improve care and reduce the cost of chronic disease management in an aging and mobile population. The article will also discuss the IT infrastructure and operational requirements needed to ensure that data from remote sensors can be quickly translated into actionable information.

AB Effectively determining the future return-on-investment of regional healthcare delivery and electronic healthcare record systems requires consideration of many alternative designs for their performance, cost and ability to meet stakeholder expectations. Successfully testing, validating and communicating the expected consequences of alternative business practices, processes, protocols and policies requires an objective analytical approach. Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS), a technique for determining the system-level results of complex, interacting, and often conflicting individual-level decisions, provides such an approach. ABMS of healthcare delivery can provide actionable guidance for decision makers by enabling healthcare experts to define the individual, agent-level rules of operation; allowing them to see how the agent rules play out over time in a detailed real-world context; providing them with the tools to assess the consequences of alternative plans; and giving them a clear method for communicating results to the broader stakeholder community.

AB OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of individual terminology systems should be driven in part by the intended usages of such systems. Clinical interface terminologies support interactions between healthcare providers and computer-based applications. They aid practitioners in converting clinical "free text" thoughts into the structured, formal data representations used internally by application programs. Interface terminologies also serve the important role of presenting existing stored, encoded data to end users in human-understandable and actionable formats. The authors present a model for evaluating functional utility of interface terminologies based on these intended uses.; DESIGN: Specific parameters defined in the manuscript comprise the metrics for the evaluation model.; MEASUREMENTS: Parameters include concept accuracy, term expressivity, degree of semantic consistency for term construction and selection, adequacy of assertional knowledge supporting concepts, degree of complexity of pre-coordinated concepts, and the "human readability" of the terminology. The fundamental metric is how well the interface terminology performs in supporting correct, complete, and efficient data encoding or review by humans.; RESULTS: Authors provide examples demonstrating performance of the proposed evaluation model in selected instances.; CONCLUSION: A formal evaluation model will permit investigators to evaluate interface terminologies using a consistent and principled approach. Terminology developers and evaluators can apply the proposed model to identify areas for improving interface terminologies.

AB PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The intent of this article is to explain predictive modeling-a statistical tool-as it applies to the practice of case management. While actuaries and financial experts focus on the statistical relevance of predictive risk scores, case managers will benefit from knowing what these scores mean and how interpreting and applying them into meaningful action can lead to improved patient outcomes.; PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Predictive modeling can be used by physician practice groups, managed care organizations, worksite wellness programs, and any organization desiring to identify the most actionable population for targeted outreach, education, and management.; FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Predictive modeling is a technological tool that functions as an electronic claims canvasser searching for predefined variables of interest. This tool is used to identify high-cost diagnoses that, in turn, provide a risk score indicative of the likelihood to utilize more healthcare resources and dollars than persons of the same age and gender. By targeting specific diagnoses or conditions, clinicians can define precise patient interventions such as appointment reminders, weight checks, and dietary compliance; assess the intended results of prescribed medications, or simply to provide education and support. The validation of predictive modeling's true value lies in the thorough evaluation of the outcomes of these interventions. The success of predictive modeling can be demonstrated only by a combination of specific data and evidence-based intervention leading to improved models of healthcare delivery and improved patient outcomes.; IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Using predictive models, case managers will be able to target the most actionable patients who will benefit from targeted outreach and education. Case managers will gain an understanding of how a numerical value can lead to the development of a comprehensive collaborative care plan with the patient and other members of the interdisciplinary team to not only improve the patient's overall health status but to engage the patient in his or her own care, empowering the patient to take responsibility for his or her own health status.

AB OBJECTIVE: Improving depression treatment is critical given low rates of appropriate care. Health plan performance measures that address quality of antidepressant medication management, specifically, have been stagnating at relatively low levels. Identifying health plan characteristics associated with better performance could contribute to quality improvement for this aspect of depression treatment.; METHODS: Data for 2003 were linked from two sources: a nationally representative survey of 368 health plans about their behavioral health services and the National Committee for Quality Assurance's Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) antidepressant medication management (AMM) scores, which reflect the percentage of eligible members whose care met specified criteria. The analytic sample present in both data sets totaled 361 products offered by 183 plans. Plan characteristics were grouped into organizational, provider, and consumer domains. Bivariate tests and regression analyses were conducted to estimate the relationship between these characteristics and health plan performance on three AMM measures: effective acute-phase treatment, effective continuation-phase treatment, and optimal practitioner contact.; RESULTS: Mean HEDIS AMM scores were 60% for effective acute-phase treatment, 43% for continuation-phase treatment, and 22% for optimal practitioner contact. Individual feedback to clinicians about their performance, lower cost sharing for outpatient mental health, and greater access to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were significantly associated with better plan performance in terms of antidepressant medication management.; CONCLUSIONS: Health plan characteristics were significantly associated with the quality of one important aspect of depression care, antidepressant medication management. Many of the factors that were identified suggest actionable ways for plans to improve quality of depression care.

AB PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the sensitivity of and number of false-positive marks made by a commercially available computer-aided detection (CAD) system for identifying lung cancers previously missed on chest radiographs by radiologists, with histopathologic results as the reference standard.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study; the requirement for informed patient consent was waived. A CAD nodule detection program was applied to 34 posteroanterior digital chest radiographs obtained in 34 patients (21 men, 13 women; mean age, 69 years). All 34 radiographs showed a nodular lung cancer that was apparent in retrospect but had not been mentioned in the report. Two radiologists identified these radiologist-missed cancers on the chest radiographs and graded them for visibility, location, subtlety (extremely subtle to extremely obvious on a 10-point scale), and actionability (actionable or not actionable according to whether the radiologists probably would have recommended follow-up if the nodule had been detected). The CAD results were analyzed to determine the numbers of cancers and false-positive nodules marked and to correlate the CAD results with the nodule grades for subtlety and actionability. The chi2 test or Fisher exact test for independence was used to compare CAD sensitivity between the very subtle (grade 1-3) and relatively obvious (grade > 3) cancers and between the actionable and not actionable cancers.; RESULTS: The CAD program had an overall sensitivity of 35% (12 of 34 cancers), identifying seven (30%) of 23 very subtle and five (45%) of 11 relatively obvious radiologist-missed cancers (P = .21) and detecting two (25%) of eight missed not actionable and ten (38%) of 26 missed actionable cancers (P = .33). The CAD program made an average of 5.9 false-positive marks per radiograph.; CONCLUSION: The described CAD system can mark a substantial proportion of visually subtle lung cancers that are likely to be missed by radiologists.

AB The Danubian Biobank Consortium (www.danubianbiobank.de) was initiated in 2005 as a network of Danube Universities and associated partner universities between Ulm and Budapest, with a major focus on case/control studies of aging disorders like vascular and metabolic diseases, Type2-diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond case/control studies some centers also directly participate in longitudinal population based studies and population isolate studies or provide enabling technologies for these studies. The mission of the Danubian Biobank Consortium is to directly integrate biobanking into local and regional healthcare along the Danube through E-health portal structures and IT-based strategies. Biobanking as an integral part of the workflow of the healthcare process is considered as key element to generate qualified long term patient databases and health records. The major objective of the project is to generate a common central encrypted patient and sample information database to facilitate international research interactions, combined with local and regional biobanking facilities under common Good Practice (GP) and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) conditions to move existing healthcare systems towards personalized healthcare. This process will be driven by local E-health portal implementation to network healthcare providers, industry, insurance companies, medical research and public healthcare in a Private Public Partnership (PPP) model to cover jointly the expenses. All information including patient recruitment, blood withdrawal and storage place of the samples will be saved in phase I as standardized processing procedures (SPP) to implement a central IT-based databank in phase II, which can be used in encrypted form for scientific project planning and investigations. In the local E-health portals the actionable health information will be also accessible for direct medical care for the authorized practitioner. In addition to local centers three regional DNA, plasma, and tissue banks in Regensburg, Vienna, and Budapest store samples and encrypted patient data for scientific purposes.

AB Despite spending a substantial amount of time in structured educational settings during early medical training, most physicians will spend the majority of their career in clinical practice. In the clinical practice setting, physicians become responsible for determining and implementing their own educational program in order to maintain, at a minimum, competence. Pressure to change the nature of continuing medical education (CME) parallels pressure from patients, payers, and policymakers to hold individual physicians more accountable for the care they provide. How can these two forces be brought together more deliberately and effectively? Comprehensive physician assessment provides such an opportunity with the potential to benefit all parties involved in health care, especially patients and physicians.Many assessment methods and tools exist today that can facilitate the integration of CME and quality. Using a multifaceted physician-level performance assessment system has substantial potential to align the public's need and desire to ensure their physician is competent, at a minimum, with providing the physician with meaningful, actionable information and data to improve performance and engage in transformative learning. CME programs need to incorporate more robust assessment as part of the learning activity to facilitate improvements in health care more directly.

AB INTRODUCTION: Greater than 500,000 doses of high-alert medications are administered throughout the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Program on an annual basis. High-alert medications (HAM) carry a higher risk of harm than other medications and errors in the administration of HAM can have catastrophic clinical outcomes. The purpose of this project is to ensure safe medication practices and to eliminate medication errors that cause harm to our patients.The Program: KPNC leadership, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, quality leaders, and labor unions worked with regional and local medication safety committees to: 1) standardize high-alert medication-handling practices; 2) enhance education programs related to medication practices, embedding these into annual core competencies of all staff who handle high-alert medications; 3) develop monitoring functions at both the regional and local levels to ensure sustainability and ongoing systems improvements. Begun in December 2005, this program covers the delivery of high-alert medications across the continuum of care and affects all patients receiving HAM.; MEASURES: The initial phase of the monitoring process was put in place to measure compliance with implementation. Over the first few months of the program the 90% minimal threshold was surpassed with regional overall compliance of 95%. Following this initial process, the Regional Medication Safety Committee developed monitoring tools. Department managers carry out these concurrent observational audits at the medical centers with oversight by the Assistant Administrators for Quality and Service. These audits are designed to measure whether or not all medications on the HAM list are handled specifically to policy requirements, eg, independent double-checks, HAM stickers, etc. Audit specifications are provided for each audit tool. Medical Center audit results from the third quarter of 2006 through the third quarter of 2007 have shown a regional aggregate of 97.7% compliance. As the high percentages of compliance have held constant over time, more actionable metrics are being put in place for 2008.To determine whether or not the program is reducing HAM errors, data from the regional Quality and Risk database (MIDAS) related to all high-alert medication errors was reviewed. Two interventions were of note: in July of 2005, there was a renewed effort to educate leaders, managers, physicians, and staff on responsible reporting in a "just culture" and the introduction of the new Responsible Reporting Form. An increase in reporting was noted at this time. In December 2005, the HAM program was introduced. There is a statistically significant drop in errors reported for 23 consecutive months following this program. These findings were similar for all phases of the delivery process. A powerful indicator of improvement is the average days between major injury and death. As of November 30, 2007, it has been 232 days since the last significant negative event was reported due to a HAM.; CONCLUSION: This program has been implemented in all of the KPNC Medical Centers and is in the process of being implemented in all KP regions. This spread has been endorsed by the Medical Directors Quality Committee and by the KP Boards of Directors. The Interregional Medication Safety Committee is overseeing the spread process. A toolkit containing all of the required tools plus additional materials and information has been developed and made available throughout KP. The program is the recipient of the 2007 Lawrence Patient Safety Award.

AB The establishment of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) is part of management process that results in the institution of watershed-based controls of otherwise unregulated sources of pollution. In California (USA), the implementation of a TMDL is driven forward in a process where watershed stakeholders are expected to cooperate on actions needed to improve ecosystem health. In the TMDL process, methods are needed for synthesizing complex scientific data into actionable management information. Where pollutant load analysis may be misleading or perceived as unfair, non-parametric statistical methods can be applied to flow and water quality data to guide the selection of drainages for remediation. The calculation of normalized rank means (NRMs) for flow and water quality can be used to set priorities for the implementation of TMDL management actions. Drainages can be classified into one of four categories (quadrants) based on the relationship between flow and water quality NRMs. Drainages can be included or excluded from management action based on their quadrant classification. Although there are many possible alternative approaches, this "quadrant analysis" is suggested as a scientifically rigorous methods for identifying priority watersheds in the often contentious, stakeholder driven TMDL implementation process.

AB Modern molecular nutrition focuses on health promotion, disease prevention and performance improvement through diet. In analogy to Pharmacogenetics and -genomics, the disciplines "Nutrigenetics" and "Nutrigenomics" have evolved. Nutrigenetics asks how individual genetic disposition, manifesting as single-nucleotide- and copy-number polymorphisms as well as epigenetic regulation, affects susceptibility to diet. Nutrigenomics addresses the inverse relationship, i.e. how diet influences gene transcription, protein expression and metabolism. The long-term objective of Nutrigenomics is personalised nutrition for maintenance and improvement of individual health and for disease prevention. Transcriptomics can put Proteomics- and Metabonomics-derived markers into a larger biological perspective. Metabonomics is a diagnostic tool for metabolic classification of individuals with the asset of quantitative, non-invasive analysis of easily accessible human body fluids such as urine, blood and saliva. This feature also applies to some extent to Proteomics, with the constraint that the latter discipline is more complex in terms of composition and dynamic range of the sample. Apart from addressing the most complex "Ome", Proteomics represents the only platform that delivers not only markers for disposition and efficacy but also targets of intervention. Application of integrated Omic technologies will drive the understanding of interrelated pathways in healthy and pathological conditions and will help to define molecular 'switchboards', necessary to develop disease related biomarkers. This will contribute to the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for both pharmacological and nutritional interventions. This paper reviews inflammatory gut disorders, the state-of-the-art of the three Omics platforms and discusses the implication of the latter in biomarker revelation for nutritionally actionable inflammatory disorders in the intestine.

AB BACKGROUND: Health-care systems need actionable information on amputation rates in order to improve foot-care delivery.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate regional variation in total, major, and minor amputation rates using individual-level data.; METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of Veterans Health Administration users with diabetes who were Medicare enrolled between fiscal years 1998 and 2000 (10/1/1997-9/30/2000). The outcome was outlier status, based upon observed-to-expected ratios, for total, major, and minor amputations of 22 regional networks in fiscal year 2000.; RESULTS: 331,806 patients incurred a total of 4,037 (12.2 per 1000; range 9.3-16.7 across networks) amputations in fiscal year 2000: 2,271 major amputations (6.8 per 1000; 4.7-9.1) and 1,766 minor amputations (5.3 per 1000; 3.9-7.6). All network outliers based upon the total amputation observed-to-expected ratio were also outliers based on major amputation observed-to-expected ratio. However, two of the five non-outliers based on total amputations were outliers based on major amputations. Simultaneous evaluation of major and minor amputation observed-to-expected ratios demonstrated four patterns of dual outlier status among networks: two networks had lower than expected minor and major amputation rates; two had higher than expected minor and major amputation rates; one network was lower than expected by major but higher by minor amputation rate; one was higher than expected by major but lower by minor amputation rate.; CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous evaluation of major and minor amputation rates identifies different patterns of regional outlier status compared to total or major amputation rates alone. This strategy may facilitate targeted evaluations of health-care processes and structures.

AB Physicians and other caregivers have articulated concerns about the completeness and focus of the current set of ambulatory care quality measures. In this commentary, we review some of the reasons why our current measures are not as useful, reliable, and accurate as they should be and examine the 2 major barriers to improvement: lack of adequate funding for formulation, development, and testing; and gaps in the completeness and adequacy of the current data sources. We explore some promising directions, including (1) measures of misuse and overuse, (2) measures of appropriateness and quality of procedures, (3) measures that are more directly actionable, (4) measures that are more nuanced and patient centered, and finally (5) measures that make full use of the added information in fully interoperable electronic health records. With modest private and public funding for comparative studies and consensus guideline development, formulation, and testing, and with the relatively rapid transformation taking place in current data systems, it is possible to move well beyond the rather limited, but still important, measures we currently have.

AB BACKGROUND: Although the study of research utilization is not new, there has been increased emphasis on the topic over the recent past. Science push models that are researcher driven and controlled and demand pull models emphasizing users/decision-maker interests have largely been abandoned in favour of more interactive models that emphasize linkages between researchers and decisionmakers. However, despite these and other theoretical and empirical advances in the area of research utilization, there remains a fundamental gap between the generation of research findings and the application of those findings in practice.; METHODS: Using a case approach, the current study looks at the impact of one particular interaction approach to research translation used by a Canadian funding agency.; RESULTS: Results suggest there may be certain conditions under which different levels of decisionmaker involvement in research will be more or less effective. Four attributes are illuminated by the current case study: stakeholder diversity, addressability/actionability of results, finality of study design and methodology, and politicization of results. Future research could test whether these or other variables can be used to specify some of the conditions under which different approaches to interaction in knowledge translation are likely to facilitate research utilization.; CONCLUSION: This work suggests that the efficacy of interaction approaches to research translation may be more limited than current theory proposes and underscores the need for more completely specified models of research utilization that can help address the slow pace of change in this area.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe a new, rigorous, comprehensive practice-based evidence for clinical practice improvement (PBE-CPI) study methodology, and compare its features, advantages, and disadvantages to those of randomized controlled trials and sophisticated statistical methods for comparative effectiveness research.; RESEARCH DESIGN: PBE-CPI incorporates natural variation within data from routine clinical practice to determine what works, for whom, when, and at what cost. It uses the knowledge of front-line caregivers, who develop study questions and define variables as part of a transdisciplinary team. Its comprehensive measurement framework provides a basis for analyses of significant bivariate and multivariate associations between treatments and outcomes, controlling for patient differences, such as severity of illness.; RESULTS: PBE-CPI studies can uncover better practices more quickly than randomized controlled trials or sophisticated statistical methods, while achieving many of the same advantages. We present examples of actionable findings from PBE-CPI studies in postacute care settings related to comparative effectiveness of medications, nutritional support approaches, incontinence products, physical therapy activities, and other services.; CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes improved when practices associated with better outcomes in PBE-CPI analyses were adopted in practice.

Since 2005, the Medical Situational Awareness in the Theater Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration has exploited advances in information technology, geographic information systems, and open systems architecture to produce a functioning prototype of a medical situational enhancement capability. In May 2006, this prototype supported the medical staff of a combined/joint task force in a realistic command postexercise featuring a simulated outbreak of influenza during Exercise COBRA GOLD in Thailand. The proliferation and maturation of geographic information systems present many opportunities for the military medical community to improve the health of the populations for which it is responsible.

AB Tropical forest habitat continues to decline globally, with serious negative consequences for environmental sustainability. The small mountain country of Nepal provides an excellent context in which to examine trajectories of forest-cover change. Despite having experienced large-scale forest clearing in the past, significant reforestation has taken place in recent years. The range of biophysical and ecological environments and diversity of tenure arrangements provide us with a context with sufficient variation to be able to derive insight into the impact of a range of hypothesized drivers of forest change. This article draws on a dataset of 55 forests from the middle hills and Terai plains of Nepal to examine the factors associated with forest clearing or regeneration. Results affirm the central importance of tenure regimes and local monitoring for forest regrowth. In addition, user group size per unit of forest area is an important, independent explanator of forest change. These variables also can be associated with specific practices that further influence forest change such as the management of social conflict, adoption of new technologies to reduce pressure on the forest, and involvement of users in forest maintenance activities. Such large-N, comparative studies are essential if we are to derive more complex, nuanced, yet actionable frameworks that help us to plan better policies for the management of natural resources.

AB PURPOSE: A pharmacy dashboard was developed and implemented to identify trends in drug use; normalize data for patient volumes; allow the user to determine whether changes were due to cost increases, actual use changes, or both; permit evaluation of drug use within key diagnoses for individual services; and allow multiple formats and layers of analysis.; SUMMARY: At the University of Michigan, a drug cost and drug-use database had been developed, and an enterprise data warehouse had been implemented. The data warehouse served as the core data source for the pharmacy dashboard effort. The department of pharmacy services worked with the clinical information and decision support services (CIDSS) unit to develop and promote the use of the pharmacy dashboard. On the basis of the core data in the data warehouse, the dashboard was designed to harness these data for the useful and actionable presentation to service chiefs, individual house officers, and administration for a better understanding of drug costs and use within the institution. In addition to the drug cost and drug-use trend data, the dashboard included help features such as access to the Drugdex database for detailed clinical information about specific drugs, including indications, adverse effects, and drug interactions.; CONCLUSION: The cost reports that were developed through the collaboration between the CIDSS and the department of pharmacy services have permitted a more robust understanding of drug-use trends by a wider audience of physician leaders and clinical pharmacists at the institution. These data are critical in formulating strategies to control drug expenses by each service.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and reduce inter-observer variations in the detection and characterization of pulmonary nod-ules on digital radiograph (DR) chest images.; METHODS: Two hundreds and thirty-two new posterior-anterior DR chest images were collected from out-patient screening patients. Consensus was reached by two experienced radiologists on the marking, rating, and segmentation of small actionable nodules ranged from 5 to 15 mm in diameter using a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Both their own nodule findings and the computer's automatic nodule detection results were analyzed to make the consensus. Nodules identified together with corresponding likelihood rating and segmentation results were referred as "Gold Standard". Two un-experienced radiologists were asked to first mark and characterize suspicious nodules independently, then were allowed to consult the computer nodule detection results and change their decisions.; RESULTS: Large inter-observer variations in pulmonary nodule identification and characterization on DR chest images were observed between un-experienced radiologists. Un-experienced radiologists could greatly benefit from the CAD system, including substantial decrease of inter-observer variation and improvement of nodule detection rates. Moreover, radiologists with different levels of skillfulness could achieve similar high level performance after using the CAD system.; CONCLUSION: The CAD system shows a high potential for providing a valuable assistance to the examination of DR chest images.

AB In recent years, spurred by developments in evidence-informed medicine, a movement to strengthen evidence-informed managerial decision making in healthcare organizations has emerged in the United States and in other countries. The drivers of this movement include demands by payers and consumer groups for improved quality of care, increased operational efficiency, and greater accountability from healthcare organizations. But numerous barriers to managers' use of evidence in decision making exist, including time pressures, perceived threats to autonomy, preference for colloquial knowledge based on individual experiences, difficulty accessing the relevant evidence base, reliance on external consultants (and others) to determine the quality of the information, and lack of resources. To help managers overcome these barriers, we developed the Informed Decisions Toolbox. It provides tools to help managers efficiently perform the six key steps in the evidence-informed approach to decision making: (1) framing the management question, (2) finding sources of information, (3) assessing the accuracy of the information, (4) assessing the applicability of the information, (5) assessing the actionability of the evidence, and (6) determining if the information is adequate. To build an organizational environment conducive to evidence-informed decision making, we suggest four leadership-driven strategies: (1) recognize and respond to the growing demand for accountability as a strategic issue, (2) establish organizational structures and processes for knowledge transfer, (3) build a questioning organizational culture, and (4) build organizational research capabilities. With organizational support, managers who use the tools presented in the Informed Decisions Toolbox will be able to take control of the decision-making process, will be less reliant on colloquial evidence and consultants, and will be better able to improve the performance of their organizations.

AB This article develops a quantitative all-hazards framework for critical asset and portfolio risk analysis (CAPRA) that considers both natural and human-caused hazards. Following a discussion on the nature of security threats, the need for actionable risk assessments, and the distinction between asset and portfolio-level analysis, a general formula for all-hazards risk analysis is obtained that resembles the traditional model based on the notional product of consequence, vulnerability, and threat, though with clear meanings assigned to each parameter. Furthermore, a simple portfolio consequence model is presented that yields first-order estimates of interdependency effects following a successful attack on an asset. Moreover, depending on the needs of the decisions being made and available analytical resources, values for the parameters in this model can be obtained at a high level or through detailed systems analysis. Several illustrative examples of the CAPRA methodology are provided.

AB One of the most important steps in the entire process of monitoring and improving quality of care is to identify the proper quality measures. This may be challenging from the outset since no single indicator can fully comprehend the entire concept of quality of care, which is multidimensional by nature. Ideally, multiple indicators should be used at the same time to obtain a more precise assessment of the quality of care. The quality of care can be measured by observing its structure, its processes, and its outcomes. Each indicator may reflect different aspects of quality and may be of particular interest to different audiences (providers, consumers, regulators, purchasers). The selection of one or the other may depend on the objectives of the analysis and the target audience. Although outcomes represent the ultimate product of health care, if the focus is on identifying and remedying apparent variations in performance, it is often preferable to measure not only outcomes but also the desirable processes of care. From a performance management perspective, the key issue is that a desirable process should be unambiguously associated with improved patient health outcomes. Monitoring the process can then be a substitute for measuring the outcome. Unlike outcome indicators, process measures have the potential to identify for clinicians exactly which processes they followed or did not follow that had the potential to affect patient outcomes. Process indicators provide information that is actionable. Finally, thoracic surgeons should take the lead in the managerial approach to the evaluation of performance, preventing administrative personnel unfamiliar with our multifaceted clinical world from judging our practice through imprecise instruments. We, as physicians, must absolutely improve our skill and confidence in risk analysis, outcome-evaluation methods, and process-based assessment of our practice.

AB The market for molecular diagnostic tests is predicted to grow at extraordinary rates over the next 10 years, fueled by pharmacogenetics and the elusive dream of personalized medicine. The challenge is managing the expectations of the medical community and the public at large that have already been set by speculation, promises, and the repeated exposure to headlines about genetic discoveries. Personalized medicine is a paradigm that exists more in conceptual terms than in reality, with only a few marketed drug-test companion products and not very many actual clinical practices set up to personalize medicine in the way that supporters have intended. Nevertheless, the reality of personalized medicine has become more imminent because of the increased awareness of the shortcomings in the delivery of drugs with adequate benefit/risk to patients, a better molecular understanding of how to optimize drug selection and dosing, and an increased demand for integrating more clinically relevant genetic information into the drug development process to improve both innovation and productivity. This paper focuses on personalized medicine by (1) looking at some converging changes taking place in the health-care landscape that are creating a scientific and social infrastructure to enable personalized medicine, (2) considering challenges that need to be addressed with regard to clinical evidence standards for validating genotype-phenotype associations, and (3) considering how clinical pharmacology can help construct a rational personalized medicine framework. As therapeutic experts, clinical pharmacologists can work to assure that "good therapeutics follows good diagnostics". They are well equipped to provide timely genetic education to others and to interpret genetic data so that actionable decisions, especially about drug dosing in individual patients, can be implemented in clinical practice.

AB Network-centric warfare's (NCW) information-rich systems involving sophisticated sensors, tracking systems, smart weapons, and enhanced digital communications threaten to overload combatants with voluminous amounts of data. It is unclear whether warfighters will perceive such extensive data as actionable information to which they will respond accurately in a timely enough manner. Members of small teams in command and control centers, operating in crew-served vehicles, or simply "grunting it out" as ground-pounding infantrymen, may be disparately separated by space, but will communicate and be connected by electronic linkages, e.g., radio, text messages, situation displays, or global positioning data. However, team members will also have to remember shared mental models of tasks at hand, pay attention to and share common situation awareness in complex operational environments, perform team cognition and team coordination, and integrate both lower and higher cognitive processes with those of team behaviors. Such exceptional capabilities are required more now than ever before; such capabilities today are far from assured. After two workshops to establish performance metrics for assessing cognitive performance of military personnel in NCW, this preface introduces five manuscripts addressing team cognition and team performance from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. The authors of this preface question if NCW, and perhaps the politico-social ramifications of modern warfare, have already outstripped behavioral scientists' approach to researching team cognition and team performance-expertise that is so crucially needed for combatants on the rapidly changing 21st-century battlegrounds.

AB Under their initiative on Global Health and Foreign Policy, launched in September, 2006, in New York, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand issued the following statement in Oslo on March 20, 2007-In today's era of globalisation and interdependence there is an urgent need to broaden the scope of foreign policy. Together, we face a number of pressing challenges that require concerted responses and collaborative efforts. We must encourage new ideas, seek and develop new partnerships and mechanisms, and create new paradigms of cooperation. We believe that health is one of the most important, yet still broadly neglected, long-term foreign policy issues of our time. Life and health are our most precious assets. There is a growing awareness that investment in health is fundamental to economic growth and development. It is generally acknowledged that threats to health may compromise a country's stability and security. We believe that health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. We have therefore agreed to make impact on health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies, and to engage in a dialogue on how to deal with policy options from this perspective. As Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we will work to: increase awareness of our common vulnerability in the face of health threats by bringing health issues more strongly into the arenas of foreign policy discussions and decisions, in order to strengthen our commitment to concerted action at the global level; build bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation for global health security by strengthening the case for collaboration and brokering broad agreement, accountability, and action; reinforce health as a key element in strategies for development and for fighting poverty, in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals; ensure that a higher priority is given to health in dealing with trade issues and in conforming to the Doha principles, affirming the right of each country to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to ensure universal access to medicines; strengthen the place of health measures in conflict and crisis management and in reconstruction efforts. For this purpose, we have prepared a first set of actionable steps for raising the priority of health in foreign policy in an Agenda for Action. We pledge to pursue these issues in our respective regional settings and in relevant international bodies. We invite Ministers of Foreign Affairs from all regions to join us in further exploring ways and means to achieve our objectives.

AB To identify actionable elements for improving best practice, this study examined the relative effects of patient, surgeon and hospital factors on surgical treatment variation of 2,929 early breast cancer patients, diagnosed from January 1998 to January 2002 in the region of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre North-Netherlands. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the hierarchically structured data. Apart from the patient level, 43.3% of the treatment variation was due to the hospital and 56.7% to the surgeon, after adjustment for patient characteristics. Although hospital factors like volume, teaching status, and management and policy contributed to this variation, multidisciplinary care seemed the most important actionable hospital factor. Although the surgeon was shown to be an important starting point for quality improvement, actionable elements seemed difficult to identify as factors like surgeon experience and volume were not conclusive and significant variance on this level remained (sigma2 = 0.149, SE 0.053). We conclude that multidisciplinary care can improve best practice and that further research into actionable surgeon factors is needed.

AB AIM: The general aims of this article were to facilitate primary care nurses (District Nurse Team Leaders) to link management and leadership theories with clinical practice and to improve the quality of the service provided to their patients. The specific aim was to identify, create and evaluate effective processes for collaborative working so that the nurses' capacity for clinical decision-making could be improved.; BACKGROUND: This article, part of a doctoral study on Clinical Leadership in Nursing, has wider application in the workplace of the future where professional standards based on collaboration will be more critical in a world of work that will be increasingly complex and uncertain. This article heralds the type of research and development activities that the nursing and midwifery professions should give premier attention to, particularly given the recent developments within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. The implications of: Agenda for Change, the Knowledge and Skills Framework, 'Our Health, Our Care, Our Say' and the recent proposals from the article 'Modernising Nursing Career', to name but a few, are the key influences impacting on and demanding new ways of clinical supervision for nurses and midwives to improve the quality of patient management and services.; METHOD: The overall approach was based on an action research using a collaborative enquiry within a case study. This was facilitated by a process of executive co-coaching for focused group clinical supervision sessions involving six district nurses as co-researchers and two professional doctoral candidates as the main researchers. The enquiry conducted over a period of two and a half years used evidence-based management and leadership interventions to assist the participants to develop 'actionable knowledge'. Group clinical supervision was not practised in this study as a form of 'therapy' but as a focus for the development of actionable knowledge, knowledge needed for effective clinical management and leadership in the workplace.; FINDINGS: 1. Management and leadership interventions and approaches have significantly influenced the participants' capacity to improve the quality of services provided to their patients. 2. Using various techniques, tools, methods and frameworks presented at the sessions increased participants' confidence to perform. 3. A structured approach like the Clinical Nursing Leadership Learning and Action Process (CLINLAP) model makes implementing change more practical and manageable within a turbulent care environment. The process of Stakeholder Mapping and Management made getting agreement to do things differently much easier. Generally it is clear that many nurses and midwives, according to the participants, have to carry out management and leadership activities in their day-to-day practice. The traditional boundary between the private, the public and the voluntary sector management is increasingly becoming blurred.; CONCLUSION: It is conclusive that the district nurses on this innovative programme demonstrated how they were making sense of patterns from the past, planning for the future and facilitating the clinical nursing leadership processes today to improve quality patient services tomorrow. Their improved capacity to manage change and lead people was demonstrated, for example, through their questioning attitudes about the dominance of general practitioners. They did this, for example, by initiating and leading case conferences with the multi-disciplinary teams. It became evident from this study that to use group clinical supervision with an executive co-coaching approach for the implementation and to sustain quality service demand that 'good nursing' is accepted as being synonymous with 'good management'. This is the future of 'new nursing'.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance and potential contribution of computer-aided detection (CAD) to independent double reading of paired screen-film and full-field digital screening mammograms.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases of 3,683 women who underwent both screen-film mammography and full-field digital mammography (FFDM) with independent double reading for each technique were followed for 2 years to include cancers detected in the interval between screening rounds and cancers detected at the next screening round. Fifty-five biopsy-proven cancers were diagnosed. The baseline screening mammograms of the 55 cancers were defined as having positive findings if at least one of two independent readers scored it 2 or higher on a 5-point rating scale. The baseline mammograms of interval (n = 10) or secondround (n = 16) cancers were retrospectively classified as overlooked (n = 2), minimal sign actionable (n = 8), minimal sign nonactionable (n = 5), and normal (n = 11). The baseline mammograms of these cases of cancer were evaluated with a CAD system, and the CAD results were compared (McNemar's test for paired proportions) with the findings at prospective independent double reading of mammograms obtained with each technique.; RESULTS: For FFDM, CAD sensitivity was 95% (37/39) compared with 64% (25/39) for double reading (p = 0.006), and for screen-film mammography, CAD sensitivity was 85% (33/39) compared with 77% (30/39) for prospective double reading (p = 0.57) of radiographically visible lesions in baseline mammograms. CAD correctly marked five (13%) of 39 cancers on screen-film mammography and 14 (36%) of 39 cancers on FFDM not detected at prospective independent double reading.; CONCLUSION: CAD showed the potential to increase the cancer detection rate for FFDM and for screen-film mammography in breast cancer screening performed with independent double reading.

AB Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. The correct maintenance dose of warfarin for a given patient is difficult to predict, the drug carries a high risk of toxicity, and variability among patients means that the safe dose range differs widely between individuals. Recent pharmacogenetic studies indicate that the routine incorporation of genetic testing into warfarin therapy protocols could substantially ease both the financial and health risks currently associated with this treatment. In particular, the variability in warfarin dose requirement is now recognized to be due, in large part, to polymorphisms in two genes: cytochrome P450 2C9 and the vitaminK epoxide reductase complex subunit1. The development of algorithms that integrate all of the relevant genetic and physical factors into comprehensive, individualized predictive models for warfarin dose could be used to translate the results of pharmacogenetic testing into actionable clinicalapplication.

AB Adult bean thrips, Caliothrips fasciatus (Pergande), overwintering inside the navel of navel oranges shipped from California to Australia, are an actionable pest for the importing country, i.e. infested lots are fumigated with methyl bromide. Strict quarantine regulations regarding C. fasciatus prompted studies on the best colour sticky trap that might be used to monitor for bean thrips populations in the vicinity of California citrus groves prior to harvesting fruit for export. Preliminary experiments identified the most attractive trap of each of four colours (blue, green, white, yellow) commonly used to sample adult Thysanoptera. Three trials of a field study were conducted, comparing C. fasciatus capture on the best card of each colour using asparagus ferns naturally infested with high levels of this pest. Based on significantly higher catch on green sticky cards, this colour trap is recommended for potential use in California's bean thrips mitigation plan designed to reduce thrips levels on citrus exported to Australia.

AB Pathologic processes are underlying defining features of systemic vasculitis. When these pathologic processes can not be observed directly, surrogate signs and symptoms of disease must be used to conclude that vasculitis is present in a patient and, if so, to determine what specific type of vasculitis is present. This review briefly describes the most defining pathologic features of giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease, microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome; and discusses how these pathologic features can be integrated with clinical and laboratory data to reach an actionable diagnosis.

AB The authors of the lead essay present a compelling case for the development and implementation of a national strategy on chronic disease prevention and management (CDPM). The literature demonstrates that the Chronic Care Model can improve quality and reduce costs. Substantial evidence supports the role of health information technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs) in achieving these goals. However, an interoperable pan-Canadian health infostructure does not exist; funding is required to establish this across the continuum of care. An investment of $350 per capita would provide a robust health technology platform to support a national CDPM strategy. Such an investment would deliver annual benefits of $6-$7.6 billion; this could be leveraged to support national healthcare priorities such as CDPM. EHRs will improve decisions about care, reduce system errors and increase efficiency. They will also improve our ability to measure, assess and manage care. We cannot run a high-performing health system without sound data. This was a key step to enabling progress on wait times management. Leadership is required if a national CDPM strategy is to become reality. The authors made a convincing case for the development of a national strategy; we need to turn their words into actionable events to gain necessary momentum.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess the usefulness of computer-aided detection (CAD) in the interpretation of screening mammography and to provide the true sensitivity and specificity of this technique in a clinical setting.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Over a 26-month period, 5,016 screening mammograms were interpreted without, and subsequently with, the assistance of the iCAD MammoReader detection system. Data collected for actionable findings included dominant feature (calcification, mass, asymmetry, architectural distortion), detection method (radiologist only, CAD only, or both radiologist and CAD), BI-RADS assessment code, associated histopathology for those undergoing biopsy, and tumor stage for malignant lesions. The study population was cross-checked against an independent reference standard to identify false-negative cases.; RESULTS: Of the 5,016 cases, the recall rate increased from 12% to 14% with the addition of CAD. Of the 107 (2%) patients who underwent biopsy, 101 (94%) were prompted by the radiologist and six (6%) were prompted by CAD. Of the 124 biopsies performed on actionable findings in the 107 patients, findings in 79 (64%) were benign and in 45 (36%) were in situ or invasive carcinoma. Three study participants who were not recalled by the radiologist with the assistance of CAD developed cancer within 1 year of the screening mammogram and were considered to be false-negative cases. The radiologist detected 43 (90%) of the 48 total malignancies and 45 (94%) of the 48 malignancies with the assistance of CAD. CAD missed eight cancers that were detected by the radiologist, which presented as architectural distortions (n = 3), irregular masses (n = 4), and a circumscribed mass (n = 1). CAD detected two in situ cancers as a faint cluster of calcifications that had not been perceived by the radiologist and one mass that was dismissed by the radiologist, accounting for at least a 4.7% increase in cancer detection rate. Sensitivity of screening mammography with the use of CAD (94%) represented an absolute and relative 4% increase over the sensitivity of the radiologist alone (90%). Specificity of screening mammography with and without the use of CAD was 99%.; CONCLUSION: Routine use of CAD while interpreting screening mammograms significantly increases recall rates, has no significant effect on positive predictive value for biopsy, and can increase cancer detection rate by at least 4.7% and sensitivity by at least 4%. This study provides "true" values for sensitivity and specificity for use of CAD in interpretation of screening mammography as measured prospectively in the context of a working clinical setting.

AB The disease management (DM) "value chain" is composed of a linear series of steps that include operational milestones in the development of knowledge, each stage evolving from the preceding one. As an adaptation of Michael Porter's "value chain" model, the process flow in DM moves along the following path: (1) data/information technology, (2) information generation, (3) analysis, (4) assessment/recommendations, (5) actionable customer plan, and (6) program assessment/reassessment. Each of these stages is managed as a major line of product operations within a DM company or health plan. Metrics around each of the key production variables create benchmark milestones, ongoing management insight into program effectiveness, and potential drivers for activity-based cost accounting pricing models. The value chain process must remain robust from early entry of data and information into the system, through the final presentation and recommendations for our clients if the program is to be effective. For individuals involved in the evaluation or review of DM programs, this framework is an excellent method to visualize the key components and sequence in the process. The value chain model is an excellent way to establish the value of a formal DM program and to create a consultancy relationship with a client involved in purchasing these complex services.

AB BACKGROUND: An independent state agency, the Authority is charged with taking steps to reduce and eliminate medical errors by identifying problems and recommending solutions that promote patient safety. PENNSYLVANIA PATIENT SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM (PA-PSRS): The Authority implemented PA-PSRS, a mandatory reporting and analysis system for both adverse events and near-misses, among 450 hospitals, birthing centers, and ambulatory surgical facilities. Pennsylvania is the only state to require the reporting of both adverse events and near-misses.; THE PATIENT SAFETY ADVISORY: The Patient Safety Advisory is a quarterly publication containing articles about trends in reports submitted to PA-PSRS. The peer-reviewed articles include analysis of and lessons learned from PA-PSRS reports and evidence-based risk reduction strategies based on research in the clinical literature. To complement and reinforce the effectiveness of certain Advisory articles, the Authority has introduced electronic, educational tool kits on its Web site that can be downloaded. They include posters, draft policies, audio-slide presentations for staff training, and other materials related to clinical implementation of patient safety interventions and protocols.; SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: In just over two years, the Authority has developed a program that turns reports into actionable items through the analysis and research of adverse events and near-misses.

AB In this article, a reproducible process for presenting, analyzing, and reducing early and late surgical morbidity and mortality (M and M) is detailed. All M and M cases presented from 1998 through 2005 at Monmouth Medical Center were categorized. Residents and nurses were empowered to report the complications. The five major categories were overwhelming disease on admission, delays in treatment, diagnostic or judgment complications, treatment complications, and technical complications. From the 53,541 operations performed over 8 years, 714 patients were presented, which included 147 deaths and 1,132 category entries. The most common problems were technical complications in 474 (66.4%) patients. The data have generated actionable solutions, many with low barriers to adoption, resulting in safer, less expensive surgical management. Surgical outcome benchmarks have been established and are used for credentialing surgeons. The "Hostile Abdomen Index" has been developed to assess the safest choice for abdominal operative access, pre- and intraoperatively. We explained the real-time process that generated solutions for the entire department as well as changes relevant to residency training and individual operative techniques.

AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of three-dimensional (3D) lossy image compression of multidetector computed tomography chest scans on computer-aided detection (CAD) of solid lung nodules greater than 4 mm in size.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 cases, acquired with 1.25-mm collimation, were collected from 5 different sites, of which 66/120 were low-dose cases. Two chest radiologists established that 37 cases had no actionable lung nodules; the remaining 83 cases contained 169 nodules (range 3.8-35.0 mm, mean 5.8 mm +/- 3.0 [SD]). All cases were compressed using the 3D Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees algorithm to 24:1, 48:1, and 96:1 levels. A study of the effect of compression on computer-aided detection (CAD) sensitivity was performed at operating points of 2.5 false marks (FM), 5 FM, and 10 FM per case using McNemar's test. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact on CAD sensitivity by compression level on nodule and image characteristics.; RESULTS: Compared with no compression, there was no significant degradation in CAD sensitivity found at any of the studied compression levels and operating points. However, between compression levels, there was marginal association with sensitivity. Specifically, 24:1 level was significantly better than 96:1 at all operating points, and occasionally better than no compression at 10 FM/case. Based on multivariate analysis, nodule location was found to be a significant predictor (P = .01) with a lower sensitivity associated with juxtapleural nodules. Nodule size, dose, reconstruction filter, and contrast medium were not significant predictors.; CONCLUSION: CAD detection performance of solid lung nodules did not suffer until 48:1 compression.

AB BACKGROUND: Infection control process measures provide actionable and measurable indicators for performance improvement.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between the measurement and feedback of selected infection control process measures and compliance with infection control practices.; METHODS: We measured selected infection control process measures (hand hygiene, femoral catheter use as a proportion of all central venous catheter (CVC) days and proportion of head of bed elevations) in the medical respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) (MRICU) and the surgical trauma ICU (STICU). All data were collected by trained infection control practitioners. Baseline data were obtained April through June 2004. Baseline hand hygiene data were obtained from May to June. Follow-up observations were obtained from July 2004 through March 2005. Both baseline and follow-up observations were reported to the units' leadership. The data were reviewed for improvement in compliance with process measures. Differences in proportions were analyzed for statistical significance by the chi(2) test.; RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in the head of bed elevation rates: 54.9% versus 98.4% (P < .001) for the MRICU and 46.5% versus 77.2% (P < .001) for the STICU, respectively. There was also a statistically significant decline in femoral catheter rates in both ICUs: 17.8% versus 10% (P = .001) in the MRICU and 8.4% versus 3% (P < .001) in the STICU, respectively. There was no significant improvement in hand hygiene rates in either ICU: 31.8% versus 39.3% (P = .1) in the MRICU and 50% versus 50.3% (P = .9) in the STICU, respectively.; CONCLUSION: Feedback of process measures lowered the use of femoral catheters and improved the proportion of elevated head of beds in 2 ICUs, but there was no significant improvement in hand hygiene.

Readings < or = 400 ppt were interpreted as negative, and readings >400 ppt were interpreted as positive. Initial positive samples were subsequently assayed 2 additional times. If both retest results were >400 ppt, the sample was called positive/ actionable relative to U.S. and Codex levels, 500 ppt. The concentration of 400 ppt was chosen for the positive/negative interpretation to provide 90% sensitivity with 95% confidence at the 500 ppt legislative level. The combined false negative rate was <5% (4 of 83) for samples at 500 and 550 ppt. The false violatives at 0, 300, 350, 400, and 450 ppt (n = 42 at each level) were 0, 0, 21, 14, and 93%, respectively. The 90% positive concentration with 95% confidence was 503 ppt by probit analysis. The average intralaboratory repeatability was 11% and average interlaboratory reproducibility was 13% for the fortified sample pairs. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the study samples by 5 laboratories showed 38% false negatives with the 500 and 550 ppt samples, and a 0% false-violative rate with samples less than the 500 ppt action level.

AB Because predicting and outlining guidance for all possible scenarios is difficult, advance directives are rarely sufficiently precise to dictate patient preferences in specific situations as a disease progresses. Nonetheless, advance care planning is an essential process that should begin at the time of diagnosis, if not already initiated, to ensure that all patient and family rights are preserved. Communicating effectively with the patient and family and having the patient designate a surrogate decision-maker are critical. Attention must be paid to resolving conflicts among patient values and preferences and those of family and the health care team. Patient-centered goals for care and expectations should be elicited at first assessment and reassessed frequently as conditions change. As a disease progresses, advance directives are rarely precise enough to predict all possible scenarios and outline guidance for care. Therefore, for patients with advanced metastatic cancer and a potential life expectancy of less than 1 year, converting patient-centered treatment goals into actionable medical orders while the patient maintains capacity is a more effective way to ensure that patient preferences are honored. Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) and similar medical order forms provide explicit direction about resuscitation status ("code status") if the patient is pulseless and apneic. POLST also includes directions about additional interventions the patient may or may not want. A decade of research in Oregon has proved that the POLST Paradigm Program more accurately conveys end-of-life preferences that are more likely to be followed by medical professionals than traditional advance directives alone.

AB Stroke results in substantial morbidity and mortality globally. Asia-Pacific countries bear a disproportionate share of the burden of stroke, a burden that will grow as their populations' life expectancies rise. Hypertension is the single most important reversible risk factor for stroke, and effective measures to reduce blood pressure contribute significantly to reducing the incidence of stroke. The Asia-Pacific Consensus Conference on Stroke Prevention in Hypertensive Patients assembled leading experts from the region to reach an actionable consensus aimed at reducing stroke-induced morbidity and mortality in Asia through the evidence-based treatment of hypertension. The discussions of the group focused on how best to improve blood pressure control, how to promote lifestyle changes at the population level, and how to reduce the clinical and health system barriers and other challenges facing developing and low-income countries. The experts concluded that physicians must place an increased priority on reducing their patients' risk of stroke and recognise that all hypertensive patients are at greater risk of having a stroke compared with nonhypertensive individuals. They advocated that physicians must educate hypertensive patients about the risk of stroke, promote lifestyle modification to all patients diagnosed with hypertension, and prescribe rigorous antihypertensive treatment to get patients to recommended blood pressure goals.

AB The success of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics as a method for analyzing proteins in biological samples is accompanied by challenges owning to demands for increased throughput. These challenges arise from the vast volume of data generated by proteomics experiments combined with the heterogeneity in data formats, processing methods, software tools and databases that are involved in the translation of spectral data into relevant and actionable information for scientists. Informatics aims to provide answers to these challenges by transferring existing solutions from information management to proteomics and/or by generating novel computational methods for automation of proteomics data processing.

AB BACKGROUND: As a strategy for improving clinical practice guideline (CPG) adherence, audit and feedback (A&F) has been found to be variably effective, yet A&F research has not investigated the impact of feedback characteristics on its effectiveness. This paper explores how high performing facilities (HPF) and low performing facilities (LPF) differ in the way they use clinical audit data for feedback purposes.; METHOD: Descriptive, qualitative, cross-sectional study of a purposeful sample of six Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) with high and low adherence to six CPGs, as measured by external chart review audits. One-hundred and two employees involved with outpatient CPG implementation across the six facilities participated in one-hour semi-structured interviews where they discussed strategies, facilitators and barriers to implementing CPGs. Interviews were analyzed using techniques from the grounded theory method.; RESULTS: High performers provided timely, individualized, non-punitive feedback to providers, whereas low performers were more variable in their timeliness and non-punitiveness and relied on more standardized, facility-level reports. The concept of actionable feedback emerged as the core category from the data, around which timeliness, individualization, non-punitiveness, and customizability can be hierarchically ordered.; CONCLUSION: Facilities with a successful record of guideline adherence tend to deliver more timely, individualized and non-punitive feedback to providers about their adherence than facilities with a poor record of guideline adherence. Consistent with findings from organizational research, feedback intervention characteristics may influence the feedback's effectiveness at changing desired behaviors.

AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Total body screening, despite its popularity, has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Even the appropriate target for screening has not been addressed. In this study, we determined the variables from a subject's demographic and medical and family history that are predictive of actionable findings on total body screening.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 3-year period, 982 self-referred subjects underwent total body screening with multislice computed tomography and completed a demographic and medical history questionnaire. The study sample was divided into training and testing samples. Univariate and multiple-variable statistical methods were used on the training sample to derive models that predict actionable lung findings, actionable heart findings, actionable abdomen/pelvis findings, and any actionable findings on total body screening. The training models were then applied and evaluated on the test sample.; RESULTS: A subject's age at the time of screening was the single most important predictor and often the only significant predictor of actionable findings. Among subjects younger than 40 years of age, 22.5% had actionable findings; this number nearly doubled, to 43.5%, for subjects between 40 and 49, and increased to 80% for subjects 80 years and older. Overall, every increase of 10 years in age brings an increase of 1.6 in the likelihood of an actionable finding.; CONCLUSIONS: Total body screening targeted at older subjects has the highest yield of actionable findings. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of total body screening for older subjects is unknown and needs further assessment.

AB Although the health communication program feedback cycle is frequently referenced, the steps for moving between or within the sections of the model in a public health environment are rarely described. We detail the process by which the Texas Tobacco Research Consortium implemented the stage of "assessing effectiveness and making refinement" and expanded it to include a program assessment feedback model. Tools were developed to move the consortium through five stages of the expanded program assessment feedback model: 1) formulate research questions using logic models to identify key evaluation items, 2) format data displays from multiple data sources to address research questions, 3) use a facilitated group process to present and review research findings, 4) prepare group recommendations, and 5) involve local partners to translate recommendations into practice. The process allowed us to sift through a large volume of information and prepare data-based program recommendations. A Web-based reporting system provided timely access to community-based program activity data and process indicators that, when linked to logic models, provided actionable items for program improvement. Partnerships among researchers and state and local practitioners created the conditions for implementing the recommendations. Program changes included revisions to program materials, target audiences, and evaluation instruments for a community-based tobacco-cessation campaign. The systematic approach allowed translation of research into practice and should be applicable to other areas of population-based health promotion.

AB Clinical guidelines translate complex research findings and expert opinion into actionable recommendations. However, the effectiveness of even evidence-based guidelines is rarely tested as a whole in a real clinical environment. We have developed a decision support system for implementing clinical guidelines in a busy pediatric practice. We have added to this system the ability to randomize patients to receive care with or without system support of the guideline or guideline components. The randomization is part of the Arden Syntax that implements the system logic. The result is a relatively effortless process for testing guidelines, as they are implemented, to assure that they are effective. We describe the system and the process by which this guideline evaluation functionality was built in, using two guidelines (asthma management and maternal depression screening) both of which have been applied to thousands of patients to date.

AB CPOE systems hold the promise of both reducing medical errors and improving compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Evidence-based order sets have been used to make evidence-based guidelines actionable at the point of care. Investigators have conducted research into factors effecting order set use, but little has been documented regarding order set compliance. Under the direction of the Chief Medical Officer, Vanderbilt University Medical Center undertook a major effort to ensure order sets in the Vanderbilt CPOE system are evidence-based. The Vanderbilt EvidenceWeb was developed in order to monitor use and progress, and to provide feedback to clinical teams based on their requests for data. Monitoring tools and feedback to clinical groups regarding order set use and compliance have proved to be key components in improving delivery of evidence-based care.

AB The models outlined above represent alternative constructs for examining factors that may or may not influence human health in a positive manner. If the economic framework seems more theoretical than actionable, consider an alternative framework that has been advanced by the American Hospital Association and described in Table I. Regardless of the framework adopted, work to improve the health care system and its financing will be hard, irrespective of whether incremental or wholesale changes are made. What is important, however, is that a thoughtful approach be taken and the trade-offs of each decision carefully weighted. The health of the population of the state and the country depend on it.

AB We show that residual cell material from ThinPrep PapTest (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, MA) atypical squamous-cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) cases may be manually reprocessed to triage women into actionable diagnostic categories (HSIL, LSIL, and Negative). Material remaining from each of 358 ThinPrep ASCUS cases was manually reprocessed as two slides, labeled "A" and "B." Interobserver agreement between case contributors (CCs) and three sequential reviewers (SRs) was analyzed with 186 cases (Study 1), and diagnostic reproducibility between SRs was examined with an additional 172 cases (Study 2). In Study 1, CCs classified 33% of cases as LSIL or greater, SRs classified 60% as LSIL or greater, and there was 58% diagnostic agreement between CCs and SRs. No "Negative" case assignment by one group afforded an "HSIL" assignment by the complementary group. In Study 2, there was 95% agreement between SRs A slide and B slide diagnoses with 54% of A slides and 55% of B slides classified as LISL or greater. Again, no "Negative" case assignment to one slide afforded an "HSIL" assignment to the complementary slide. Overall, 12.6% of the 358 cases showed HSIL, and all HSILs by one observer group were ASCUS or greater by the complementary observer group. Using manual reprocessing beyond the 21-day specimen outdate for HPV testing by the Hybrid Capture II High Risk HPV test (HR-HCII; Digene Corporation, Beltsville, MD), many ThinPrep ASCUS cases were reclassified as LSIL or HSIL. The 12.6% HSIL proportion of this study approximated the 11.5% CIN 2 or greater proportion of the ALTS ASCUS arm. Similar to ALTS, manual liquid-based cytology (MLBC) would have referred nearly 60% of women to colposcopy for a definitive diagnosis of HSIL or LSIL without resorting to HPV testing. These data demonstrate that many cases of automated liquid-based cytology (ALBC)-diagnosed ASCUS represent unrecognized SIL, which is present in the ALBC specimen vial at the time the ASCUS diagnosis is rendered.

AB BACKGROUND: In order to fulfill the mission of providing superb respiratory care, managing respiratory care services requires communication and collaboration. To enhance communication and collaboration in our Section of Respiratory Therapy at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and to generate ideas for improvement, since 1996 we have conducted annual retreats for the Section, during which important challenges and opportunities are discussed in a large-group forum. The current report describes the retreat process and outcomes, namely the ideas generated during these retreats and the frequency with which ideas were implemented successfully.; METHODS: The annual retreat brings together all clinical specialists, supervisors, and managers in the Section of Respiratory Therapy, along with the medical director of Respiratory Therapy and representatives of the staff from each shift. In advance of the annual half-day retreat, supervisors and clinical specialists are asked to write a brief description of things that need improvement and actionable proposed solutions to these challenges. These documents are reviewed by the supervisors, managers, education coordinator, and medical director, and a list of discussion topics for the retreat is formulated. The retreat day begins with a brief introduction and summary of the year's activities and then encourages open-ended discussions regarding the various topics, with the explicit, repeated goal of generating solutions. Minutes are kept to identify specific action items, a list of which is visited repeatedly throughout the year, to assess progress toward successful completion of each action item. In the current analysis, the primary outcome measures are the number of ideas generated as action items during the retreats and the frequency with which these ideas have been implemented.; RESULTS: Over the 8 years of annual retreats, 103 action items have been generated, of which 84% (n = 87) have been successfully implemented or completed. As evidence of the importance of this group-based activity, we cite several examples of suggestions and action items that were felt to uniquely represent group process and wisdom and which were not proposed beforehand by individuals.; CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this experience, we recommend conducting annual respiratory therapy department retreats. We believe the benefits include collective problem-solving in a public forum to identify solutions not advanced by individuals. Also, we believe that the direct communication in such retreats contributes to enhanced morale, further evidence of which is the very low turnover rate among our respiratory therapists during the 8 years in which we have conducted annual retreats.

AB Modulation of melanogenesis in the melanocytes can be achieved using chemicals that share structural homologies with the substrate tyrosine and as thus competitively inhibit the catalytic function of tyrosinase. We have developed a new tyrosinase inhibitor, deoxyArbutin (dA), based on this premise. DeoxyArbutin demonstrates effective inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase in vitro with a Ki that is 10-fold lower that hydroquinone (HQ) and 350-fold lower than arbutin. In a hairless, pigmented guinea pig model, dA demonstrated rapid and sustained skin lightening that was completely reversible within 8 weeks after halt in topical application. In contrast, HQ induced a short but unsustained skin lightening effect whereas kojic acid and arbutin exhibit no skin lightening effect. Results from a panel of safety tests supported the overall establishment of dA as an actionable molecule. In a human clinical trial, topical treatment of dA for 12 weeks resulted in a significant or slight reduction in overall skin lightness and improvement of solar lentigines in a population of light skin or dark skin individuals, respectively. These data demonstrate that dA has potential tyrosinase inhibitory activity that can result in skin lightening and may be used to ameliorate hyperpigmentary lesions.

AB Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is highly predictive of overall axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer. Historically, SLN-positive patients have undergone axillary lymph node dissection in a second surgery. Intraoperative SLN analysis could reduce the cost and complications of a second surgery; however, existing histopathological methods lack standardization and exhibit poor sensitivity. Rapid molecular methods may lead to improved intraoperative diagnosis of SLN metastasis. In this study, we used a genome-wide gene expression analysis of breast and other tissues to identify seven putative markers for detecting breast cancer metastasis. We assessed the utility of these markers for identifying clinically actionable metastases in lymph nodes through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of SLNs from 254 breast cancer patients. Polymerase chain reaction signals were compared to pathology on a per-patient basis. The optimal two-gene combination, mammaglobin and cytokeratin 19, detected clinically actionable metastasis in breast SLNs with 90% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Application of stringent criteria for identifying presumptive hematoxylin- and eosin-positive samples increased sensitivity and specificity to 91 and 97%, respectively. This study represents the first comprehensive demonstration of the utility of gene expression markers for detecting clinically actionable breast metastases. An intraoperative molecular assay using these markers has the potential to significantly reduce second surgeries for patients undergoing SLN dissection.

AB BACKGROUND: Failure to relay information about test results pending when patients are discharged from the hospital may pose an important patient-safety problem. Few data are available on the epidemiology of test results pending at discharge or on physician awareness of these results.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and physician awareness of potentially actionable laboratory and radiologic test results returning after hospital discharge.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.; SETTING: Two tertiary care academic hospitals.; PATIENTS: 2644 consecutive patients discharged from hospitalist services from February to June 2004.; MEASUREMENTS: The main outcomes were the prevalence and characteristics of potentially actionable test results returning after hospital discharge, awareness of these results by inpatient and primary care physicians, and satisfaction of inpatient physicians with current systems for follow-up on test results. The authors prospectively collected data on test results pending at the time of discharge and, as results returned after discharge, surveyed hospitalists, junior residents, and primary care physicians about those results that were potentially actionable according to a physician-reviewer.; RESULTS: A total of 1095 patients (41%) had 2033 test results return after discharge. Of these results, 191 (9.4% [95% CI, 8.0% to 11.0%]) were potentially actionable. Surveys were sent regarding 155 results, and 105 responses were returned. Of the 105 results in the surveys with responses, physicians had been unaware of 65 (61.6% [CI, 51.3% to 70.9%]); of these 65, they agreed with physician-reviewers that 24 (37.1% [CI, 25.7% to 50.2%]) were actionable and 8 (12.6% [CI, 6.4% to 23.3%]) required urgent action. Inpatient physicians were dissatisfied with their systems for following up on test results returning after discharge.; LIMITATIONS: The authors were unable to determine whether physicians' lack of awareness of test results returning after discharge was associated with adverse outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: Many patients are discharged from hospitals with test results still pending, and physicians are often unaware of potentially actionable test results returning after discharge. Further work is needed to design better follow-up systems for test results returning after hospital discharge.

AB Variations research has broken new ground by moving analysis of Medicare data from the community to the hospital level. The California study of hospitals further illustrates the power of comparing performance to demonstrate the levels of efficiency that can be achieved. WellPoint, replicating the Dartmouth approach with its commercial data, is partnering with medical specialty societies to make data "actionable" and move beyond benchmarking to help providers alter practice patterns. The shared goal is to achieve a material reduction in practice variation throughout health care. Key elements of their partnership include establishing national databases, reducing the administrative burden for pay-for-performance programs and using evidence-based metrics.

AB Recent controversies in the hospital sector have questioned whether the levels of charity care, community benefit, and executive compensation provided by not-for-profit hospitals are consistent with mandates of their tax-exempt status and mission statements. This article demonstrates that these recent controversies stem from a combination of historical influences, regulatory inequities, and competitive disadvantages, which are suffocating many not-for-profit hospitals across the nation. Once the current environment is described, the article discusses each threat and offers actionable recommendations to quell current attacks faced by the industry. First, to address the current probe by the Internal Revenue Service, hospitals must begin to link their executive compensation with their organizational mission. Second, to address recent lawsuits, the article presents a standardized definition of community benefit and recommends an alternative model to classify charity care. Finally, to address recent congressional hearings, the article offers a plan for hospitals to gauge their expected benefit to the community they serve.

AB CONTEXT: The Kenya Partnership for Health (KPH) program began in 1999, and is currently one of the 12 field projects participating in the WHO's 'Towards Unity for Health initiative' implemented to develop partnership synergies in support of the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach 1.; CONTENT: This paper illustrates how Program-linked Information Management by Integrative-participatory Research Approach (PIMIRA) as practised under KPH has been implemented within Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya to enhance community-based health initiatives. It shows how this model is strategically being scaled-up from one community to another in the management of political, social, cultural and economic determinants (barriers and enhancers) of health.; OBJECTIVE: Target rural communities in the development of a community-based health information management and feedback initiatives that can provide insights on the social, cultural, political and economic determinants of health for utilization in informed health service management. KEY FINDINGS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: 1. Cues for health seeking and health service utilization are determined by the social, cultural, political and economic factors as seen by the individual and as defined by the community but not due to the pathological nature of the illness. 2. Establishment of community-based health surveillance and health action initiatives as the best practices in transferring health as a resource that can be 'owned and guarded' by the community. 3. Establishment of Healthy Villages Initiative (HVI) through which health service delivery and scale-up can be sustained at the community level. 4. Provision of actionable health information necessary for health planning and evaluation of preventive health programs thorough PIMIRA.; CONCLUSION: It has been realized that for every one person who visits a health facility for medication, there are nine others who had the same condition but sought health care from other sources including self-medication and five others who never sought health care. Innovative means of involving the community in health information management and utilization such as PIMIRA are hence the best ways of guaranteeing equitable delivery of health services that are accessible and sustainable by the community.

AB OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the potential effect of deploying a sentinel system that scans administrative claims information and clinical data to detect and mitigate errors in care and deviations from best medical practices.; METHODS: Members (n = 39 462; age range, 12-64 years) of a midwestern managed care plan were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The sentinel system was programmed with more than 1000 decision rules that were capable of generating clinical recommendations. Clinical recommendations triggered for subjects in the intervention group were relayed to treating physicians, and those for the control group were deferred to study end.; RESULTS: Nine hundred eight clinical recommendations were issued to the intervention group. Among those in both groups who triggered recommendations, there were 19% fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .001). Charges among those whose recommendations were communicated were dollar 77.91 per member per month (pmpm) lower and paid claims were dollar 68.08 pmpm lower than among controls compared with the baseline values (P = .003 for both). Paid claims for the entire intervention group (with or without recommendations) were dollar 8.07 pmpm lower than those for the entire control group. In contrast, the intervention cost dollar 1.00 pmpm, suggesting an 8-fold return on investment.; CONCLUSION: Ongoing use of a sentinel system to prompt clinically actionable, patient-specific alerts generated from administratively derived clinical data was associated with a reduction in hospitalization, medical costs, and morbidity.

AB Although considerable progress has been made in basic pharmacogenetic research, less has been demonstrated in the application of pharmacogenetics (PGx)-based diagnostics to drug development and in clinical practice. There are drugs that are currently used in the clinic for which individualized therapy could be beneficial based on PGx data. However, specific, actionable recommendations on how to implement individualized therapy--particularly with respect to dosage--still have to be developed. Moreover, to apply PGx efficiently in clinical drug development, and later in drug therapy, study designs and the generation and handling of PGx data need to become more standardized. Here, we argue for the development of concise guidelines for implementation of PGx analyses in drug development and therapy.

AB Advanced clinical information systems have been proposed to improve patient care in terms of safety, effectiveness, and efficiency. In order to be effective, such systems require detailed patient-specific clinical information in a form easily reviewed by clinicians. We have developed a patient summary worksheet for use in outpatient clinics, which presents a structured overview of patient health information. The worksheet provides patient demographic information, specific problems and conditions, the patient's current medication profile, laboratory test results pertinent to patient problems, and disease-specific or preventive care actionable advisories. Usage has grown from a few hundred to over 25,000 unique patients per month during a two-year period. Diabetic patients for whom the worksheet is accessed are significantly more likely to be in compliance with accepted testing regimens for glycosolated hemoglobin (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28, 1.61).

AB Actionable sexual harassment is defined as a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In recent years, there have been a number of significant developments in sexual harassment case law and litigation including: (1) nationwide legal recognition for same-sex sexual harassment; (2) increased standards on employer liability for sexual harassment perpetrated by supervisory and managerial personnel; and (3) guidelines for mitigating damages when employers are found liable. These developments are of particular concern in those professions such as healthcare in which women historically have been represented as a significant portion of the workforce. Moreover, because management and supervisory relationships in healthcare are often cloudy, harassment by "supervisors" in healthcare settings can be an issue of special concern. In this article, we review relevant issues related to sexual harassment and provide guidance in dealing with the issue in the workplace.

AB A major responsibility of nursing leaders is to implement systems and policies to improve patient and staff safety, avoid medication errors, and most importantly safeguard patients against harm. In the medication use process, the nurse at the bedside is the most vulnerable, and intravenous (i.v.) drug administration often results in the most serious medication error outcomes. At a 675-bed, tertiary-care "Magnet Hospital System," nurses played a key role in a multidisciplinary process that led to successful implementation of a computerized i.v. medication safety system. Software customization, staff training and product set-up were completed in approximately 2 months; 685 devices were installed in 3 hospitals within 12 hours. Nursing acceptance is excellent, and implementation of the system is thought to enhance nursing retention and recruitment. Preliminary data indicate an estimated 849 programming changes ("near misses") annually, ie, potential infusion errors averted by the i.v. medication safety system. A chronogram created from safety data demonstrates that most infusion error warnings occurred between 3:00 PM and 9:00 PM, with an unexpected peak at 6:00 PM. Implementation of the i.v. medication safety system has prevented potentially serious infusion errors and has provided previously unavailable, actionable continuous quality improvement data for best practice improvements.

AB What if clinical quality medical equipment were available to every consumer in a form factor that was inexpensive, accurate, and easy to use? What if this equipment provided information that previously was un-measurable or very difficult to measure? What if the physiological state of individuals, at resolutions measured in thousandths of a second instead of in visits per year, could be measured easily, making it possible to ascertain caloric intake and expenditure, patterns of sleep, contextual activities such as working-out and driving, even parameters of mental state and health. What aspect of healthcare would not change? We present a system that is available today that enables this vision. This award-winning multi-channel wearable physiological monitor has enabled the collection of more than 90 million minutes of data in natural settings from thousands of subjects engaged in diverse activities. Data modeling efforts are resulting in applications that present meaningful and actionable information in real-time to users and their designated collaborators (physicians, family members, counselors, coaches, etc.) We describe the SenseWear system, its design, and a summary of validation studies, current commercial applications, and ongoing research. This discussion will show how the convergence of design for wearability, advances in machine learning, and improvements in wireless technology will manifest the future of health care as personal, ubiquitous, and collaborative.

AB Retrospectively visible cancers are defined as interval cancers or screen-detected cancers (missed cancers) which are judged visible on prior screening mammogram. There are two kinds of retrospectively visible cancers: "actionable" cancers and nonspecific findings that do not warrant recall in normal practice. Nonspecific findings are twice more frequent than actionable cancers. The rate of missed breast cancers in screening is estimated at 25% (13-41%). Missed breast cancers are masses or calcifications. Masses are twice more frequent than calcifications. Missed breast cancers result from detection errors (location in retroglandular region or at the edge of glandular tissue, architectural distorsion) and interpretation errors (findings judged as benign). Detection errors could be limited by double reading and CAD, interpretation errors by better knowledge of BIRADS classification which needs specific training.

AB Health-care managers are increasingly interested in client perceptions of clinic service quality and satisfaction. While tremendous progress has occurred, additional perspectives on the conceptualization, modeling and measurement of these constructs may further assist health-care managers seeking to provide high-quality care. To that end, this study draws on theories from business and health to develop an integrated model featuring antecedents to and consequences of reproductive health-care client satisfaction. In addition to developing a new model, this study contributes by testing how well Western-based theories of client satisfaction hold in a developing, Asian country. Applied to urban, reproductive health clinic users in Hanoi, Vietnam, test results suggest that hypothesized antecedents such as pre-visit expectations, perceived clinic performance and how much performance exceeds expectations impact client satisfaction. However, the relative importance of these predictors appears to vary depending on a client's level of service-related experience. Finally, higher levels of client satisfaction are positively related to future clinic use intentions. This study demonstrates the value of: (1) incorporating theoretical perspectives from multiple disciplines to model processes underlying health-care satisfaction and (2) field testing those models before implementation. It also furthers research designed to provide health-care managers with actionable measures of the complex processes related to their clients' satisfaction.

AB The influence of sampling variables on the concentration of the dopamine metabolites 3-methoxytyramine (3MT), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA) was examined in equine urine. A logarithmic transformation of the data for all horses gave distribution which approximated the normal distributions for each metabolite. The mean urinary concentration of 3 MT in horses was 214 ng/mL and the application of a threshold with a probability of 1 in 10,000 gave an actionable level of 4 microg/mL. Environmental variables were not forensically significant in determining the population distribution. HVA was not found to be a reliable indicator of dopamine or levodopa administration.

AB BACKGROUND: Strategies to reduce health expenditures through the improvement of health and quality of care are in high demand. A group of experts formed a nonpartisan, independent work group, under the sponsorship of the National Managed Health Care Congress. Its goal was to establish a list of easy-to-understand, actionable, and usable recommendations to enable disease management program advocates to conduct basic-level evaluations.; RECOMMENDATIONS: The work group made recommendations concerning identification of reference and intervention population, population definitions, quantitative methods and data quality, confounding and bias, and stakeholder agreements/contracting.; CASE STUDY: A case study was created to quantitatively illustrate some of the major issues raised by the work group. Five typical errors were simulated by applying different rules to the intervention population than to the reference population: differential inclusion (high versus low risk), differential exclusion (high versus low risk) and differential claims run-out. Compared with the true impact, four of the five errors resulted in a bias toward "intervention effect," while one (differential inclusion of high-risk patients) was biased against the "intervention effect." The direction and magnitude of the bias in natural settings will not necessarily follow this pattern.

AB OBJECTIVES: To implement a large-scale multifaceted intervention consisting of physician education, profiling, and a financial incentive, to improve treatment quality for acute sinusitis.; STUDY DESIGN: Cohort trial using a historical control of treatment patterns among approximately 500 internists, 200 family practitioners, and 200 pediatricians in a northeastern community-wide individual practice association.; PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Episode treatment group methods were adapted to identify cases (episodes) and to assess care patterns for acute sinusitis among 420,000 health maintenance organization patients seen between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001. The intervention consisted of care pathway development, physician and patient education, physician profiling, and a financial incentive.; RESULTS: A statistical process control chart showed a shift toward recommended treatment patterns after our intervention. The rate of exceptions per episode of acute sinusitis decreased 20%, from 326 exceptions per 1000 episodes between January 1, 1999, and October 31, 2000, to 261 between November 1, 2000, and December 31, 2001. Decreased use of less effective or inappropriate antibiotics accounted for most of the change (199 to 136 exceptions per 1000 episodes [32% change]). Azithromycin use decreased 30%, from 97 to 68 prescriptions per 1000 episodes. Firstline antibiotic (amoxicillin and doxycycline) use increased 14%, from 451 to 514 prescriptions per 1000 episodes. Inappropriate radiology use decreased 20%, from 15 to 12 per 1000 episodes. These changes were significant at P < .005.; CONCLUSION: A multifaceted program, including education, physician profiling with actionable recommendations, and a financial incentive, significantly increased physicians' adherence to a community-developed care pathway and was successful at improving adherence to recommended patterns of antibiotic use in acute sinusitis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and describe an integrative medicine clinic including its patients; their presenting problems, medical objectives, treatment recommendations; whether recommendations were recalled and adhered to; and patients' self-reported health outcomes.; DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 160 new clinic patients were treated using a wide range of integrative medicine therapies. Patients were interviewed at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months after their initial visit.; SETTING: The study was conducted at the Institute for Health and Healing clinic, at California Pacific Medical Center located in San Francisco, CA.; SUBJECTS: The subjects were new clinic patients seeking care for a variety of symptoms and diagnoses.; INTERVENTION: Patients presented with an average of 4.0 symptoms and 2.9 diagnoses; physicians recommended 9.5 "treatments" per patient.; RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, symptom intensity decreased from 6.5 to 4.2 (on a 10-point scale; p < 0.005); and 57% of the patients had made "substantial" progress or had completely achieved their health objectives (p < 0.005). The Short Form 12 (SF-12) measure of mental and physical functioning improved significantly from baseline to one month (p = 0.05; p = 0.001, respectively) and maintained this improvement at 3 (p = 0.01; p = 0.01) and 6 months (p = 0.001; p = .001). At 1-month follow-up, patients recalled 57% of the actionable statements from the physician without a prompt and they followed 55% of all recommendations well (90% or above). Over the follow-up period, patients increasingly attributed the reductions in symptoms (p = 0.01) and achieving their health objectives (p = 0.01) to the treatment plan. Self-reported measures of days ill and days missed at work/school did not differ significantly from the year before coming to the clinic.; CONCLUSION: The results indicate that patients can recall and follow a complex treatment regimen. Subjective and objective measures of patients' health status improved after one month and this effect was sustained or improved further at 6 months follow-up.

AB BACKGROUND: Though many patients and physicians believe that they should discuss out-of-pocket costs, research suggests that they infrequently do.; OBJECTIVE: To examine barriers preventing patient-physician communication about out-of-pocket costs among study subjects recalling a time when they wanted to discuss these costs but did not do so.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional surveys of 133 general internists and 484 of their patients from 3 academic and 18 community practices in a large midwestern metropolitan region.; MEASUREMENTS: Patient- and physician-reported barriers to discussing out-of-pocket costs.; MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 54 patients (11%) and 27 physicians (20%) were able to recall a specific time when they wanted to discuss out-of-pocket costs but did not do so. Among patients, a wide variety of barriers were reported including their own discomfort (19%), insufficient time (13%), a belief that their physician did not have a viable solution (11%), and concerns about the impact of discussions on quality of care (9%). Among physicians, the most common barriers reported were insufficient time (67%) and a belief that they did not have a solution to offer (19%).; CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to promote discussions of out-of-pocket costs should emphasize the legitimacy of patients' concerns and brief actionable alternatives that physicians can take to address them.

AB PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the role of computer-aided detection (CAD) in reducing the rate of false-negative (FN) findings on screening mammograms considered normal at initial double reading.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the authors' institution, independent prospective double readings in which the second reader is not blinded to results of the first reading are performed routinely for all mammograms. When cancer is diagnosed, prior mammograms also are reviewed with double reading to determine cancer visibility. Findings are categorized as (a) no evidence of cancer on any prior screening mammogram and patient presents more than 1 year after prior screening, (b) no evidence of cancer on any prior screening mammogram and patient presents with symptoms within 1 year after prior screening (year-interval occult false-negative), or (c) cancer visible. The clinical director separately evaluates each case in the same way. In 2000, 519 histologically proved breast cancers were diagnosed, including 132 for which patients sought a second opinion and FN findings were not tracked. Prior screening mammograms were available in 318 of the other 387 cases. Five radiologists in two reading sessions independently reviewed current and prior mammograms to categorize visible cancers as either threshold or actionable FN findings. Visible cancers deemed actionable by at least three of five readers were analyzed with a commercially available CAD system. FN rates were calculated prior to and after CAD analysis.; RESULTS: Twenty-seven occult and 71 visible cancers were found (total FN findings, 98). Three of five readers considered 52 (73%) of 71 visible cancers actionable. The CAD system correctly marked 37 (71%) of these 52 on prior screening mammograms (19 [65%] of 29 masses, seven [88%] of eight microcalcifications, seven [78%] of nine architectural distortions, and four [67%] of six masses with microcalcifications). The FN rate was 98 (31%) of 318 before CAD and 61 (19%) of 318 after CAD.; CONCLUSION: In this retrospective review of this small subset of cancers, it appears that CAD has the potential to decrease the FN rate at double reading by more than one-third (from 31% to 19%). The CAD system correctly marked 37 (71%) of 52 actionable findings read as negative in previous screening years. Copyright RSNA, 2004

AB BACKGROUND: Despite a national focus on the problem of medication safety, few studies have examined the frequency, causes, and factors contributing to discrepancies between the medications prescribed in acute care settings and what elderly patients (age>or=65 years) actually take after their discharge.; OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to develop a new instrument, the Medication Discrepancy Tool (MDT), for use by multiple practitioners across the continuum of care and to assess the MDT's reliability among nurses, pharmacists, and physicians, all of whom play a part in the formulation and administration of medication regimens for patients in transition.; METHODS: The study was conducted in a vertically integrated health care system and at a geriatric clinic in an academic health center. We applied the MDT to a series of 20 clinical vignettes based on actual cases involving older patients discharged from a community hospital to home. The interrater reliability of the MDT was assessed by asking clinicians (2 home health care nurses, 2 doctoral-trained geriatric pharmacists, and 2 physicians) to use this tool to rate the clinical vignettes. Reliability comparisons were then made within and across clinical disciplines. Intrarater reliability was also determined.; RESULTS: Across all 3 clinical disciplines, the mean interrater reliability (kappa) for the 20 vignettes was 0.56 (15% low agreement, 80% good agreement, and 5% excellent agreement). Within disciplines, the kappa statistic was as follows: nurses, 0.68; pharmacists, 0.50; and physicians, 0.64. Intrarater reliability ranged from 0.58 to 0.69.; CONCLUSIONS: By capturing transition-related medication discrepancies, the MDT fills an important gap in national efforts to promote patient safety. MDT items are actionable at both the patient and system level, suggesting that this tool could be used to foster continuous quality improvement efforts.

AB Formative research findings from 10 focus group interviews on botulism are described. Data were collected from a diverse sample of people throughout the United States in 2003, as part of a collaborative multisite initiative sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve communications materials on bioterrorism agents. Focus group guides included questions on knowledge, action, emotions, and information seeking in response to a series of scenarios on a hypothetical terrorist attack using botulinum toxin. Data were collected, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using content domains based on risk and health communications theories. Initial participant responses to scenarios were emotional, changing into immediate health and survival concerns conceptualized as information specific to the agent and event. Knowledge about botulism was low, and participants wanted clear, concise, and actionable messages. Broadcast media, the internet, and community-based sources were cited as sources of information. Findings have implications for botulism preparedness messages and for general public risk communications.

AB Dysregulation of lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the progression of many diseases and in adverse drug response. Changes in lipid metabolism leading to disease are often not detected using biomarker analyses because these changes are defined by a subtle, long-term shift in the concentrations of many metabolites simultaneously. The application of the principals of 'omics to the study of lipids, which include the development of comprehensive, high-throughput assays and centralized reference databases, is beginning to produce an integrated and actionable knowledge of lipids and their relationship to pathology. These analytical tools and the assembled knowledge will enable the discovery, development and testing of drugs to be conducted with a deeper knowledge of their effects on lipid metabolism.

AB This study examines elderly and advanced elderly inpatients' perceptions of acute care service quality, prioritises opportunities for quality improvement, and assesses variation in patients' satisfaction with care. Psychometrically-validated postal questionnaires were sent to random samplings of patients discharged from the US acute care facilities in 2002 (n = 2,057,164). Quality improvement priorities among non-elderly (< 65 years), elderly (65-74 years), and advanced elderly (> 74 years) were similar but substantial variation was found comparing single items between age groups. Elderly and advanced elderly patients rated the quality of meals and rooms significantly lower than the non-elderly, and the advanced elderly rated treatment decision making involvement significantly lower than the other two age groups. The data reveals specific, actionable areas for quality improvement and a non-linear relationship between age and satisfaction. Findings question assumptions regarding older patients' evaluations of care and indicate directions for quality improvement that account for their unique needs.

AB One of the most popular management tools in the world, the mission statement also is subject to widespread criticism. In order to improve our understanding of the mission statement's strategic value and to provide actionable recommendations for healthcare organizations, the paper adopted a social constructionist perspective in a mission statement study conducted among Canadian hospital executives. The paper found seven factors underlying 23 possible mission statement content items. Four of these (grand inspiration, benefactors, competitive orientation and business definition) corresponded to the dimensions of dominant managerial logic proposed by von Krogh and Grand, and were positively related to various behavioral, financial performance and mission achievement measures. The findings indicate that not all mission statement components are created equal and that the recommendations of major strategy texts may require reconsideration where this particular institutional context is concerned.

AB Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, costly, and clinically serious. Several national and international practice guidelines have been developed to promote more appropriate, cost-effective care for patients with CAP. This article compares and contrasts eight international practice guidelines for the management of CAP, describes the extent to which recommendations are reflected in practice, and proposes explanations for non-adherence to guidelines. We found consistency in recommendations across all the guidelines for the management of patients with CAP requiring intensive care. In this setting, all guidelines recommend chest radiography, sputum Gram stain and culture, blood cultures, testing for Legionella pneumophila, and timely administration of antibiotics active against both typical (i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae) and atypical organisms (i.e. Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae). Recommendations for the management of the average inpatient with pneumonia were more variable, with the greatest differences between the North American and European guidelines. The North American guidelines (in contrast to European ones), recommended empiric treatment of typical and atypical organisms in all inpatients. There were also differences in policies regarding the necessity of chest radiography, sputum studies, and serologic testing. Some guidelines explicitly embrace the use of prediction rules to inform the decision to hospitalize, while others do not. Some of these admission decision algorithms focus on identifying low risk patients, while others are most concerned with high risk patients. There was also considerable variation in the specificity and operationalization of clinical criteria for switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics or judging appropriateness for discharge. Many recommendations for key management decisions tended to lack explicit, objective, and actionable criteria that could be easily implemented in real world practice. Review of the pneumonia literature revealed that physician performance of guideline-recommended best practices is often suboptimal. Administration of timely antibiotics (< or =8 hours of presentation) and use of first-line antibiotics occurred in 75-85% and 18-79% of cases, respectively. Collection of blood cultures within 24 hours of presentation and prior to administration of antibiotics was achieved in 69-83% and 63-82% of cases, respectively. Screening the eligibility of CAP patients for hospital-based pneumococcal and influenza vaccination occurred on average in 11 and 14% of hospitalizations, respectively, in the US. Lack of awareness of guidelines, conflicting advice among them, and lack of specific, objective, actionable recommendations most likely contribute to nonadherence to CAP guidelines. Increased attention to these factors will be needed if professional society practice guidelines are to fulfill their promise as tools for improving the quality and outcomes of care for patients with pneumonia.

AB RATIONALES AND OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of a high sensitivity in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for detecting lung nodules in chest radiographs when extremely subtle cases were presented to radiologists.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: The chest radiographs used in this study consisted of 36 normal images and 54 abnormals containing solitary lung nodules, of which 25 were extremely subtle and 29 were very subtle. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for detecting lung nodules was performed without and with CAD. The levels of CAD output were simulated with a hypothetical ideal performance of 100% sensitivity, but with three or four false positives per image. Six radiologists participated in an observer study in which cases were interpreted first without and then with the use of CAD.; RESULTS: The average A(z) values for radiologists without and with CAD were 0.682 and 0.808, respectively. The performance of radiologists was improved significantly when high sensitivity was used (P = .0003). However, the radiologists were not able to recognize some extremely subtle nodules (5 of 54 nodules by all radiologists), even with the correct CAD output; these nodules were then considered as non-actionable. None of 306 computer-false positives was incorrectly regarded as a nodule by all radiologists, but 63 false positives were incorrectly identified by one or more radiologists.; CONCLUSION: The accuracy of radiologists in the detection of some extremely subtle solitary pulmonary nodules can be improved significantly when the sensitivity of a CAD scheme can be made to be at an extremely high level. However, all of the six radiologists failed to identify some nodules (about 10%), even with the correct output of the CAD.

AB OBJECTIVE: Computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms have successfully revealed breast masses and microcalcifications on screening mammography. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of commercially available CAD systems for revealing architectural distortion, the third most common appearance of breast cancer.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two commercially available CAD systems were used to evaluate screening mammograms obtained in 43 patients with 45 mammographically detected regions of architectural distortion. For each CAD system, we determined the sensitivity for revealing architectural distortion on at least one image of the two-view mammographic examination (case sensitivity) and for each individual mammogram (image sensitivity). Surgical biopsy results were available for each case of architectural distortion.; RESULTS: Architectural distortion was deemed present and actionable by a panel of expert breast imagers in 80 views of the 45 cases. One CAD system detected distortion in 22 of 45 cases of distortion (case sensitivity, 49%) and in 30 of 80 mammograms (image sensitivity, 38%); it displayed 0.7 false-positive marks per image. Another CAD system identified distortion in 15 of 45 cases (case sensitivity, 33%) and 17 of 80 mammograms (image sensitivity, 21%); it displayed 1.27 false-positive marks per image. Sensitivity for malignancy-caused distortion was similar to or lower than sensitivity for all causes of distortion.; CONCLUSION: Fewer than one half of the cases of architectural distortion were detected by the two most widely available CAD systems used for interpretations of screening mammograms. Considerable improvement in the sensitivity of CAD systems is needed for detecting this type of lesion. Practicing breast imagers who use CAD systems should remain vigilant for architectural distortion.

AB Transforming organizational research data into actionable information nurses can use to improve patient outcomes remains a challenge. Available data are numerous, at multiple levels of analysis, and snapshots in time, which makes application difficult in a dynamically changing healthcare system. One potential solution is computational modeling. We describe our use of OrgAhead, a theoretically based computational modeling program developed at Carnegie Mellon University, to transform data into actionable nursing information. We calibrated the model by using data from 16 actual patient care units to adjust model parameters until performance of simulated units ordered in the same way as observed performance of the actual units 80% of the time. In future research, we will use OrgAhead to generate hypotheses about changes nurses might make to improve patient outcomes, help nurses use these hypotheses to identify and implement changes on their units, and then measure the impact of those changes on patient outcomes.

AB A facilitated group discussion approach was used to explore how a group of eight low-income consumers perceive, understand, and use the current food label for food-shopping decisions. Meeting for one hour on three consecutive weeks in a community facility, the group discussed the total food package, the ingredient list alone and in combination with the nutrition-information panel, and nutrition claims. All sessions were recorded and later transcribed verbatim. Through inductive analysis, three broad categories (brand name, package feature, and nutrition-related information) and numerous underlying themes emerged from the data; a theoretical framework was proposed to explain the data and provide future direction. A number of barriers to effective use of the food label were identified, and some actionable tips for dietetic practice were suggested.

AB A workshop was designed to (1) present results of the Core Competencies for Veterinary Medicine project conducted by Personnel Decisions International (PDI); (2) discuss and analyze the implications of the PDI study results for academia, private practice, and industry; (3) identify actionable items-discuss opportunities and barriers; and (4) develop appropriate recommendations-devise specific actions for implementation as next steps. In total, 25 veterinary colleges were represented at the workshop and a total of 110 attendees participated, a broad cross-section of the veterinary profession (both academic and non-academic). Through an orchestrated combination of general sessions and facilitated, small group discussions, prioritized recommendations for implementation and initial action plans for next steps were developed. Recommendations included publicizing results of the PDI study, reconsidering current admissions policies and processes, evaluating the applicant pool and current recruitment programs, developing structured mentoring programs, enhancing DVM/VMD training programs, coordinating the development of continuing education programs, and overcoming existing barriers to change. Next steps should involve collaborative efforts across all sectors of the veterinary profession to develop plans for implementing the workshop's recommendations. Leadership for follow-up might reasonably come from the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), either individually or collectively, through the National Commission on Veterinary Economic Issues (NCVEI). Partnerships with industry are also possible and should be strongly considered.

AB This study used a mixed method to test a model of demands on nurses. Factors were identified that affect demands, and a model was tested using structural equation modeling. Teamwork and expertise had significant effects on nurse-sensitive outcomes. Leadership was a strong determinant of stability and expertise. Workload was not a significant predictor of outcomes, but this is likely due to the difficulty in measuring nursing work. These results provide administrators with actionable recommendations that can be used to reduce the demands on nursing staff.

AB Five questions--What should be transferred to decision makers? To whom should it be transferred? By whom? How? With what effect?--provide an organizing framework for a knowledge transfer strategy. Opportunities for improving how research organizations transfer research knowledge can be found in the differences between the answers suggested by our understanding of the research literature and those provided by research-organization directors asked to describe what they do. In Canada, these opportunities include developing actionable messages for decision makers (only 30 percent of research organizations frequently or always do this), developing knowledge-uptake skills in target audiences and knowledge-transfer skills in research organizations (only 20 to 22 percent frequently or always do this), and evaluating the impact of knowledge-transfer activities (only 8 to 12 percent frequently or always conduct an evaluation). Research funders can help research organizations take advantage of these opportunities.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and test a core set of questions to measure patients' experiences of in-patient care. Questions were selected from the bank of items developed for use in in-patient surveys undertaken by the Picker Institute for the purposes of assessing the quality of care.; DESIGN: The data reported here come from surveys of patients who had attended acute care hospitals in five countries: the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA. Questionnaires were mailed to patients' homes within 1 month of discharge, either to all patients, or to a random sample, discharged during a specified period.; SAMPLE: A total of 62 925 questionnaires were returned, with response rates of 65% (UK), 74% (Germany), 63% (Sweden), 52% (Switzerland), and 46% (USA).; RESULTS: Fifteen items were selected from the bank of questions included in the Picker in-patient questionnaires. These items have a high degree of face validity and when summed to an index they show a high degree of construct validity and internal reliability consistency.; DISCUSSION: Fifteen items derived from the longer form Picker in-patient survey have been found to provide a meaningful picture of patient experiences of health care, and constitute the 15-item Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire. These questions comprise a core set that should be measured in all in-patient facility surveys. The Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire represents a step forward in the measurement of patient experience as it provides a core set of questions around which further optional modules may be added. Scores are easy to interpret and actionable.; CONCLUSION: This small set of questions could be incorporated into in-patient surveys in different settings, enabling the comparison of hospital performance and the establishment of national or international benchmarks.

AB BACKGROUND: The patient safety program in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) began in 1998, when the National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) was established to lead the effort on a day-to-day basis. NCPS provides the structure, training, and tools, and VA facilities provide front-line expertise, feedback about the process, and root cause analysis (RCA) of adverse events and close calls.; MONITORING THE PROCESS: Facility patient safety managers determine the disposition of adverse events and close calls occurring at their facilities. They use a safety assessment code (SAC) to prioritize the actual and potential severity and frequency of an event. BEFORE-AND-AFTER STUDY: Before the new RCA system was implemented in 2000, the VA used another adverse event reporting system, focused review (FR). A comparison of the two processes indicates that the RCA process has shifted analyses of adverse events toward a human factors engineering approach-entailing a search for system vulnerabilities rather than human errors and other less actionable root causes.; CASE EXAMPLES: Two case examples--on hazards in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) room and on a cardiac pacemaker malfunction--illustrate how the RCA system works in actual operation. The cases illustrate that broadly applicable, high-impact actions can result from a thorough RCA process.; DISCUSSION: NCPS monitors the quality and completeness of RCAs through the immediate review and feedback process. Still to be investigated is the effectiveness of RCA actions addressing the hypothesized root causes and contributing factors of the close calls and adverse events.

AB Disease management is an approach to patient care that coordinates medical resources for the patient across the entire healthcare delivery system throughout the lifetime of the patient with the disease. Stroke is suitable for disease management as it is a well-known disease with a high prevalence, high cost, variable practice pattern, poor clinical outcome, and managed by a non-integrated healthcare system. It has measurable and actionable outcomes, with available local expertise and support of the Ministry of Health. Developing the programme requires a multidisciplinary team, baseline data on target populations and healthcare services, identification of core components, collaboration with key stakeholders, development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and carepaths, institution of care coordinators, use of information technology and continuous quality improvement to produce an effective plan. Core components include public education, risk factor screening and management, primary care and specialist clinics, acute stroke units, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and supportive community services including medical, nursing, therapy, home help and support groups for patients and carers. The family physician plays a key role. Coordination of services is best done by a network of hospital and community-based care managers, and is enhanced by a coordinating call centre. Continuous quality improvement is required, with audit of processes and outcomes, facilitated by a disease registry. Pitfalls include inappropriate exclusion of deserving patients, misuse, loss of physician and patient independence, over-estimation of benefits, and care fragmentation. Collaboration and cooperative among all parties will help ensure a successful and sustainable programme.

AB Societies globally have a long road ahead in eliminating health risks and discrepancies due to race and ethnicity, gender, culture, and illiteracy. In terms of race, for example, females and African-Americans are less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization, and Caucasians are more likely than minorities to receive pain management in the emergency room. Regarding gender, physiologic differences certainly account for some divergent health outcomes, but they do not explain how women and men have different prevalences of diseases that are not obviously gender-specific. Cultural beliefs play a vital role in determining health choices, and health care professionals need a deeper understanding of these beliefs prior to promoting certain health interventions. Illiteracy may also prevent a person from following health instructions, and the strong association between illiteracy and poverty may exert powerful, negative influences on health outcomes. Employing the characteristics of social marketing (synchronous messages, reinforcement, and actionability) may help society to overcome some of the obstacles.

AB The true utility of quality measurement lies in its ability to inspire quality improvement, with resultant enhancements in the processes and outcomes of care. Because quality measurement is expensive, it is difficult to justify using measures that are not likely to lead to important improvements in health. Many current measures of chronic disease technical quality, however, have one or more pitfalls that prevent them from motivating quality improvement reactions. These pitfalls include that: (1) measured processes of care lack strong links to outcomes; (2) actionable processes of care are not measured; (3) measures do not target those at highest risk; (4) measures do not allow for patient exceptions; and (5) intermediate outcome measures are not severity adjusted. To exemplify recent advancements and current pitfalls in chronic disease quality measurement, we examine the evolution of quality measures for diabetes mellitus and discuss the limitations of many currently used diabetes mellitus care measures. We then propose more clinically meaningful "tightly linked" measures that examine clinical processes directly linked to outcomes, target populations with specific diagnoses or intermediate disease outcomes that contribute to risk for poor downstream health outcomes, and explicitly incorporate exceptions. We believe that using more tightly linked measures in quality assessment will identify important quality of care problems and is more likely to produce improved outcomes for those with chronic diseases.

AB An analysis of the relationship between intermediate outcomes and duration of dialysis therapy in hemodialysis patients was performed by linking Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Core Indicators data with data obtained from HCFA form 2728 at the initiation of dialysis therapy. Patients who recently initiated hemodialysis therapy were less likely to meet Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines than patients with a longer duration of dialysis therapy. For both urea reduction ratio and Kt/V, odds ratios for adequate dialysis were approximately 0.20 for a duration of dialysis therapy less than 0.5 years and 0.42 to 0.63 for a duration of dialysis therapy of 0.5 to 1.0 years compared with a duration of dialysis therapy of 2.0 years or greater. For patients with a duration of dialysis therapy less than 0.5 years (compared with >/=2.0 years), the odds ratio for a hematocrit less than 28% was approximately 3.0, that for a hematocrit 33% or greater was approximately 0.6, and that for a serum albumin level of 3.5 g/dL or greater (bromcresol green method) or 3.2 g/dL or greater (bromcresol purple method) was approximately 0.4. There was a direct relationship between glomerular filtration rate at the initiation of dialysis therapy and both serum albumin and hematocrit values. Patients administered recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) predialysis were more likely to have greater hematocrits. There also was a direct relationship between hematocrit and serum albumin level. Therefore, several actionable items in regard to attentive overall medical care can result in an improvement in the percentage of patients newly started on hemodialysis therapy who meet intermediate outcomes, including the administration of rHuEPO predialysis, correction of iron deficiency, and timely placement of a permanent dialysis access.

A group of individuals knowledgeable about HTA in Canada, Germany, Romania and Spain, along with representatives of the University of Tartu, Estonia, was convened by the Institute of Health Economics in Edmonton, Canada, to consider options for such a function. In a one-day workshop strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analyses of HTA were conducted, first at a 'global' level, and then of the Estonian situation. The 'global' SWOT analysis yielded a large number of items that pertain to institutionalized HTA in a generic sense, i.e. not based on any individual HTA agency. The 'Estonian' SWOT yielded a subset of items, which pertain to development of HTA in that country. Ten actionable steps were then developed on the basis of this subset, which could be used to initiate the creation of an HTA body in Estonia.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Toolkit After-Death Bereaved Family Member Interview to measure quality of care at the end of life from the unique perspective of family members. The survey included proposed problem scores (a count of the opportunity to improve the quality of care) and scales. Data were collected through a retrospective telephone survey with a family member who was interviewed between 3 and 6 months after the death of the patient. The setting was an outpatient hospice service, a consortium of nursing homes, and a hospital in New England. One hundred fifty-six family members from across these settings participated. The 8 proposed domains of care, as represented by problem scores or scales, were based on a conceptual model of patient-focused, family-centered medical care. The survey design emphasized face validity in order to provide actionable information to health care providers. A correlational and factor analysis was undertaken of the 8 proposed problem scores or scales. Cronbach's alpha scores varied from 0.58 to 0.87, with two problem scores (each of which had only 3 survey items) having a low alpha of 0.58. The mean item-to-total correlations for the other problem scores varied from 0.36 to 0.69, and the mean item-to-item correlations were between 0.32 and 0.70. The proposed problem scores or scales, with the exception of closure and advance care planning, demonstrated a moderate correlation (i.e., from 0.44 to 0.52) with the overall rating of satisfaction (as measured by a five-point, "excellent" to "poor" scale). Family members of persons who died with hospice service reported fewer problems in each of the six domains of medical care, gave a higher rating of the quality of care, and reported higher self-efficacy in caring for their loved ones. These results indicate that 7 of the 8 proposed problem scores or scales demonstrated psychometric properties that warrant further testing. The domain of closure demonstrated a poor correlation with overall satisfaction and requires further work. This survey could provide information to help guide quality improvement efforts to enhance the care of the dying.

AB One may divide patient care problem-solving approaches into two categories: (1) "Ready, aim, fire" and (2) "Ready, fire, aim." The present paper invites the reader to think about these distinctions and to identify which of these categories might apply to the reader's daily work experience. Espousing the first of these categories, and anchored in the notions of systems thinking, this paper offers the reader a framework to better understand and implement the daily work of the newborn intensive care unit. This knowledge and competence may be achieved by "thinking upstream," connecting "downstream" outcomes with "upstream" work process steps. The central elements that govern and inform the process of "thinking upstream" are articulated here in actionable terms.

AB 1. Respirators can be the last defense for the estimated 5 million employees who use them for protection from dusts and fibers, fumes, mists, gases, vapors, and biological hazards. Because of these potentially lethal respiratory hazards, occupational and environmental health nurses need to be able to determine the need for, understand, develop, update, and implement an actionable respiratory protection program (RPP). 2. Regulated per 29 CFR 1910.134, a written RPP becomes the map or guideline process specific to the workplace that needs to be followed to ensure employee protection. 3. The nine required written elements of a RPP include respirator selection; fit testing; respirator use in routine and emergency situations; respirator maintenance and change schedules; ensuring adequate breathing air supply, quantity, and flow for atmosphere supplying respirators; regular evaluation of program effectiveness; medical evaluation; training employees in the respiratory hazards in routine and emergent situations; and training employees in proper use of the respirator. 4. Occupational and environmental health nurses are in a unique position to be a RPP program administrator, its designated licensed health care professional, or an active member of a team implementing the RPP process.

AB Although consumers say they are concerned about nutrition and are aware that eating a healthful diet is important for good health, this knowledge does not always translate into healthful diet behaviors or motivate behavior change. In an effort to better understand consumer attitudes about nutrition and to explore alternatives for communicating dietary advice in language that is meaningful and motivates behavior change, the International Food Information Council (IFIC) conducted qualitative research with consumers (using focus groups) and registered dietitians (using telephone interviews) in 1998 and 1999. Results of the research are presented using dietary fat as a case study. Findings from the IFIC research were reported to the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee to assist the Committee in developing meaningful and action-oriented dietary advice related to dietary fat for inclusion in the 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that would be motivating and easy for consumers to implement. The recommendation to moderate fat intake in the new dietary guideline, "Choose a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and moderate in total fat" is consistent with communication recommendations in the IFIC research. Further, the moderate fat message is empowering because it suggests an achievable dietary regimen and reduces guilt and worry about foods. It allows flexibility to enjoy desired foods and promotes using common sense when it comes to diet. Several issues emerged from the IFIC research that apply to general nutrition communications with consumers, whether it be through national nutrition recommendations or in one-on-one counseling situations: to be effective, messages to consumers about nutrition, and specifically dietary fat, must address sources of discomfort about dietary choices; they must engender a sense of empowerment; and they should motivate both by providing clear information that propels toward taking action and appeals to the need to make personal choices.

AB The assertion about the unique 'complexity' or the peculiarly intricate character of social phenomena has, at least within sociology, a long, venerable and virtually uncontested tradition. At the turn of the last century, classical social theorists, for example, Georg Simmel and Emile Durkheim, made prominent and repeated reference to this attribute of the subject matter of sociology and the degree to which it complicates, even inhibits the develop and application of social scientific knowledge. Our paper explores the origins, the basis and the consequences of this assertion and asks in particular whether the classic complexity assertion still deserves to be invoked in analyses that ask about the production and the utilization of social scientific knowledge in modern society. We present John Maynard Keynes' economic theory and its practical applications as an illustration. We conclude that the practical value of social scientific knowledge is not dependent on a faithful, in the sense of complete, representation of social reality. Instead, social scientific knowledge that wants to optimize its practicality has to attend and attach itself to elements of social situations that can be altered or are actionable.

AB When CEOs push decision making out to the far reaches of an organization, good things happen: fleeting business opportunities are seized quickly and workers are motivated to innovate and take risks. But it's tricky to achieve both decentralized decision making and coherent strategic action at a company. If everyone is a decision maker, things can spin out of control. In this article, Bain consultants Orit Gadiesh and James Gilbert explore the concept of the strategic principle--a memorable and actionable phrase that distills a company's corporate strategy into its unique essence and communicates it across an organization. If it's devised and disseminated properly, a strategic principle can empower employees to seize business opportunities but also focus everyone in an organization--executives and line managers alike--on the same strategic objectives. The authors outline the three defining characteristics of a good strategic principle--it should force trade-offs between competing resource demands, it should serve as a test for the strategic soundness of a particular action, and it should set clear boundaries for employees to operate within even as it grants them freedom to experiment. They explain how managers can create a strategic principle, how they should test it, and when they should revisit it. The authors present real-world examples of how companies use their strategic principles. For instance, they describe how South-west Airlines stopped flying to Denver after it measured the high costs of providing flight service in that part of the country against its strategic principle of offering customers short-haul air travel at fares competitive with the cost of automobile travel. This tool is increasingly useful in today's rapidly changing business environment, the authors conclude, and it is likely to become even more crucial to corporate success.

In 1998, the Board of Governors of West Park Hospital (now West Park Healthcare Centre) used the 360 degree feedback technique for the first time to gather feedback from a range of stakeholders. Boards members found the technology accessible and the process valuable.  They are using the individual results to improve individual performance, and have developed work plans to address areas for continued board development.

This article describes how information technology can now be used to provide clinicians with access to both insight and information that is context- and event-sensitive. Collaboration between the American College of Physicians, medical knowledge experts, Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU), and shared medical systems for framework and infrastructure combine to create the ideal environment of complementary and synergistic competencies. This article describes the research that is under way at OHSU to determine how to deploy medical knowledge derived from these sources and integrate it into the clinical workflow; it also examines a vision of how medical knowledge can be integrated in the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: To use pharmacy and laboratory data to assess diabetes care within a medical group and between medical groups and to determine dispensing patterns and the extent to which providers change therapy based on HbA1c results.; RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participating groups submitted 1 year of data for continuously enrolled patients. Required data included date of birth, all diabetes-specific prescriptions (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin), date of prescription, National Drug Code, all HbA1c values, lower and upper normal limits, and date of testing.; RESULTS: Few changes in therapy were noted despite the large percentages of patients with suboptimal control. Nearly 90% of the patients treated with medications received a monotherapy regimen involving one of three therapeutic agents: sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin. More than three-fourths of the patients remained on the same therapy during the observation period despite the fact that 27% of these patients had HbA1c values > or = 8%. Nearly one-fifth (18%) of patients had an HbA1c level of > or = 8% and no further testing for at least 90 days after the "actionable" HbA1C result was obtained. Furthermore, 54% of patients with actionable HbA1c results did not have a change in therapy initiated after the result was available.; CONCLUSIONS: The American Diabetes Association recommendations to act on HbA1c values > or = 8% and to follow up regularly on patients found to be in suboptimal control do not appear to be applied in a consistent manner based on the pharmacy and laboratory data analyzed in this sample.

AB Rare, but serious, the possible accidents of medical or surgical procedures without fault compromise the doctor patient relationship. A pro-compensation philosophy leads to a drift in the classical concept of prejudicial act. This type of confusion adds a random/aleatory legal risk to the random/aleatory medical risk. Determining the limit between random/aleatory risk and malpractice is one of the difficulties in medical evaluation of responsibility. In order to evaluate the random/aleatory risk without malpractice, in relationship to the medical team, we propose a notation grid for the facts of the case, based on simple, precise, identifiable criteria present in all medical records and accepted by both the practising physicians and medico legal experts. This medico-legal research was done in a double blind study of 45 cases which intially brought up a random/aleatory risk related problem for three medical procedures: coronary arteriography, colonoscopy and laparascopy. In 66.6% of the cases the random/aleatory risk was ruled unrelated to any malpractice, but in 33.4% of the cases observed, the initial random/aleatory risk was transformed into actionable malpractice, essentially due to faulty surveillance or tardy treatment of the complication. This notation system, carried out in identical and well defined terms, should allow a reasonable comparison of cases for medico-legal research or computerised databases. It is reserved exclusively for use by medical experts or consultants so they can give a reasoned technical opinion in order to assist the judge in his legal decision. The objective of the proposed grid is to homogenise the concepts used by experts in all national courts. After a multicenter validation, this grid could have an European future as to the boundary between random/aleatory risks and medical malpractice and responsibility.

A2 The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated sanctions against attorney
   Lee Nuwesra whose client claimed HIV discrimination. The court ruled
   that U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley abused her judicial
   discretion in ruling that Nuwesra must pay $25,000 of legal costs spent
   by the client's employer in defending itself against litigation that the
   judge found frivolous. The appeals panel faulted the judge for not
   specifying which conduct on the part of the attorney was actionable.
   Plaintiff [name removed] claimed that his firing from [name removed] &
   [name removed], Inc., was motivated by his HIV illness and that his
   rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act were violated. [Name
   removed] failed to establish that his employer knew his HIV status.
   Motley sanctioned Nuwesra for not performing adequate pre-trial
   investigation in the case. According to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
   judges can only sanction attorneys at the request of the opposing side,
   which was not made by the defendants in this case.

AB 'Know thy neighbor' is a critical component of today's biotechnology practice. The industry is extremely rich in science and business information, and the pace of change is dramatic. Successful participation in biotechnology will always depend on good technology, management and money. In addition, an ingredient that needs more attention is competitive information- gathering and analysis. Competitive intelligence can be defined as actionable information that requires the ability to filter and synthesize relevant knowledge for the benefit of the company. Why is this necessary? How can it be done well? What examples are there? These are good questions that are inevitably faced by all biotechnology practitioners, and some answers are provided herein.

AB OBJECTIVE: To help researchers better understand Medicaid managed care and the kinds of research studies that will be both feasible and of value to policymakers and program staff. The article builds on our experience researching Medicaid managed care to provide insight for researchers who want to be policy relevant.; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We draw four lessons from our work on Medicaid managed care in seven states. First, these are complex programs that differ substantially across states. Second, each program faces common challenges and issues. The need to address common design elements involving program eligibility, managed care and provider contracting, beneficiary enrollment, education, marketing, and administration and oversight provides a vehicle that researchers can use to help understand states and to provide them with relevant insight. Third, well-designed case studies can provide invaluable descriptive insights. Such case studies suggest that providing effective descriptions of state programs and experience, monitoring information on program performance and tradeoffs, and insight on implementation and design are all valuable products of such studies that have considerable potential to be converted into policy-actionable advice. And fourth, some questions demand impact studies but the structure of Medicaid managed care poses major barriers to such studies.; CONCLUSIONS: Many challenges confront researchers seeking to develop policy-relevant research on managed care. Researchers need to confront these challenges in turn by developing second-best approaches that will provide timely insight into important questions in a relatively defensible and rigorous way in the face of many constraints. If researchers do not, others will, and researchers may find their contributions limited in important areas for policy debate.

AB The purpose of this phased research project is to better understand the role of health economic arguments in the decision making process of healthcare providers and purchasers in the United Kingdom. Phase I of the research was directed at General Practitioners (GPs); in phase II we broadened the scope of the research to include different agents who influence resource allocation and the wider health care environment. The objective of phase II was to determine the relevance and appeal of diverse health economic measures to different decision makers. This phase of qualitative research involved 34 decision makers in 17 duo interviews. The study has provided a rich source of qualitative evidence on the role of health economics in decision making. The main conclusions to emerge are; different individuals seek different outcomes; health economic studies should report actionable conclusions; and any cost savings must be applicable. To succeed, economists need to demonstrate a better understanding of the contracting and budgetary processes of the National Health Service. Opinions of the value of health economic evaluations varied widely, however most respondents believed it would become increasingly influential in the prioritisation process in the National Health Service of the future.

AB Sexual harassment can arise in virtually any employment setting. Healthcare facilities must be careful to avoid sexual harassment of their employees both by other employees and by the myriad other persons who may come into contact with their employees in the workplace. Much of what makes sexual harassment an actionable offense are the perceptions of the victim. Employers should take a proactive approach to preventing, detecting and correcting instances of harassment.

AB In conclusion, it is obvious to each of us that the nursing shortage issue is complex. There are no simple solutions. In the acute care arena we can expect to see the usual recruitment wars using sign-on bonuses, increased salaries for per diem staff, internship programs and all sorts of methods used in the past to recruit needed staff. It is that sort of crisis management and short term thinking that has plagued the profession in the past. These are bandaid efforts especially in light of the factors of supply vs demand with short-term quick fixes. There must be, however, more efforts towards addressing the long-term issues such as wage compression, differentiated practice and pay, effective models of care delivery, educating the public about nursing, and public/government funding more nursing education and research at all levels. There may need to be a federal subsidy for nursing education and recruitment included to affect the magnitude of this potential societal problem. The profession is at a crossroads. One thing is certain however, this nursing shortage is different and will get worse before it gets better. Let's not let the demand for nurses become so large and supply become so small that we are an endangered species or near extinction in the new millennium. What will be the scenario for nurses in 2050? Are we, as the largest healthcare profession, so complacent about our continued existence that we are at a point of paralysis? Are we in such a state of deep depression in response to current changing environment that we will allow ourselves to be devoured by our predators. Are we cannibalistic as we eat our young and chew on our own unresolved internal issues with a lack of action? Are we septic as a result of our own self-inflicted professional wounds? Our profession must become immediately aware of our possibly tenuous future. We must work together as a community of nurses to strategically address the areas of recruitment, education, retention and environmental factors with actionable plans for short term and long term solutions. There is ample opportunity to redefine and build new paradigms and implement structures that will enhance and encourage the growth of the profession into the new millennium. Your Florida nursing professional associations, leaders, and educators are working towards solutions and invite you to help shape the future of nursing by participating actively in your professional organizations.

AB Financing of mental health care has changed radically, especially with managed care. Shrinking revenues have forced providers to look for creative ways in which to provide quality services at less expense. Delivery of quality services depends largely on the productive use of the provider's prime resource--the clinicians. Productivity was the focus of the PC-based decision support system developed for mental health providers in New York State. It enables administrators to track key indicators of productivity such as face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time against goals. Unmet goals can be pinpointed quickly, and clinicians' caseloads can be reviewed to determine the underlying causes. A key feature of the system is the conversion of raw data into actionable information to help in problem finding and problem solving. The system has been implemented in Ulster County, the pilot site for the project. The software can be customized easily to suit the data of other providers.

The authors have created a powerful disease management capability that generates dynamic, disease-specific reports containing actionable, provider-patient-level laboratory and pharmacy information. This system is used to send reports to primary care physicians in an independent practice association (IPA)-model managed care setting to improve the care of patients with diabetes mellitus. This systematic feedback methodology can augment physician decision-making behavior, promote compliance with national guidelines, and measure improvement in plan-level, population-based outcomes over time.

AB To increase the utility of administrative databases, it has been recommended that they include disease-specific, patient-centered outcome measures. This paper reviews practical and theoretical considerations and the critical evidence to support this recommendation. The strengths and weaknesses of the recommended approach are illustrated by examples of disease-specific measures for arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases. Current experience suggests that routine capture of these measures in administrative databases has formidable practical problems and would be unlikely to affect patient care. They could be used as gross indicators of a population's experience but would be insensitive to clinically meaningful improvement on the level of the individual patient. By themselves, these measures are unlikely to identify actionable strategies to improve outcomes, but they could improve efficiency. Overall, implementing this type of disease management improvement strategy would have little value in direct patient care and would be costly.

AB The False Claims Act (FCA) was invoked recently to sue the owners of a long-term-care facility for inadequate care of facility residents. The theory is simple: Medicare and Medicaid provider certification agreements require compliance with all federal and state laws applicable to the services provided. Submitting claims for reimbursement while providing inadequate care and, thus, failing to comply with the extensive nursing home quality-of-care federal and state laws, constitutes fraud on the government, actionable under the FCA. No court considered the government's theory in this case, as parties settled early in the litigation. Nevertheless, owners of facilities should not expect to rely on written patient records and case notes to avoid liability for false claims if the records are inconsistent with the physical condition of the residents.

A pharmacist failed to warn a patient accordingly and the patient suffered a stroke as a result of an interaction between tranylcypromine and a decongestant. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that this failure to warn was actionable under the theories of negligence and fraud as well as under the Michigan Consumer Protection Act.

A2 A New Jersey appeals court allowed a plaintiff to seek damages for fear
   of contracting HIV even though there was no evidence of actual exposure
   to the virus. Office cleaner [name removed] sued the medical offices of
   Drs. Waldman, Feldman, and Losman after puncturing her hand on a lancet
   that had been improperly disposed of in an ordinary trash receptacle.
   The Superior Court's Appellate Division ruled that the motions judge
   erred in dismissing [name removed]'s case because whenever a defendant's
   negligent act or omission creates a possibility of HIV exposure, a claim
   for emotional distress damages cannot be dismissed on summary judgement.
   [Name removed] has tested negative for HIV five times in three years.
   This ruling contradicts rulings in other States that have attempted to
   curb frivolous litigation by requiring the plaintiff to prove actual
   exposure to the virus. If exposure cannot be proven, damages will not be
   awarded. Recent applications of relevant State tort law include Russaw

AB OBJECTIVE: To create a legal awareness of AIDS patients' right to privacy among the medical profession.; DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Doctors should recognize confidentiality as a patient's right, since in most countries the AIDS patient is practically considered a person who is going through a punishment, having no legal rights, rather than a patient suffering from a grave illness. Originally the common law did not recognize the concept of professional secrecy as a right of the patient. It was only regarded as an ethical duty not actionable in court. But with the eruption of diseases such as AIDS, statutes requiring written authorization for the release of confidential information were enacted. A problem with our hospital records is that they are freely available to almost all the staff in the hospitals and sometimes even to outsiders. In the case of AIDS at least, strict measures should be taken to enforce secrecy in relation to all disease-related information such as sexual history, HIV status and CD4 cell counts. The duty to keep medical information confidential is not absolute. An overriding duty towards society, occurs when the benefits of disclosure outweigh its harm. This utopian argument is even more convincing when an HIV-positive person is acting irresponsibly, engaging in risky behaviour without warning the partner. All persons who have a compelling interest, such as sexual partners, needle sharers, medical and nursing personnel, should be provided with this information. It should also extend to mortuary attendants when the patient dies. A person having a STD has a legal duty to take precautions against transmission. In Berner v. Caldwell (543 So. 2d. 686), the US court held that one who knows or should reasonably know that he has genital herpes is under a duty to abstain from sex or warn others before risky contact. As doctors we should familiarize ourselves now with the concepts and laws regarding patients' rights, without waiting until a malpractice crisis develops to correct ourselves.

AB In order to be successful leading within today's "leaner and meaner" organizations, managers will need to shift their energies from handling day-to-day operations to nurturing the cultural and structural changes that tomorrow brings. This crucial process of self-improvement begins with facts about how they specifically spend their time today. These facts, in turn, are the basis for actionable recommendations. Of course, the clock is ticking as organizations view with each other on the strength of their leaders. Time, once again, is not on our side.

AB The objective of this study was to identify adverse social and medical factors contributory to post-perinatal deaths and at which stage of the case study each factor was found. The sources of information assessed were: (i) recorded data from case notes, laboratory and postmortem findings, and (ii) created information from (a) home interview and (b) case discussion held in the family doctor's office. The deaths were categorized into seven clinicopathological groups and adverse factors into general demographic and personal psychosocial. Among the 87 sequential post-perinatal infant deaths, 325 adverse factors were identified; of these, 125 (38%) were judged to be actionable by the carers. Of 183 (56%) adverse factors found in the case notes, only 36 were actionable. Forty-five more adverse factors were found at home interview; 26 (58%) of these were actionable. At case discussion another 97 adverse factors were revealed; 63 (65%) were actionable, thus proving the most important source of actionable information.

A2 Ohio's Supreme Court has ruled that a woman who was misdiagnosed with
   HIV cannot sue for damages from emotional distress since she was never
   in any physical peril. [Name removed], now [name removed], was informed
   by her physician, Richard W. Moretuzzo, that she was HIV-positive
   following a blood test in 1990. Another test by the American Red Cross
   and Akron General Hospital, using the original blood sample, confirmed
   the diagnosis. She sued all three for negligent infliction of emotional
   distress when an infectious disease specialist later retested her and
   found negative results. The court agreed that she suffered emotional
   injuries, but upheld a Summit County Appellate Court ruling dismissing
   the lawsuit. Justice Andrew Douglas wrote that state law does not
   recognize a cause of action for negligent infliction of serious
   emotional distress if no harm came to the plaintiff. Justice Alice Robie
   Resnick dissented, saying such broad prohibitions would limit recovery
   to deserving plaintiffs. She also questioned Moretuzzo's failure to draw
   a second blood sample and his disclosure of the test results by
   telephone.

AB This paper examines medical malpractice law as it applies to medically necessary oral health care. The basic legal concepts and reported cases involving medically necessary oral health care are reviewed. It is concluded that dental professionals and consumer advocates must advance their educational and legislative advocacy efforts so that health professional colleagues and the public will become aware of the importance of these services and insurers will routinely include coverage of medically necessary oral health care in their medical and dental policies. While failure to provide medically necessary oral health care can be violative of patient rights and legally actionable, medical malpractice litigation should always be the behavior modifier of last resort.

AB The results of this study indicate that the experience of sexual harassment among nursing professionals may be more widespread than previously reported. With only one percent of respondents reporting quid pro quo harassment, the vast majority of harassment fell into the hostile environment category where the victim's perceptions are all important. Health care administrators should be cautioned that harassment and discrimination are evolving and expanding areas of the law, necessitating current knowledge of the standards for actionable conduct. To lower the risk of liability from claims of both victims and the accused, harassment and discrimination policies should be aggressive, proactive, fair, and thorough.

AB This paper first looks at traditional quadrant analysis as used in contemporary research. Next, we show an extension to include multiple brands on the same quadrant chart--again consistent with current practice. Then, multiple discriminant analysis results are merged with the quadrant chart data. This makes the resultant chart even more actionable. While the example uses health care data, the methods outlined can be used in other segments of the service industry, as well as for more tangible products. The only limit is the researcher's imagination.

AB Whatever the appeal of extreme integrism or holism, science is necessarily more utilist and partial. We can only address our environmental problems scientifically if we identify the most pressing and attack them first. To do so, we must break with the monistic ideals and traditions of both theoretical and mechanistic ecology to pursue particular solutions instead of global models. Statistical analysis of empirically identified patterns has proven effective in providing such solutions, perhaps because empirical patterns are less valueladen than theoretical or mechanistic alternatives or because such patterns are closer to experience and easier to understand. Unfortunately, such simple analyses are often less valued by leading ecologists who seek intellectual content rather than predictive power and practicality. To overcome this barrier to actionable information, the body of scientists must reaffirm their commitment to environmental action through their work as journal referees, grant reviewers, scientific critics and teachers.

AB Five rapid methods for detection of antibiotics in milk were compared. The Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis disc assay was also performed on the same samples. The rapid methods were: Angenics Spot Test, Charm II, Delvotest P, Penzyme Farm, and Penzyme Lab III. Ten antibiotics (penicillin G, cephapirin, cloxacillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, and gentamicin) were used individually to spike eight raw milk samples at five levels of antibiotic. Antibiotic levels were chosen that would result in zones of <16 mm, 16 mm, and >16 mm on the disc assay. Only the disc assay, Charm II and Delvotest P were compared on non-beta-lactam antibiotics. A small percentage of milks with no antibiotic added tested positive with the Charm II and Penzyme Lab III. On combined data for penicillin G, cephapirin, and cloxacillin, for which all methods were compared, the percent correctly categorized as pass (below actionable) for the <16 mm zone spiked level, reject or caution at the 16 mm zone level, and reject or caution at the >16 mm zone level were: Angenics 79, 83, 100; Charm II 66, 92, 100; Delvotest P 74, 93, 100; Disc Assay 100, 74, 100; Penzyme Farm 93, 61, 92; Penzyme Lab III 81,78, 100 respectively. In most cases, the rapid methods showed greater apparent sensitivity than the disc assay and did not fail to reject milks spiked with antibiotic in excess of the 16 mm zone level.

AB Nineteen hen turkeys (10 to 12 kg each) were used in a feeding study to determine sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline concentrations in blood serum, liver, and skeletal muscle, as well as the respective ratios at selected withdrawal intervals. Two feeds were prepared by use of premixes to achieve 60 mg of sulfadimethoxine/kg and 100 mg of sulfaquinoxaline/kg, respectively. Each of the medicated feeds was given to 9 turkeys for 7 days. The turkeys were then fed nonmedicated feed at intervals from 24 to 56 hours and were slaughtered. One turkey was used as control. The serum/liver and serum/muscle ratios for sulfaquinoxaline were 60 to 70% higher than for sulfadimethoxine. However, the liver/muscle ratio for both sulfonamides was equivalent, approximately 3. Disposition of both sulfonamides approximated first-order pharmacokinetics. The calculated half-life of sulfadimethoxine was half that of sulfaquinoxaline, approximately 16 vs 30 hours. The coefficients of variation in the serum/tissue ratios for both sulfonamides were between 13% and 25% for serum/liver and less than 15% for serum/muscle, indicating excellent potential for using serum as a predictor of actionable concentrations of sulfonamide residues.

A2 In March 1989, the US Court of Appeals ruled in Northeast Women's Center
   vs. McMonagle that the defendant anti-abortion activists could be liable
   under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act for
   alleged acts of intimidation and harassment of the plaintiff abortion
   clinic resulting in destruction of property.  Also during 1989, a US
   District Court in Washington issued a similar ruling, but a US District
   Court in Connecticut held that injunctive relief was not available under
   RICO but granted an injunction under a common law nuisance theory. 
   Other 1989 US court decisions about the activities of anti-abortion
   protestors include 1) that the constitutional rights of clients are not
   infringed upon by loud demonstrations and gratuitous offers of
   counseling as long as the clients are not physically restrained or
   interfered with; 2) that prohibitions on the use of a hand-held
   amplifier are constitutional; 3) that blocking the entrances to abortion
   clinics is not a free speech right but rather violates the right of
   women to interstate travel and is actionable; 4) that abortion-seekers
   do not constitute a class that can invoke special protection under the
   federal civil rights conspiracy statute; and 5) conversely that
   abortion-seekers are the victims of gender-based animus and can invoke
   the protection of the federal civil rights conspiracy statute.

A2 The plaintiffs sought an injunction prohibiting demonstrations by right
   to life groups at a health facility where abortions were performed. 
   Among the claims for relief were two federal claims alleging conspiracy
   to deprive pregnant women of their constitutional right to choose
   abortion.  The U.S. District Court ruled that the conspiracy charge was
   actionable under federal law only upon showing of state action, and that
   a private conspiracy by right to life groups was not actionable.  Having
   dismissed the federal claims, the court decided to retain jurisdiction
   over the case rather than remand it to the state court where it had
   originally been filed for trial.

A2 This document contains major provisions of the 1987 South African
   Proclamation amending the Natal Code of Zulu Law.  Chapter 4 of these
   provisions covers personal status, property rights, the age of majority,
   and houses or families of which children become members.  Chapter 5
   deals with family heads in general, the earnings of minor children, the
   ownership and control of family property, the control of family members,
   and the responsibilities and privileges of family heads.  The seventh
   chapter regulates customary marriages in general, the investigation of
   complaints about unreasonable withholding of consent on the part of a
   father or guardian, reporting of the arranged marriage date and payment
   of fees, the appointment and duties of official witnesses, the payment
   of "lobolo," the registration of customary marriages, issuance of the
   certificate of customary marriage, grounds for divorce, grounds for a
   declaration of nullity, duties of the party seeking the divorce, return
   of lobolo, child custody, and "ukungena" unions.  The provisions of the
   eight chapter include the date of payment and delivery of lobolo and
   death of the lobolo cattle, the women who may receive lobolo, the
   constitution of lobolo, the amount of lobolo paid for women of varying

AB Although healthcare management information systems significantly enhance the decision-making capacity of the chief executive officer (CEO), some CEOs make limited use of this potentially powerful management ally. A central management issue is finding the optimal fit between the CEO's roles and responsibilities and the capacity of information systems to adapt to and support these functions. Thus data system designers must clearly understand the CEO's needs, management tasks, and unique responsibilities. An often misunderstood concept is that data by themselves are not immediately useful and applicable to managerial needs. To become useful information, data must be timely, accurate, relevant, and actionable. CEOs may be disappointed with management information systems because of an inherent conflict between what the computer can do best--rapid, routinized solutions--and what top management usually requires. The CEO's decisions are generally singular, and the system's data may not be structured to serve those decision-making requirements. Building a system that is responsive to the CEO's needs requires an equal partnership between the CEO, data manager, and system designer. The CEO also must be willing to invest a lot of time in shaping the facility's system. In addition, because of the considerable and escalating cost of developing, using, and maintaining organizational data systems, CEOs must assess the cost/benefit ratio of obtaining additional information from existing data bases.

AB Ambivalence is conceived as a condition of an internal contradiction between an emotional verification of self-feeling, and the imaginative action-ability in respect to an existential life performance, if by the a priori of temporality no adequate actionability in terms of imaginations, and no adequate assertion of an unreflected self-feeling as an emotional quality of self-awareness is simultaneously available. Four cases will illustrate that in psychosomatic patients a as if actionability, e.g. as a mere over-adaptation following life-events of significant others, is predominantly given replacing a self-conform action-ability, and that the assertion of self-feeling is preponderantly fixed to the somatic phenomena. Thus the historical life-performance remains arrested by the predominance of unachieved affective moments in the condition of an affective ambivalence, though psychosomatic patients are well aware enough of the existential necessity to arrange temporality as an existential quality of the futural aspects of their life-performance.

A2 The parents of a Down's syndrome baby brought suit against their
   obstetrician and health plan on the grounds that neither had offered the
   mother the option of amniocentesis testing.  The defendants invoked a
   Minnesota statute prohibiting wrongful life and wrongful birth actions. 
   The parents challenged the constitutionality of the statute, arguing
   that it restricted the mother's right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade,
   violated her due process and equal protection rights, and deprived her
   of a remedy for rights vested at common law.  The Supreme Court of
   Minnesota upheld the statute, noting that the real issue was not the
   mother's right to an abortion, but rather the legislature's right to
   decide what conduct by one person is actionable by another.

AB The growing problem of discrimination against physicians seeking hospital staff privileges may be met by various tort and contract actions against hospitals and medical staff members. In many jurisdictions, the obstacles presented by common-law and statutory immunities and the unavailability of judicial review for actions involving private hospitals pose formidable obstacles. However, the current trend in the courts would seem to be toward actionability.

A2 The decision in a British negligence action, Blythe v. Bloomsbury Health
   Authority and Furness, emphasizes the duty of a doctor to provide
   information about risks of medical treatment in answer to a patient's
   direct inquiry.  When the contraceptive Depo-provera was recommended to
   a patient, she requested detailed information on possible side effects. 
   She was not fully informed before consenting to the treatment, and later
   suffered excessive bleeding for several months.  Finding for the
   plaintiff, the court held that failure to respond to a patient's
   questions is actionable in English law because it is "a breach of the
   doctor's duty of care."

AB Forensic complications involving criminal or civil law are generally rare in depressive disorders, but are of varied nature and of great consequence to the person concerned. Suicide, which is the problem of greatest practical importance may have far-reaching consequences with regard to legal insurance, apart from the medical responsibility or liability. From the point of view of civil law, moreover, the effects of depression on thought and action, as well as on free will with respect to legal capacity, testifiability, marriageability, actionability and potential considerations of interdiction ought to be examined. Last, but not least, consequences of a socio-legal nature may ensue. The spectrum of possible crimes by depressed subjects essentially comprises disease-characteristic offences, amongst which the desperate deed of extended suicide is foremost, as well as other criminal acts with a less direct connection to the depressive syndrome. Additional factors such as alcohol and medication may further complicate the relationship and also the assessment of culpability. In the forensic judgment of depressed subjects diagnostic classification is not alone decisive, but depends to a greater extent on the nature and severity of the psychopathological state and its influence on motivational aspects.

AB The author reports on current German court rulings on whether non-medically indicated abortions (although not prohibited by law and therefore not actionable) should be financed via the compulsory health insurance scheme or by the Federal Government. 1. The social welfare court at Dortmund ruled that current legislation governing the financing of welfare expenditure violates the Federal German constitution, and has, therefore, referred this matter to the Federal Constitutional Court. However, the Federal Constitutional Court turned down the referral and dismissed the case, since an application for declaring a Federal law null and void can be filed by the Federal Government or by a Federal Land Government or by at least one-third of the total number of members of the Federal German Parliament (Bundestag) only. This means that the current proceedings at the Dortmund social welfare court must continue. The plaintiff pleads to prohibit the compulsory health insurance scheme authorities from defraying the expenses for performing foeticide via legally permitted abortion without medical indication. 2. The Federal Land Government of Baden-Wurttemberg is the only Land Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that does not grant any financial aid towards performing non-medically indicated (albeit not legally actionable) abortions. Hence, the Baden-Wurttemberg Administrative Courts turned down the plea filed by a woman government servant towards paying such aid. The court decision was based on the judge's opinion that even the principle of equality before the law guaranteed by the Constitution would not compel the Land Government to emulate the example of the other Land Governments who are agreeable to bearing abortion costs.

AB Aldicarb, a carbamate pesticide, was detected for the first time in groundwater in Suffolk County, New York, in August 1979. Although all laboratory and field studies indicated that the pesticide could not reach groundwater, a combination of circumstances allowed its residues not only to reach groundwater but also to be ingested by humans. Inquiries in hospitals and poison control centers did not reveal any cases of carbamate poisoning. The extensive monitoring program, conducted by the County in cooperation with the federal and state agencies and the Union Carbide Corporation, showed that 1,121 (13.5 per cent) of the 8,404 wells examined exceeded the state recommended guidelines of 7 ppb. Of the contaminated wells 52 per cent contained adicarb between 8 and 30 ppb, 32 per cent between 31 and 75 ppb, and 16 per cent more that 75 ppb. Residents whose wells exceeded the guideline were advised not to use the water for drinking or cooking purposes and to obtain an alternate source of potable water. The Union Carbide Corporation provided those residents with activated carbon filtration units. The incident raises several serious issues, such as the testing of pesticides under field conditions prior to registration and during their use, the validity of the recommended actionable levels, and the paucity of long-term epidemiologic studies of the health effects resulting from consumption of pesticides in trace concentrations.

AB Though little overt, "actionable" discrimination is apparent in medical schools, a "discriminatory environment" persists, in part because its structure is based on an understanding of "commitment" and "success" congruent with male--but not female--sex role stereotypes and familial roles. Professional commitment--one of the profession's most important criteria for judging a recruit's suitability and potential for success--is used to illustrate how women's choice of careers are channelled and constrained within medicine. Illustrative data are drawn from semi-structured interviews with administrators, faculty, and students in a nationwide sample of medical schools.
