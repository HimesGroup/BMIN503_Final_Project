AB Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with both RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors determined by non-next generation sequencing (NGS) testing may still not respond due to the presence of additional mutated genes such as PIK3CA or PTEN. In this study, a broad, hybrid capture-based NGS assay was used to identify RAS, BRAF and additional targetable genetic alterations from Chinese CRC tissues.; Methods: Fifty-seven cases of CRC were enrolled, and all the patients signed the informed consent. In total, 7708 exons of 508 tumor-related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, INDELs, copy number alterations, and gene fusions.; Results: The study found that 50.9% (29/57) of the tumors harbored KRAS mutations, 3.5% (2/57) harbored NRAS mutations and 3.5% (2/57) harbored BRAF mutations. More specifically, 89.7% (26/29) of RAS mutations were located in codon 12. Except for RAS and RAF, anti-EGFR therapy response genetic mutations in PTEN (n=2) and PIK3CA (n=1) were found in 4.7% (3/64) of the samples. Actionable alterations were found in HER2 (n = 7), CCND2 (n = 2), NF1 (n = 1), and BRCA1 (n = 1).; Conclusions: Our results illustrated that 82.5% (47/57) of the samples harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration identified by NGS. HER2 amplifications or mutations, which were identified in 12.3% of the tissues, defined a unique molecular subtype of CRC. The study suggests that high-throughput NGS testing in CRC tissues is a comprehensive and efficient genomic profiling assay to guide personalized therapy.

AB Background: NRG1 fusion-positive lung cancers have emerged as potentially actionable events in lung cancer, but clinical support is currently limited and no evidence of efficacy of this approach in cancers beyond lung has been shown.; Patients and methods: Here, we describe two patients with advanced cancers refractory to standard therapies. Patient 1 had lung adenocarcinoma and patient 2 cholangiocarcinoma. Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing were carried out for these cases with select findings validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization.; Results: Both tumors were found to be positive for NRG1 gene fusions. In patient 1, an SDC4-NRG1 gene fusion was detected, similar gene fusions having been described in lung cancers previously. In patient 2, a novel ATP1B1-NRG1 gene fusion was detected. Cholangiocarcinoma is not a disease type in which NRG1 fusions had been described previously. Integrative genome analysis was used to assess the potential functional significance of the detected genomic events including the gene fusions, prioritizing therapeutic strategies targeting the HER-family of growth factor receptors. Both patients were treated with the pan HER-family kinase inhibitor afatinib and both displayed significant and durable response to treatment. Upon progression sites of disease were sequenced. The lack of obvious genomic events to describe the disease progression indicated that broad transcriptomic or epigenetic mechanisms could be attributed to the lack of prolonged response to afatinib.; Conclusion: These observations lend further support to the use of pan HER-tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of NRG1 fusion-positive in both cancers of lung and hepatocellular origin and indicate more broadly that cancers found to be NRG1 fusion-positive may benefit from such a clinical approach regardless of their site of origin.; Clinical trial information: Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) Program of British Columbia: Utilization of Genomic Analysis to Better Understand Tumour Heterogeneity and Evolution (NCT02155621). © The Author 2017.

AB PURPOSE: When codeine and tramadol are used for pain management, it is imperative that nurses are able to assess for potential drug-gene and drug-drug-gene interactions that could adversely impact drug metabolism and ultimately pain relief. Both drugs are metabolized through the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway which can be affected by medications as well the patient's own pharmacogenotype. The purpose of this brief report is to identify drug-gene and drug-drug-gene interactions in 30 adult patients prescribed codeine or tramadol for pain.; METHODS: We used three data sources: (1) six months of electronic health record data on the number and types of medications prescribed to each patient; (2) each patient's CYP2D6 pharmacogenotype, and (3) published data on known CYP2D6 gene-drug and drug-drug-gene interactions.; RESULTS: Ten patients (33%) had possible drug-gene or drug-drug-gene interactions. Five patients had CYP2D6 drug-gene interactions indicating they were not good candidates for codeine or tramadol. In addition, five patients had potential CYP2D6 drug-drug-gene interactions with either codeine or tramadol.; CONCLUSION: Our findings from this exploratory study underscores the importance of assessing and accounting for drug-gene and drug-drug-gene interactions in patients prescribed codeine or tramadol.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pharmacogenomic testing has the potential to greatly benefit patients by enabling personalization of medication management, ensuring better efficacy and decreasing the risk of side effects. However, to fully realize the potential of pharmacogenomic testing, there are several important issues that must be addressed. Areas covered: In this expert review we discuss current challenges impacting the implementation of pharmacogenomic testing in the clinical practice. We emphasize issues related to testing methods, reporting of the results, test selection, clinical interpretation of the results, cost-effectiveness, and the long-term use of pharmacogenomic results in clinical practice. We identify opportunities and future directions to facilitate clinical implementation. Expert commentary: Several key elements are necessary to optimally integrate pharmacogenomic testing into clinical practice. Collaborative efforts among laboratories are needed to improve standardization of testing and reporting of the results. Clinicians need educational opportunities to improve understanding of which test to order and how to interpret the results. The electronic health records and other clinical systems need to improve their storage of the pharmacogenomics test results and interoperability to facilitate the use of clinically actionable results to improve patient care.

AB BACKGROUND: The 2014-2016 Ebola crisis in West Africa had approximately eight times as many reported deaths as the sum of all previous Ebola outbreaks. The outbreak magnitude and occurrence of multiple Ebola cases in at least seven countries beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, hinted at the possibility of broad-scale transmission of Ebola.; MAIN TEXT: Using a modeling tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Ebola outbreak, we estimated the number of Ebola cases that might have occurred had the disease spread beyond the three countries in West Africa to cities in other countries at high risk for disease transmission (based on late 2014 air travel patterns). We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola.; CONCLUSIONS: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak.

AB OBJECTIVE: To outline new design directions for informatics solutions that facilitate personal discovery with self-monitoring data. We investigate this question in the context of chronic disease self-management with the focus on type 2 diabetes.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational qualitative study of discovery with personal data among adults attending a diabetes self-management education (DSME) program that utilized a discovery-based curriculum. The study included observations of class sessions, and interviews and focus groups with the educator and attendees of the program (n = 14).; RESULTS: The main discovery in diabetes self-management evolved around discovering patterns of association between characteristics of individuals' activities and changes in their blood glucose levels that the participants referred to as "cause and effect". This discovery empowered individuals to actively engage in self-management and provided a desired flexibility in selection of personalized self-management strategies. We show that discovery of cause and effect involves four essential phases: (1) feature selection, (2) hypothesis generation, (3) feature evaluation, and (4) goal specification. Further, we identify opportunities to support discovery at each stage with informatics and data visualization solutions by providing assistance with: (1) active manipulation of collected data (e.g., grouping, filtering and side-by-side inspection), (2) hypotheses formulation (e.g., using natural language statements or constructing visual queries), (3) inference evaluation (e.g., through aggregation and visual comparison, and statistical analysis of associations), and (4) translation of discoveries into actionable goals (e.g., tailored selection from computable knowledge sources of effective diabetes self-management behaviors).; DISCUSSION: The study suggests that discovery of cause and effect in diabetes can be a powerful approach to helping individuals to improve their self-management strategies, and that self-monitoring data can serve as a driving engine for personal discovery that may lead to sustainable behavior changes.; CONCLUSIONS: Enabling personal discovery is a promising new approach to enhancing chronic disease self-management with informatics interventions.

AB As clinicians, educators, and researchers, our ability to provide the best possible care to our patients who are sexual and gender minority (SGM) people of color is increasingly challenged. Relative to the general population, SGM patients often have worse health outcomes, and among SGM patients, racial and ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable. Healthcare policies proposed by the current administration, along with an increasingly hostile and dangerous social climate, have the potential to seriously harm SGM patients of color. In this paper, we discuss these key policy issues impacting the health of SGM patients of color. We then suggest questions for clinicians to consider to help them decide which advocacy activities are right for them, recommending self-examination, skills development, and political action. We end by outlining concrete, actionable steps to advocate for SGM patients of color in patient care, healthcare organizations, medical education, research, and public policy.

AB Precision medicine trials and targeted therapies have shifted to the forefront of oncology. Although targeted therapies have shown initial promise, implementation across the broad landscape of oncology has many challenges. These limitations include an incomplete understanding of the functional significance of variant alleles as well as the need for clinical research and practice models that are more patient-centered and account for the complexity of individual patient tumors. Furthermore, successful implementation of targeted therapies will also be predicated on efforts to standardize the framework for patient management support. Here, we review current implementations of targeted therapies in precision oncology and discuss how "actionability" is defined for molecular targets in cancer therapeutics. We also comment on the growing need for bioinformatics tools and data platforms to complement advances in precision oncology. Finally, we discuss current frameworks for integrating precision oncology into patient management and propose an integrated model that combines features of molecular tumor boards and decision support systems.

AB Targeted drugs are effective when they directly inhibit strong disease drivers, but only a small fraction of diseases feature defined actionable drivers. Alternatively, network-based approaches can uncover new therapeutic opportunities. Applying an integrated phenotypic screening, chemical and phosphoproteomics strategy, here we describe the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor ceritinib as having activity across several ALK-negative lung cancer cell lines and identify new targets and network-wide signaling effects. Combining pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference revealed a polypharmacology mechanism involving the noncanonical targets IGF1R, FAK1, RSK1 and RSK2. Mutating the downstream signaling hub YB1 protected cells from ceritinib. Consistent with YB1 signaling being known to cause taxol resistance, combination of ceritinib with paclitaxel displayed strong synergy, particularly in cells expressing high FAK autophosphorylation, which we show to be prevalent in lung cancer. Together, we present a systems chemical biology platform for elucidating multikinase inhibitor polypharmacology mechanisms, subsequent design of synergistic drug combinations, and identification of mechanistic biomarker candidates.

AB People of East Asian ethnicity have a different prevalence of and show unique clinical characteristics and tumor histology of oncogenic mutations. However, only limited studies have explored the landscape of genomic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma derived from Asian patients thus far. In this single-center study, with an aim to elucidate the mutational profile of lung cancer in people of Chinese ethnicity and to use the obtained information to guide decision-making for treatment, we employed a well-validated assay to perform comprehensive genomic characterization of tumor specimens from 306 Chinese lung cancer patients. A total of 845 individual genomic alterations were found in 145 tumor-related genes with a median of 2.8 alterations (range: 1-18) per sample. The most frequently mutated genes were EGFR (46.7%), TP53 (21.2%), ALK (12.1%; 8.8% of mutation and 3.3% of rearrangement) and KRAS (10.1%). Upon comparison with the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, we found that EGFR was mutated at a much higher frequency in our cohort than in Caucasians, whereas KRAS was only found in 10.1% of our Chinese patients. Clinically relevant genomic alterations were identified in 185 (60.5%) patients, including 50% in adenocarcinoma patients and 14% in squamous cell carcinoma patients. Our findings suggest that the Asian ethnicity is significantly different from the Caucasian ethnicity with regard to the presence of somatic driver mutations. Furthermore, we showed that the use of a comprehensive genotyping approach could help identify actionable genomic alterations that have potential impact on therapeutic decisions. © 2017 The Authors.

AB Our objective was to describe the yield of actionable thoracic spine lesions for a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol including evaluation of the thoracic spine among patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms consistent with epidural compression syndrome. Our ED and Department of Radiology together designed a novel rapid MRI protocol entailing 3D volumetric T2 weighted sequences through both the thoracic and lumbar spine obtained in the sagittal plane to assess for both lumbar and thoracic spine lesions. We recorded study outcomes for all patients undergoing this protocol or conventional lumbar MRI during May 2014-May 2015 to determine the prevalence of actionable thoracic spine lesions. We defined an actionable thoracic lesion as any pathology requiring treatment (e.g., medication, admission, surgery) not otherwise indicated on the basis of lumbar spine findings. During the study period, 112 of 124 (90.3%) of ED patients undergoing MRI evaluation for epidural compression syndrome underwent the novel protocol. The remaining patients underwent evaluation of the lumbar spine using only a conventional MRI protocol. Of the 112 patients undergoing the novel protocol, 6 (5.4%) patients had thoracic spine lesions indicating therapy not otherwise indicated by lumbar spine findings. The etiologies of these six lesions were: neoplasms (2), de-myelination (2), compression fracture (1), and degeneration due to pernicious anemia (1). Emergency providers should strongly consider the routine use of MRI protocols including thoracic spine evaluation in patients presenting to the ED with symptoms consistent with epidural compression syndrome.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study adapted an existing computer-delivered brief alcohol intervention (cBAI) for use in Veterans with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and examined its acceptability and feasibility in this patient population.; METHODS: A four-stage model consisting of initial pilot testing, qualitative interviews with key stakeholders, development of a beta version of the cBAI, and usability testing was used to achieve the study objectives.; RESULTS: In-depth interviews gathered feedback for modifying the cBAI, including adding HCV-related content such as the health effects of alcohol on liver functioning, immune system functioning, and management of HCV, a preference for concepts to be displayed through "newer looking" graphics, and limiting the use of text to convey key concepts. Results from usability testing indicated that the modified cBAI was acceptable and feasible for use in this patient population.; CONCLUSIONS: The development model used in this study is effective for gathering actionable feedback that can inform the development of a cBAI and can result in the development of an acceptable and feasible intervention for use in this population. Findings also have implications for developing computer-delivered interventions targeting behavior change more broadly.

AB The therapeutic use of genomic sequencing creates novel and unresolved questions about cost, clinical efficacy, access, and the disclosure of sequencing results. The disclosure of the secondary results of sequencing poses a particularly challenging ethical problem. Experts disagree about which results should be shared and public input - especially important for the creation of disclosure policies - is complicated by the complex nature of genetics. Recognizing the value of deliberative democratic methods for soliciting informed public opinion on matters like these, we recruited participants from a clinical research site for an all-day deliberative democracy (DD) session. Participants were introduced to the clinical and ethical issues associated with genomic sequencing, after which they discussed the tradeoffs and offered their opinions about policies for the return of secondary results. Participants (n=66; mean age=57 (SD=15); 70% female; 76% white) were divided into 10 small groups (5 to 8 participants each) allowing interactive deliberation on policy options for the return of three categories of secondary results: 1) medically actionable results; 2) risks for adult-onset disorders identified in children; and 3) carrier status for autosomal recessive disorders. In our qualitative analysis of the session transcripts, we found that while participants favored choice and had a preference for making information available, they also acknowledged the risks (and benefits) of learning such information. Our research reveals the nuanced reasoning used by members of the public when weighing the pros and cons of receiving genomic information, enriching our understanding of the findings of surveys of attitudes regarding access to secondary results.

AB A plethora of tests are routinely ordered and interpreted by pathologists to assist the management of colorectal cancer patients. Many of these tests are immunohistochemistry assays using antibodies against prognostically relevant proteins, some of which predict therapeutic response. This review focuses on tissue DNA-based tests. It presents novel methodologies for assessing well-established biomarkers, updates the expanding spectrum of genetic alterations that are associated with resistance to inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, and briefly discusses emerging actionable alterations that may translate into new therapeutic options for colorectal cancer patients. The utility of next-generation sequencing is emphasized. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A recently published book by the head of Nelson Mandela's medical team made personal disclosures about his treatment of the late president in his final years up until his death. The author claimed that he had written the book at the request of family members. This was contested by some family members and the executors of Mandela's estate, and the book was subsequently withdrawn by the publishers. The Mandela book case raises ethical and legal questions about who should consent to publication of medical information about public figures after their death. The ethical rules of conduct of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) state that confidential information about a deceased person should only be divulged 'with the written consent of his or her next of kin or the executor of his or her estate'. 'Next of kin' is not defined, however, and problems arise when family members and the executors are divided about giving such written consent. It is recommended that in such cases the specific order of priority for consent by relatives in the National Health Act be followed. However, conduct that is unethical under the rules of the HPCSA may not necessarily be actionable under the law. For instance, the law does not protect the confidentiality of deceased persons, and generally when people die their constitutional and common-law personality rights - including their right to privacy and confidentiality - die with them. This means that the next of kin or executors of the estates of deceased persons may not bring actions for damages on behalf of such persons for breaches of confidentiality arising after their deaths. The next of kin may, however, sue in their personal capacity if they can show that the disclosures were an unlawful invasion of their own privacy. Conversely, if the privacy of interests of the next of kin are not harmed where there has been publication without their consent, they will not be able to sue for damages.

AB Personalized cancer medicine based on the analysis of tumors en masse is limited by tumor heterogeneity, which has become a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are emerging as key drivers of inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. CSC have unique metabolic dependencies that are required not only for specific bioenergetic/biosynthetic demands but also for sustaining their operational epigenetic traits, i.e. self-renewal, tumor-initiation, and plasticity. Given that the metabolome is the final downstream product of all the -omic layers and, therefore, most representative of the biological phenotype, we here propose that a novel approach to better understand the complexity of tumor heterogeneity is by mapping and cataloging small numbers of CSC metabolomic phenotypes. The narrower metabolomic diversity of CSC states could be employed to reduce multidimensional tumor heterogeneity into dynamic models of fewer actionable sub-phenotypes. The identification of the driver nodes that are used differentially by CSC states to metabolically regulate self-renewal and tumor initation and escape chemotherapy might open new preventive and therapeutic avenues. The mapping of CSC metabolomic states could become a pioneering strategy to reduce the dimensionality of tumor heterogeneity and improve our ability to examine changes in tumor cell populations for cancer detection, prognosis, prediction/monitoring of therapy response, and detection of therapy resistance and recurrent disease. The identification of driver metabolites and metabolic nodes accounting for a large amount of variance within the CSC metabolomic sub-phenotypes might offer new unforeseen opportunities for reducing and exploiting tumor heterogeneity via metabolic targeting of CSC.

AB BACKGROUND: The National Quality Forum has endorsed quality-improvement measures for multiple cancer types that are being developed into actionable tools to improve cancer care. No nationally endorsed quality metrics currently exist for head and neck cancer.; METHODS: The authors identified patients with surgically treated, invasive, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2014 and compared the rate of adherence to 5 different quality metrics and whether compliance with these quality metrics impacted overall survival. The metrics examined included negative surgical margins, neck dissection lymph node (LN) yield≥18, appropriate adjuvant radiation, appropriate adjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant therapy within 6 weeks, as well as overall quality.; RESULTS: In total, 76,853 eligible patients were identified. There was substantial variability in patient-level adherence, which was 80% for negative surgical margins, 73.1% for neck dissection LN yield, 69% for adjuvant radiation, 42.6% for adjuvant chemoradiation, and 44.5% for adjuvant therapy within 6 weeks. Risk-adjusted Cox proportional-hazard models indicated that all metrics were associated with a reduced risk of death: negative margins (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.76), LN yield≥18 (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.96), adjuvant radiation (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.64-0.70), adjuvant chemoradiation (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.88), and adjuvant therapy ≤6 weeks (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.96). Patients who received high-quality care had a 19% reduced adjusted hazard of mortality (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.83).; CONCLUSIONS: Five head and neck cancer quality metrics were identified that have substantial variability in adherence and meaningfully impact overall survival. These metrics are appropriate candidates for national adoption. Cancer 2017;123:4372-81. © 2017 American Cancer Society. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

AB Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a difficult to treat subtype of lung cancer. One of the hallmarks of SCLC is its almost uniform chemotherapy sensitivity. However, chemotherapy response is typically transient and patients frequently succumb to SCLC within a year following diagnosis. We performed a transcriptome analysis of the major human lung cancer entities. We show a significant overexpression of genes involved in the DNA damage response, specifically in SCLC. Particularly CHEK1, which encodes for the cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK1, is significantly overexpressed in SCLC, compared to lung adenocarcinoma. In line with uncontrolled cell cycle progression in SCLC, we find that CDC25A, B and C mRNAs are expressed at significantly higher levels in SCLC, compared to lungadenocarcinoma. We next profiled the efficacy of compounds targeting CHK1 and ATR. Both, ATR- and CHK1 inhibitors induce genotoxic damage and apoptosis in human and murine SCLC cell lines, but not in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We further demonstrate that murine SCLC tumors were highly sensitive to ATR- and CHK1 inhibitors, while Kras G12D -driven murine lungadenocarcinomas were resistant against these compounds and displayed continued growth under therapy. Altogether, our data indicate that SCLC displays an actionable dependence on ATR/CHK1-mediated cell cycle checkpoints.

AB OBJECTIVES: The period following discharge from the hospital is one of heightened vulnerability. Discharge instructions serve as a guide during this transition. Yet, clinicians receive little feedback on the quality of this document that ties into the patients' experience. We reviewed the issues voiced by discharged patients via a call-back program and compared them to the discharge instructions they had received.; METHODS: At our institution, patients receive an automated call forty-eight hours following discharge inquiring about progress. If indicated by the response to the call, they are directed to a nurse who assists with problem solving. We reviewed the nursing documentation of these encounters for a period of nine months. The issues voiced were grouped into five categories: communication, medications, durable medical equipment/therapies, follow up and new or ongoing symptoms. The discharge instructions given to each patient were reviewed. We retrieved data on the number of discharges from each specialty from the hospital over the same period.; RESULTS: A total of 592 patients voiced 685 issues. The numbers of patients discharged from medical or surgical services identified as having issues via the call-back line paralleled the proportions discharged from medical and surgical services from the hospital during the same period. Nearly a quarter of the issues discussed had been addressed in the discharge instructions. The most common category of issues was related to communication deficits including missing or incomplete information which made it difficult for the patient to enact or understand the plan of care. Medication prescription related issues were the next most common. Resource barriers and questions surrounding medications were often unaddressed.; CONCLUSIONS: Post discharge issues affect patients discharged from all services equally. Data from call back programs may provide actionable targets for improvement, identify the inpatient team's 'blind spots' and be used to provide feedback to clinicians.

AB Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are commonly involved in drug metabolism, and genetic variation in the genes encoding CYPs are associated with variable drug response. While genotype-guided therapy has been clinically implemented in adults, these associations are less well established for pediatric patients. In order to understand the frequency of pediatric exposures to drugs with known CYP interactions, we compiled all actionable drug-CYP interactions with a high level of evidence using Clinical Pharmacogenomic Implementation Consortium (CPIC) data and surveyed 10 years of electronic health records (EHR) data for the number of children exposed to CYP-associated drugs. Subsequently, we performed a focused literature review for drugs commonly used in pediatrics, defined as more than 5000 pediatric patients exposed in the decade-long EHR cohort. There were 48 drug-CYP interactions with a high level of evidence in the CPIC database. Of those, only 10 drugs were commonly used in children (ondansetron, oxycodone, codeine, omeprazole, lansoprazole, sertraline, amitriptyline, citalopram, escitalopram, and risperidone). For these drugs, reports of the drug-CYP interaction in cohorts including children were sparse. There are adequate data for implementation of genotype-guided therapy for children for three of the 10 commonly used drugs (codeine, omeprazole and lansoprazole). For the majority of commonly used drugs with known CYP interactions, more data are required to support pharmacogenomic implementation in children.

AB Driver somatic mutations are a hallmark of a tumor that can be used for diagnosis and targeted therapy. Mutations are primarily detected from tumor DNA. As dynamic molecules of gene activities, transcriptome profiling by RNA sequence (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular, which not only measures gene expression but also structural variations such as mutations and fusion transcripts. Although single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) can be easily identified from RNA-seq, intermediate long insertions/deletions (indels >2 bases and less than sequence reads) cause significant challenges and are ignored by most RNA-seq analysis tools. This study evaluates commonly used RNA-seq analysis programs along with variant and somatic mutation callers in a series of data sets with simulated and known indels. The aim is to develop strategies for accurate indel detection. Our results show that the RNA-seq alignment is the most important step for indel identification and the evaluated programs have a wide range of sensitivity to map sequence reads with indels, from not at all to decently sensitive. The sensitivity is impacted by sequence read lengths. Most variant calling programs rely on hard evidence indels marked in the alignment and the programs with realignment may use soft-clipped reads for indel inferencing. Based on the observations, we have provided practical recommendations for indel detection when different RNA-seq aligners are used and demonstrated the best option with highly reliable results. With careful customization of bioinformatics algorithms, RNA-seq can be reliably used for both SNV and indel mutation detection that can be used for clinical decision-making. © The Author 2016.

AB Despite intense efforts, the cure rates of childhood and adult solid tumors are not satisfactory. Resistance to intensive chemotherapy is common, and targets for molecular therapies are largely undefined. We have found that the majority of childhood solid tumors, including rhabdoid tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma, express an active DNA transposase, PGBD5, that can promote site-specific genomic rearrangements in human cells. Using functional genetic approaches, we discovered that mouse and human cells deficient in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair cannot tolerate the expression of PGBD5. In a chemical screen of DNA damage signaling inhibitors, we identified AZD6738 as a specific sensitizer of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage and apoptosis. We found that expression of PGBD5, but not its nuclease activity-deficient mutant, was sufficient to induce sensitivity to AZD6738. Depletion of endogenous PGBD5 conferred resistance to AZD6738 in human tumor cells. PGBD5-expressing tumor cells accumulated unrepaired DNA damage in response to AZD6738 treatment and underwent apoptosis in both dividing and G1-phase cells in the absence of immediate DNA replication stress. Accordingly, AZD6738 exhibited nanomolar potency against most neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdoid tumor cells tested while sparing nontransformed human and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. Finally, treatment with AZD6738 induced apoptosis and regression of human neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma tumors engrafted in immunodeficient mice in vivo. This effect was potentiated by combined treatment with cisplatin, including substantial antitumor activity against patient-derived primary neuroblastoma xenografts. These findings delineate a therapeutically actionable synthetic dependency induced in PGBD5-expressing solid tumors.

AB Long lead-time space-weather forecasting requires accurate prediction of the near-Earth solar wind. The current state of the art uses a coronal model to extrapolate the observed photospheric magnetic field to the upper corona, where it is related to solar wind speed through empirical relations. These near-Sun solar wind and magnetic field conditions provide the inner boundary condition to three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere out to 1AU. This physics-based approach can capture dynamic processes within the solar wind, which affect the resulting conditions in near-Earth space. However, this deterministic approach lacks a quantification of forecast uncertainty. Here we describe a complementary method to exploit the near-Sun solar wind information produced by coronal models and provide a quantitative estimate of forecast uncertainty. By sampling the near-Sun solar wind speed at a range of latitudes about the sub-Earth point, we produce a large ensemble (N=576) of time series at the base of the Sun-Earth line. Propagating these conditions to Earth by a three-dimensional MHD model would be computationally prohibitive; thus, a computationally efficient one-dimensional "upwind" scheme is used. The variance in the resulting near-Earth solar wind speed ensemble is shown to provide an accurate measure of the forecast uncertainty. Applying this technique over 1996-2016, the upwind ensemble is found to provide a more "actionable" forecast than a single deterministic forecast; potential economic value is increased for all operational scenarios, but particularly when false alarms are important (i.e., where the cost of taking mitigating action is relatively large).

AB Background: Information technology, including clinical decision support systems (CDSS), have an increasingly important and growing role in identifying opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship-related interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe and compare types and outcomes of CDSS-built antimicrobial stewardship alerts. Methods: Fifteen alerts were evaluated in the initial antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) review. Preimplementation, alerts were reviewed retrospectively. Postimplementation, alerts were reviewed in real-time. Data collection included total number of actionable alerts, recommendation acceptance rates, and time spent on each alert. Time to de-escalation to narrower spectrum agents was collected. Results: In total, 749 alerts were evaluated. Overall, 306 (41%) alerts were actionable (173 preimplementation, 133 postimplementation). Rates of actionable alerts were similar for custom-built and prebuilt alert types (39% [53 of 135] vs 41% [253 of 614], P = .68]. In the postimplementation group, an intervention was attempted in 97% of actionable alerts and 70% of interventions were accepted. The median time spent per alert was 7 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 5-13 minutes; 15 [12-17] minutes for actionable alerts vs 6 [5-7] minutes for nonactionable alerts, P < .001). In cases where the antimicrobial was eventually de-escalated, the median time to de-escalation was 28.8 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0-69.1 hours) preimplementation vs 4.7 hours (95% CI, 2.4-22.1 hours) postimplementation, P < .001. Conclusions: CDSS have played an important role in ASPs to help identify opportunities to optimize antimicrobial use through prebuilt and custom-built alerts. As ASP roles continue to expand, focusing time on customizing institution specific alerts will be of vital importance to help redistribute time needed to manage other ASP tasks and opportunities.

AB The Movember Foundation raises awareness and funds for men's health issues such as prostate and testicular cancers in conjunction with a moustache contest. The 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom shared the same goal of creating conversations about men's health that lead to increased awareness and understanding of the health risks men face. Our objective was to explore Twitter conversations to identify whether the 2013 Movember campaigns sparked global conversations about prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and other men's health issues. We conducted a content analysis of 12,666 tweets posted during the 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom (4,222 tweets from each country) to investigate whether tweets were health-related or non-health-related and to determine what topics dominated conversations. Few tweets ( n = 84, 0.7% of 12,666 tweets) provided content-rich or actionable health information that would lead to awareness and understanding of men's health risks. While moustache growing and grooming was the most popular topic in U.S. tweets, conversations about community engagement were most common in Canadian and U.K. tweets. Significantly more tweets co-opted the Movember campaign to market products or contests in the United States than Canada and the United Kingdom ( p < .05). Findings from this content analysis of Twitter suggest that the 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom sparked few conversations about prostate and testicular cancers that could potentially lead to greater awareness and understanding of important men's health issues.

AB INTRODUCTION: Readmissions have become a focus of pay-for-performance programs. Surgical site infections (SSI) are the reason for most readmissions. Readmissions for SSI could be a unique target for quality improvement.; METHODS: Readmission risk for SSI were evaluated for patients undergoing colectomies from 2013 to 2014. Hazard models were developed to examine factors associated with and hospital-level variation in risk-adjusted rates of readmission for SSI.; RESULTS: Among 59,088 patients at 525 hospitals, the rate of readmissions for SSI ranged from 1.45% to 6.34%. Characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of SSI readmissions include male gender, smoking, open surgery and hospitals with increased socioeconomically-disadvantaged patients. After risk adjustment, there was little correlation between hospital performance with SSI readmission rate and performance with overall SSI or total readmission rate (r2=0.29, r2=0.14).; CONCLUSIONS: Readmission for SSI represents a unique aspect of quality beyond that offered by measuring only SSI or readmission rates alone, and may provide actionable quality improvement.

AB FGFR2 is recurrently amplified in 5% of gastric cancers and 1%-4% of breast cancers; however, this molecular alteration has never been reported in a primary colorectal cancer specimen. Preclinical studies indicate that several FGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as AZD4547, have in vitro activity against the FGFR2-amplified colorectal cell line, NCI-H716. The efficacy of these inhibitors is currently under investigation in clinical trials for breast and gastric cancer. Thus, better characterizing colorectal tumors for FGFR2 amplification could identify a subset of patients who may benefit from FGFR TKI therapies. Here, we describe a novel FGFR2 amplification identified by clinical next-generation sequencing in a primary colorectal cancer. Further characterization of the tumor by immunohistochemistry showed neuroendocrine differentiation, similar to the reported properties of the NCI-H716 cell line. These findings demonstrate that the spectrum of potentially clinically actionable mutations detected by targeted clinical sequencing panels is not limited to only single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions but also to copy-number alterations. © 2017 Carter et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Importance: Small-bowel adenocarcinomas (SBAs) are rare cancers with a significantly lower incidence, later stage at diagnosis, and worse overall survival than other intestinal-derived cancers. To date, comprehensive genomic analysis of SBA is lacking.; Objective: To perform in-depth genomic characterization of a large series of SBAs and other gastrointestinal tumors to draw comparisons and identify potentially clinically actionable alterations.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective analysis was performed of clinical samples from patients with SBA (n=317), colorectal cancer (n=6353), and gastric carcinoma (n=889) collected between August 24, 2012, and February 3, 2016, using hybrid-capture-based genomic profiling, at the request of the individual treating physicians in the course of clinical care for the purpose of making therapy decisions.; Results: Of the 7559 patients included in analysis, 4138 (54.7%) were male; the median age was 56 (range, 12-101) years. The frequency of genomic alterations seen in SBA demonstrated distinct differences in comparison with either colorectal cancer (APC: 26.8% [85 of 317] vs 75.9% [4823 of 6353], P<.001; and CDKN2A: 14.5% [46 of 317] vs 2.6% [165 of 6353], P<.001) or gastric carcinoma (KRAS: 53.6% [170 of 317] vs 14.2% [126 of 889], P<.001; APC: 26.8% [85 of 317] vs 7.8% [69 of 889], P<.001; and SMAD4: 17.4% [55 of 317] vs 5.2% [46 of 889], P<.001). BRAF was mutated in 7.6% (484 of 6353) of colorectal cancer and 9.1% (29 of 317) of SBA samples, but V600E mutations were much less common in SBA, representing only 10.3% (3 of 29) of BRAF-mutated cases. The ERBB2/HER2 point mutations (8.2% [26 of 317]), microsatellite instability (7.6% [13 of 170]), and high tumor mutational burden (9.5% [30 of 317]) were all enriched in SBA. Significant differences were noted in the molecular profile of unspecified SBA compared with duodenal adenocarcinoma, as well as in inflammatory bowel disease-associated SBAs. Targetable alterations in several additional genes, including PIK3CA and MEK1, and receptor tyrosine kinase fusions, were also identified in all 3 series.; Conclusions and Relevance: This study presents to our knowledge the first large-scale genomic comparison of SBA with colorectal cancer and gastric carcinoma. The distinct genomic differences establish SBA as a molecularly unique intestinal cancer. In addition, genomic profiling can identify potentially targetable genomic alterations in the majority of SBA cases (91%), and the higher incidence of microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden in SBA suggests a potential role for immunotherapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Residents frequently report inadequate feedback both in quantity and quality. The study evaluates the quality of faculty feedback about operative performance given using an app-based system.; DESIGN: Residents requested operative performance evaluation from faculty on a real-time basis using the "Zwisch Me!!" mobile application which allows faculty to provide brief written feedback. Qualitative analysis of feedback was performed using grounded theory.; SETTING: The 7 academic medical centers with thoracic surgery training programs.; PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer thoracic surgery residents in both integrated and traditional training pathways and their affiliated cardiothoracic faculty.; RESULTS: Residents (n = 33) at 7 institutions submitted a total of 596 evaluations to faculty (n = 48). Faculty acknowledged the evaluation request in 476 cases (80%) and in 350 cases (74%) provided written feedback. Initial open coding generated 12 categories of feedback type. We identified 3 overarching themes. The first theme was the tone of the feedback. Encouraging elements were identified in 162 comments (46%) and corrective elements in 230 (65%). The second theme was the topic of the feedback. Surgical technique was the most common category at 148 comments (42.2%) followed by preparation for case (n = 69, 19.7%). The final theme was the specificity of the feedback. Just over half of comments (n = 190, 54.3%) contained specific feedback, which could be applied to future cases. However, 51 comments (14.6%) contained no useful information for the learners.; CONCLUSIONS: An app-based system resulted in thoracic surgery residents receiving identifiable feedback in a high proportion of cases. In over half of comments the feedback was specific enough to allow improvement. Feedback was better quality when addressing error prevention and surgical technique but was less useful when addressing communication, flow of the case, and assisting. Faculty development around feedback should focus on making feedback specific and actionable, avoiding case descriptions, or simple platitudes. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: Critical appraisal of clinical evidence promises to help prevent, detect, and address flaws related to study importance, ethics, validity, applicability, and reporting. These research issues are of growing concern. The purpose of this scoping review is to survey the current literature on evidence appraisal to develop a conceptual framework and an informatics research agenda.; Methods: We conducted an iterative literature search of Medline for discussion or research on the critical appraisal of clinical evidence. After title and abstract review, 121 articles were included in the analysis. We performed qualitative thematic analysis to describe the evidence appraisal architecture and its issues and opportunities. From this analysis, we derived a conceptual framework and an informatics research agenda.; Results: We identified 68 themes in 10 categories. This analysis revealed that the practice of evidence appraisal is quite common but is rarely subjected to documentation, organization, validation, integration, or uptake. This is related to underdeveloped tools, scant incentives, and insufficient acquisition of appraisal data and transformation of the data into usable knowledge.; Discussion: The gaps in acquiring appraisal data, transforming the data into actionable information and knowledge, and ensuring its dissemination and adoption can be addressed with proven informatics approaches.; Conclusions: Evidence appraisal faces several challenges, but implementing an informatics research agenda would likely help realize the potential of evidence appraisal for improving the rigor and value of clinical evidence. © The Author 2017.

AB In order for human microbiome studies to translate into actionable outcomes for health, meta-analysis of reproducible data from population-scale cohorts is needed. Achieving sufficient reproducibility in microbiome research has proven challenging. We report a baseline investigation of variability in taxonomic profiling for the Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) project baseline study (MBQC-base). Blinded specimen sets from human stool, chemostats, and artificial microbial communities were sequenced by 15 laboratories and analyzed using nine bioinformatics protocols. Variability depended most on biospecimen type and origin, followed by DNA extraction, sample handling environment, and bioinformatics. Analysis of artificial community specimens revealed differences in extraction efficiency and bioinformatic classification. These results may guide researchers in experimental design choices for gut microbiome studies.

AB De novo and acquired resistance, which are largely attributed to genetic alterations, are barriers to effective anti-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) therapy. To generate cetuximab-resistant cells, we exposed cetuximab-sensitive colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab in three-dimensional culture. Using whole-exome sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we found that the long non-coding RNA MIR100HG and two embedded microRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125b, were overexpressed in the absence of known genetic events linked to cetuximab resistance. MIR100HG, miR-100 and miR-125b overexpression was also observed in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer cell lines and in tumors from colorectal cancer patients that progressed on cetuximab. miR-100 and miR-125b coordinately repressed five Wnt/beta-catenin negative regulators, resulting in increased Wnt signaling, and Wnt inhibition in cetuximab-resistant cells restored cetuximab responsiveness. Our results describe a double-negative feedback loop between MIR100HG and the transcription factor GATA6, whereby GATA6 represses MIR100HG, but this repression is relieved by miR-125b targeting of GATA6. These findings identify a clinically actionable, epigenetic cause of cetuximab resistance.

AB The variable penetrance of pathogenic variants (PVs) represents a major challenge to the field of human genetics, often complicating clinical decision-making and risk management. Nonpenetrance, the detection of PVs in the absence of disease manifestation, is a common phenomenon, yet, we know very little about the underlying factors, which may protect some individuals and not others. Placing a new focus on the genomic study of the healthy elderly may be pivotal for advancing our understanding of penetrance. Studying those who remain unaffected late into life, despite harboring known genetic risk variants, could provide important insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately inform clinical care, yet, it has received relatively little attention as a research strategy. The ever increasing use of sequencing technology is further driving the requirement to understand the penetrance of ascertained variants. The ASPREE Biobank of Healthy Ageing provides a unique opportunity to address this area of need. DNA has been collected from a cohort of over 14,000 healthy elderly individuals aged 70 years or older enrolled in an aspirin clinical trial. The ASPREE cohort represents a healthy reference population ascertained without the typical biases of a genetic study. The cohort is depleted of expressed monogenetic disease, yet will contain hundreds of elderly individuals with known PVs in clinically actionable genes. Investigating this population along with other cohorts of the healthy elderly will provide critical new knowledge into the penetrance of actionable variants as a foundation for informing clinical care.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a multistage tracking system could improve communication between health care providers, reducing the risk of delay in diagnosis related to inconsistent communication and tracking of radiology follow-up recommendations.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unconditional recommendations for imaging follow-up of all diagnostic imaging modalities excluding mammography (n = 589) were entered into a database and tracked through a multistage tracking system for 13 months. Tracking interventions were performed for patients for whom completion of recommended follow-up imaging could not be identified 1 month after the recommendation due date. Postintervention compliance with the follow-up recommendation required examination completion or clinical closure (i.e., biopsy, limited life expectancy or death, or subspecialist referral).; RESULTS: Baseline radiology information system checks performed 1 month after the recommendation due date revealed timely completion of 43.1% of recommended imaging studies at our institution before intervention. Three separate tracking interventions were studied, showing effectiveness between 29.0% and 57.8%. The multistage tracking system increased the examination completion rate to 70.5% (a 52% increase) and reduced the rate of unknown follow-up compliance and the associated risk of delay in diagnosis to 13.9% (a 74% decrease). Examinations completed after tracking intervention generated revenue of 4.1 times greater than the labor cost.; CONCLUSION: Performing sequential radiology recommendation tracking interventions can substantially reduce the rate of unknown follow-up compliance and add value to the health system. Unknown follow-up compliance is a risk factor for delay in diagnosis, a form of preventable medical error commonly identified in malpractice claims involving radiologists and office-based practitioners.

AB Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) follow a slowly progressing dysfunctional trajectory, with a large presymptomatic component and many comorbidities. Using preclinical models and large-scale omics studies ranging from genetics to imaging, a large number of processes that might be involved in AD pathology at different stages and levels have been identified. The sheer number of putative hypotheses makes it almost impossible to estimate their contribution to the clinical outcome and to develop a comprehensive view on the pathological processes driving the clinical phenotype. Traditionally, bioinformatics approaches have provided correlations and associations between processes and phenotypes. Focusing on causality, a new breed of advanced and more quantitative modeling approaches that use formalized domain expertise offer new opportunities to integrate these different modalities and outline possible paths toward new therapeutic interventions. This article reviews three different computational approaches and their possible complementarities. Process algebras, implemented using declarative programming languages such as Maude, facilitate simulation and analysis of complicated biological processes on a comprehensive but coarse-grained level. A model-driven Integration of Data and Knowledge, based on the OpenBEL platform and using reverse causative reasoning and network jump analysis, can generate mechanistic knowledge and a new, mechanism-based taxonomy of disease. Finally, Quantitative Systems Pharmacology is based on formalized implementation of domain expertise in a more fine-grained, mechanism-driven, quantitative, and predictive humanized computer model. We propose a strategy to combine the strengths of these individual approaches for developing powerful modeling methodologies that can provide actionable knowledge for rational development of preventive and therapeutic interventions. Development of these computational approaches is likely to be required for further progress in understanding and treating AD. Copyright © 2017 the Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a subtype of biliary tract malignancy with poor prognosis and high fatality rate. The present study was designed to uncover somatic and rare germline mutations in GBC to reveal the disease biology and understand the clinical importance of mutation profile in terms of prognostics and actionability.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed ultra-deep sequencing across 409 cancer-related genes in 11 GBC patients of North-Indian descent. NGS data analysis was performed using Ion Reporter and several other publicly available resources and databases.; RESULTS: We identified 184 nonsynonymous somatic and 60 rare germline mutations in bona-fide cancer drivers such as SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C), and tumor protein p53 (TP53). All the early-onset cases or hypermutated cases harbored mutation(s) in critical DNA-repair genes. Additionally, we detected 9 novel genes with high-impact somatic mutations in GBC.; CONCLUSION: Our results indicated the significance of inherited rare germline mutations in DNA-repair pathway genes in addition to acquired somatic mutations in GB carcinogenesis.

AB Purpose: Targeted agents and immunotherapies promise to transform the treatment of metastatic bladder cancer, but therapy selection will depend on practical tumor molecular stratification. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is established in several solid malignancies as a minimally invasive tool to profile the tumor genome in real-time, but is critically underexplored in bladder cancer.Experimental Design: We applied a combination of whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing across 50 bladder cancer driver genes to plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from 51 patients with aggressive bladder cancer, including 37 with metastatic disease.Results: The majority of patients with metastasis, but only 14% of patients with localized disease, had ctDNA proportions above 2% of total cfDNA (median 16.5%, range 3.9%-72.6%). Twelve percent of estimable samples had evidence of genome hypermutation. We reveal an aggressive mutational landscape in metastatic bladder cancer with 95% of patients harboring deleterious alterations to TP53, RB1, or MDM2, and 70% harboring a mutation or disrupting rearrangement affecting chromatin modifiers such as ARID1A Targetable alterations in MAPK/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were robustly detected, including amplification of ERBB2 (20% of patients) and activating hotspot mutations in PIK3CA (20%), with the latter mutually exclusive to truncating mutations in TSC1 A novel FGFR3 gene fusion was identified in consecutive samples from one patient.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that ctDNA provides a practical and cost-effective snapshot of driver gene status in metastatic bladder cancer. The identification of a wide spectrum of clinically informative somatic alterations nominates ctDNA as a tool to dissect disease pathogenesis and guide therapy selection in patients with metastatic bladder cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: A barrier to the use of genomic information during prescribing is the limited number of software solutions that combine a user-friendly interface with complex medical data. We built and designed an online, secure, electronic custom interface termed the Genomic Prescribing System (GPS).; METHODS: Actionable pharmacogenomic (PGx) information was reviewed, collected, and stored in the back-end of GPS to enable creation of customized drug- and variant-specific clinical decision support (CDS) summaries. The database architecture utilized the star schema to store information. Patient raw genomic data underwent transformation via custom-designed algorithms to enable gene and phenotype-level associations. Multiple external data sets (PubMed, The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), National Drug File - Reference Terminology (ND-FRT), and a publically-available PGx knowledgebase) were integrated to facilitate the delivery of patient, drug, disease, and genomic information. Institutional security infrastructure was leveraged to securely store patient genomic and clinical data on a HIPAA-compliant server farm.; RESULTS: As of May 17, 2016, the GPS back-end housed 257 CDS encompassing 112 genetic variants, 42 genes, and 46 PGx-actionable drugs. The GPS user interface presented patient-specific CDS alongside a recognizable traffic light symbol (green/yellow/red), denoting PGx risk for each genomic result. The number of traffic lights per visit increased with the corresponding increase in the number of available PGx-annotated drugs over time. An integrated drug and disease search functionality, links to primary literature sources, and potential alternative PGx drugs were indicated. The system, which was initially used as stand-alone CDS software within our clinical environment, was then integrated with the institutional electronic medical record for enhanced usability. There have been nearly 2000 logins in 43months since inception, with usage exceeding 56 logins per month and system up-times of 99.99%. For all patient-provider visits encompassing >3years of implementation, unique alert click-through rates corresponded to genomic risk: red lights clicked 100%, yellow lights 79%, green lights 43%.; CONCLUSIONS: Successful deployment of GPS by combining complex data and recognizable iconography led to a tool that enabled point-of-care genomic delivery with high usability. Continued scalability and incorporation of additional clinical elements to be considered alongside PGx information could expand future impact. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) quantify, from patients' perspectives, their symptoms, function, and quality of life. Our aim was to determine the feasibility of integrating PRO capture into routine clinical practice at a large heart failure (HF) clinic.; METHODS: We examined the practicality of PRO completion at the time of clinic visit, the time required to complete the selected instruments, the completion rate, and the feasibility of immediate PRO scoring and integration of the results into the electronic health record (EHR). We deployed a computer program to capture PROs (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) on a portable computer platform at the time of a clinic visit. An automated algorithm identified patients scheduled for appointments at the HF clinic at registration, provided a portable tablet computer with which to complete the appropriate PRO instruments and then scored and immediately integrated the results in the patient's EHR.; RESULTS: In a 12-month period, 862 unique patients completed 1,320 PRO assessments. The mean age of this cohort was 60.1±16.3 years and 66% were male. The average time for PRO assessment was 6.7minutes and the completion rate among eligible patients was 58%, with 91% of started assessments completed in full.; CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data support the feasibility of serial PRO assessment with real-time integration into the EHR in a large outpatient population of patients with HF. We identified critical steps that should enhance adoption of this approach by clinicians and render PRO results meaningful and actionable in routine clinical care. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Time-sensitive alerts are among the many types of clinical notifications delivered to physicians' secure InBaskets within commercial electronic health records (EHRs). A delayed alert review can impact patient safety and compromise care.; OBJECTIVE: To characterize factors associated with opening of non-interruptive time-sensitive alerts delivered into primary care provider (PCP) InBaskets.; DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data for 799 automated alerts. Alerts highlighted actionable medication concerns for older patients post-hospital discharge (2010-2011). These were study-generated alerts sent 3days post-discharge to InBaskets for 75 PCPs across a multisite healthcare system, and represent a subset of all urgent InBasket notifications.; MAIN MEASURES: Using EHR access and audit logs to track alert opening, we performed bivariate and multivariate analyses calculating associations between patient characteristics, provider characteristics, contextual factors at the time of alert delivery (number of InBasket notifications, weekday), and alert opening within 24h.; KEY RESULTS: At the time of alert delivery, the PCPs had a median of 69 InBasket notifications and had received a median of 379.8 notifications (IQR 295.0, 492.0) over the prior 7days. Of the 799 alerts, 47.1% were opened within 24h. Patients with longer hospital stays (>4days) were marginally more likely to have alerts opened (OR 1.48 [95% CI 1.00-2.19]). Alerts delivered to PCPs whose InBaskets had a higher number of notifications at the time of alert delivery were significantly less likely to be opened within 24h (top quartile >157 notifications: OR 0.34 [95% CI 0.18-0.61]; reference bottom quartile ≤42). Alerts delivered on Saturdays were also less likely to be opened within 24h (OR 0.18 [CI 0.08-0.39]).; CONCLUSIONS: The number of total InBasket notifications and weekend delivery may impact the opening of time-sensitive EHR alerts. Further study is needed to support safe and effective approaches to care team management of InBasket notifications.

AB OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this report is to describe a quality improvement practice designed to identify and categorize potentially preventable medication-related hospital admissions. The secondary objective is to present data collected from this practice and describe how it was used to improve a pharmacist intervention focused on reducing medication-related readmissions.; SETTING: This practice was developed as part of the quality improvement system supporting a pharmacist-led care transition model that was implemented across rural and urban counties in Hawaii.; PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Pharmacists systematically assessed readmissions of the high-risk patients who were enrolled in the care transition model to determine the reasons for the admission and whether each was potentially preventable and medication related. This information was then used to improve the care transition model.; PRACTICE INNOVATION: This admission categorization system is the first based on best practice in pharmaceutical care and identifies indication, effectiveness, safety, and adherence problems, as well as subcategories within each of those domains.; EVALUATION: This quality improvement practice was applied to 401 readmissions. A chi-square test was used to determine if there were differences between urban and more rural areas regarding percentage of readmissions that were potentially preventable and medication related.; RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of the readmissions were determined to be potentially preventable and medication related. The most common categories were nonadherence due to patient choice (23.8%), untreated condition for which medication is indicated (13.3%), dose too high (10.5%), and dose too low (10.5%). The percentage of readmissions that were potentially preventable and medication related was significantly higher in more rural areas (30%) compared with urban areas (17%). There were no significant rural-urban differences by major category of potentially preventable medication-related admissions.; CONCLUSION: This systematic and actionable approach to reviewing and categorizing potentially preventable medication-related admissions can facilitate improvement in care and document the value of pharmacists serving in patient care roles.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe components fundamental to the process of linking pharmacy to the delivery of public health services in a sustainable way.; SUMMARY: Pharmacists deliver public health services with varying frequency. A literature review was conducted to create a set of fundamental links necessary for pharmacists to deliver public health services in a sustainable way. The service needed to be in alignment with public health priorities, be incorporated in the pharmacy curriculum, have postgraduate training opportunities, have a policy or legal platform supporting the service, and have a business model for financial sustainability. Immunization delivery was identified as an exemplary public health service delivered by pharmacists. Additional services evaluated were tobacco cessation counseling, transitions of care, hypertension screening, and substance abuse counseling.; CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are well positioned to provide public health services. Although pharmacists can offer these services, their delivery is variable because of unclearly defined links in the process necessary for their implementation. This article identifies actionable steps to establish sustainable methods for community pharmacists to deliver public health services. Copyright © 2017 American Pharmacists Association.

AB Tumor recurrence remains the main reason for breast cancer-associated mortality, and there are unmet clinical demands for the discovery of new biomarkers and development of treatment solutions to benefit patients with breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. Here we report the identification of chromosomal copy-number amplification at 1q21.3 that is enriched in subpopulations of breast cancer cells bearing characteristics of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and that strongly associates with breast cancer recurrence. Amplification is present in 10-30% of primary tumors but in more than 70% of recurrent tumors, regardless of breast cancer subtype. Detection of amplification in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood is strongly associated with early relapse in patients with breast cancer and could also be used to track the emergence of tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We further show that 1q21.3-encoded S100 calcium-binding protein (S100A) family members, mainly S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9 (S100A7/8/9), and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) establish a reciprocal feedback loop driving tumorsphere growth. Notably, this functional circuitry can be disrupted by the small-molecule kinase inhibitor pacritinib, leading to preferential impairment of the growth of 1q21.3-amplified breast tumors. Our study uncovers the 1q21.3-directed S100A7/8/9-IRAK1 feedback loop as a crucial component of breast cancer recurrence, serving as both a trackable biomarker and an actionable therapeutic target for breast cancer.

AB OBJECTIVES: Create trustworthy, rigorous, national clinical practice guidelines for the practice of pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death in Canada.; METHODS: We followed a process of clinical practice guideline development based on World Health Organization and Canadian Medical Association methods. This included application of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Questions requiring recommendations were generated based on 1) 2006 Canadian donation after circulatory determination of death guidelines (not pediatric specific), 2) a multidisciplinary symposium of national and international pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death leaders, and 3) a scoping review of the pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death literature. Input from these sources drove drafting of actionable questions and Good Practice Statements, as defined by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group. We performed additional literature reviews for all actionable questions. Evidence was assessed for quality using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation and then formulated into evidence profiles that informed recommendations through the evidence-to-decision framework. Recommendations were revised through consensus among members of seven topic-specific working groups and finalized during meetings of working group leads and the planning committee. External review was provided by pediatric, critical care, and critical care nursing professional societies and patient partners.; RESULTS: We generated 63 Good Practice Statements and seven Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendations covering 1) ethics, consent, and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, 2) eligibility, 3) withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy practices, 4) ante and postmortem interventions, 5) death determination, 6) neonatal pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death, 7) cardiac and innovative pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death, and 8) implementation. For brevity, 48 Good Practice Statement and truncated justification are included in this summary report. The remaining recommendations, detailed methodology, full Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tables, and expanded justifications are available in the full text report.; CONCLUSIONS: This process showed that rigorous, transparent clinical practice guideline development is possible in the domain of pediatric deceased donation. Application of these recommendations will increase access to pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death across Canada and may serve as a model for future clinical practice guideline development in deceased donation.

AB BACKGROUND: Healthcare transition from pediatric to adult care for young adults (YA) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with risk of adverse outcomes. Consensus recommendations exist from US professional societies on transition care for YA with T1D, but it is not known whether they have been widely adopted. We describe experiences, barriers, and provider characteristics associated with transition care in a national sample of pediatric endocrinologists.; METHODS: US pediatric endocrinologists identified through the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile were sent an electronic survey.; RESULTS: Response rate was 16% (164/1020) representing 32 states. The majority of pediatric endocrinologists (age 44±10; years in practice 12±11) were female (67%) and worked in academic centers (75%). Main reasons for transfer were age (49%) and glycemic control (18%). Barriers to transition included ending long-therapeutic relationships with patients (74%), lack of transition protocols (46%), and perceived deficiencies in adult care (42%). The majority of pediatric endocrinologists reported lack of transition training (68%); those who received training were less likely to have difficulty ending patient relationships [odds ratio (OR)=0.39, P=.03], more likely to perform patient record transfer to adult systems (OR=1.27, P=.006), and less likely to report patient returns to pediatric care after transfer (OR=0.49, P=.01), independent of endocrinologist gender, years in practice, or practice type.; CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in transition care for YA with T1D among US pediatric endocrinologists despite consensus recommendations. Dissemination of educational programming on transition care and provision of actionable solutions to overcome local health system and perceived barriers is needed. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy, readability, understandability, and actionability of Internet patient education materials (PEM) about transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.; METHODS: A comprehensive Internet search was performed to find PEM with pre- or postbiopsy instructions. PEM that were duplicates, government affiliated, international, or video based were excluded. Biopsy instructions were evaluated for accuracy and presence of essential topics. Readability was assessed via word count and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Understandability and actionability were measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Effects of authorship and geographical variation were determined using Fischer exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests.; RESULTS: We identified 148 unique PEM. Only 31 (21%) sites adhered to the recommended <8th grade reading level. Most PEM did not contain recommended graphics (14%), checklists (2%), or summaries (6%). The PEMAT understandability score for academic PEM was higher than private (P=.02) and unaffiliated PEM (P=.01). No websites had inaccurate content. Only 2 PEM sites (1%) included all essential content (stop anticoagulants, antibiotics, need for urinalysis, biopsy pain, when to resume activity, and bleeding complications). Few significant differences based on geographic region were observed for word count, readability, PEMAT scores, or content.; CONCLUSION: Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy PEM adhere poorly to guidelines for easy-to-understand materials. Most PEM lack vital information and are written at a reading level that is too complex for patient comprehension. The urology community can construct better websites by consulting PEM advisory materials and providing nontechnical language, figures, and specific instructions. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Primary Care Capacity Project (PCCP), implemented by the Louisiana Public Health Institute, systematically and rigorously applied qualitative methodologies beyond simple interviews and focus groups to develop the project areas of focus, evaluate clinical transformation interventions in selected heath centers along the Gulf Coast, and provide data and support to foster ongoing quality improvement approaches. Qualitative methodologies were utilized for formative, implementation, and summative evaluation. During the early formative stages of PCCP, community prioritization meetings were conducted in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, in which key stakeholders were asked to brainstorm and prioritize major health issues and recommendations in their communities. Findings from these meetings were then used to inform PCCP clinic funding and other community priorities. During project implementation, dyadic interviews were facilitated around specific PCCP areas of focus. These dyadic interviews were valuable in that they uncovered stories, successes, and challenges of clinical transformation. Moreover, they promoted peer-to-peer learning among diverse health centers. The relationships between interview participants are likely to continue past the grant period and further promote innovation and efficiency. Finally case studies were conducted to inform actionable recommendations tailored to each health center. These data also provided value add back to the health centers as they used the information to guide programming and quality improvement efforts. Qualitative methods are critical tools for public health practitioners to support project planning and improvement as well as community change.

AB INTRODUCTION: Emergency departments (EDs) have become the primary source of care for increasing number of patients, leading to treatment of nonemergent cases, which divert resources from true emergency situations and represent poor cost-effectiveness for treating such cases. There is evidence that suggests that patient navigation (PN) integrated into the ED and other case management techniques can help reduce the number of primary care-related ED visits and these navigation programs are more cost-effective than the ED visits themselves. The Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection Primary Care Capacity Project Quality Improvement Initiative (GNOPQii) is a pilot project aimed at improving the efficiency of PN for patients who have had avoidable ED encounters or inpatient readmissions through applied data and technology program.; METHODS: Partnering Federally Qualified Health Centers were equipped with actionable ED utilization data to integrate with their own patient clinical data to track patient ED activity. The pilot design also included the use of patient navigators to address the nonclinical cultural and behavioral barriers to care. As part of the overall evaluation, comparisons of data utilization and PN services pre- and post-GNOPQii were conducted.; RESULTS: A total of 337 referrals were made, and 145 patients were enrolled into the GNOPQii pilot program. The direct services needed the most by patients were transportation and medication resources. Of those who enrolled (N = 145), 63 patients graduated, meaning program compliance and 90 days without visits to the ED, resulting in a 43% success rate.; DISCUSSION: If an estimated $1898 savings for every nonemergency ED encounter replaced by an office-based encounter is applied to our results, the GNOPQii program contributed to a minimum of $119 574.00 savings even if only 1 deterred ED visit per graduate is assumed. Future research is needed to systematically test the efficacy of GNOPQii in reducing nonemergent ED visits.

AB The discovery of druggable oncogenic drivers (i.e. EGFR and ALK), along with the introduction of comprehensive tumor genotyping techniques into the daily clinical practice define non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) asa group of heterogeneous diseases, requiring a context-personalized clinico-therapeutical approach. Among the most investigated biomarkers, the MET proto-oncogene has been extensively demonstrated to play a crucial role throughout the lung oncogenesis, unbalancing the proliferation/apoptosis signaling and influencing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the invasive phenotype. Nevertheless, although different mechanisms eliciting the aberrant MET-associated oncogenic stimulus have been detected in lung cancer (such as gene amplification, increased gene copy number, mutations and MET/HGF overexpression), to date no clinically impactful results have been achieved with anti-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies in the context of an unselected or MET enriched population. Recently, MET exon 14 splicing abnormalities have been identified asa potential oncogenic target in lung cancer, able to drive the activity of MET inhibitors in molecularly selected patients. In this paper, the major advancement and drawbacks of MET history in lung cancer are reviewed, underlying the renewed scientific euphoria related to the recent identification of MET exon 14 splicing variants asan actionable oncogenic target.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) produced by gut microbiota metabolism of dietary choline and carnitine has been shown to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to provide incremental clinical prognostic utility beyond traditional risk factors for assessing a patient's CVD risk. The aim of this study was to develop an automated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy assay for quantification of TMAO concentration in serum and plasma using a high-throughput NMR clinical analyzer.; METHODS: Key steps in assay development included: (i) shifting the TMAO analyte peak to a less crowded region of the spectrum with a pH buffer/reagent, (ii) attenuating the broad protein background signal in the spectrum and (iii) using a non-negative least squares algorithm for peak deconvolution. Assay performance was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. A method comparison study was performed to compare TMAO concentrations quantified by NMR and mass spectrometry (MS).; RESULTS: The within-run and within-lab imprecision ranged from 4.3 to 14.5%. Under the acquisition method employed, the NMR assay had a limit of blank, detection and quantitation of 1.6, 3.0 and 3.3muM, respectively. Linearity was demonstrated within the reportable range of 3.3 to 3000muM. TMAO measurements using the NMR assay, which involves minimal sample preparation, compared well with values obtained with the MS-based assay (R2=0.98).; CONCLUSIONS: The NMR based assay provides a simple and accurate measurement of circulating TMAO levels amenable to the high-throughput demands of the clinical chemistry laboratory. Moreover, assay performance enables the levels of TMAO to be quantified in serum or plasma at clinically actionable concentrations for the assessment of cardiovascular disease risks and individualized dietary monitoring.

AB OBJECTIVES: Heterosexually active Black men are alleged to endorse masculine norms that increase their and their female partners' vulnerability to HIV. These norms include Black men's inability or reluctance to productively engage their own health-related personal and interpersonal vulnerabilities. We draw on data from the iSpeak research study in Ontario, Canada, to assess whether and how heterosexual Black men cope with personal and inter-personal vulnerability, namely that heterosexual Black men: avoid emotionally supportive relationships with other men (and women), which diminishes their capacity to productively acknowledge and resolve their health-related challenges; are reticent to productively acknowledge and address HIV and health on a personal level; and are pathologically secretive about their health, which compounds their vulnerability and precipitates poor health outcomes.; DESIGN: iSpeak was implemented in 2011 to 2013, and included two focus groups with HIV-positive and HIV-negative self-identified heterosexual men (N=14) in Toronto and London, a focus group with community-based health promotion practitioners who provide HIV-related services to Black communities in Ontario (N=6), and one-on-one interviews with four researchers distinguished for their scholarship with/among Black communities in Toronto. Participants in the men's focus group were recruited discretely through word-of-mouth. Focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Team members independently read the transcripts, and then met to identify, discuss and agree on the emerging themes.; RESULTS: We demonstrate that iSpeak participants (a) engage their personal and interpersonal vulnerabilities creatively and strategically, (b) complicate and challenge familiar interpretations of Black men's allegedly transgressive masculinity through their emotional and practical investment in their health, and (c) demonstrate a form of resourceful masculinity that ambiguously aligns with patriarchy.; CONCLUSION: We conclude with a range of actionable recommendations to strengthen the discursive framework for understanding heterosexual Black men in relation to HIV and health, and substantively engaging them in community responses to HIV.

AB Current cell-free DNA (cfDNA) next generation sequencing (NGS) precision oncology workflows are typically limited to targeted and/or disease-specific applications. In advanced cancer, disease burden and cfDNA tumor content are often elevated, yielding unique precision oncology opportunities. We sought to demonstrate the utility of a pan-cancer, rapid, inexpensive, whole genome NGS of cfDNA approach (PRINCe) as a precision oncology screening strategy via ultra-low coverage (~0.01x) tumor content determination through genome-wide copy number alteration (CNA) profiling. We applied PRINCe to a retrospective cohort of 124 cfDNA samples from 100 patients with advanced cancers, including 76 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), enabling cfDNA tumor content approximation and actionable focal CNA detection, while facilitating concordance analyses between cfDNA and tissue-based NGS profiles and assessment of cfDNA alteration associations with mCRPC treatment outcomes. Therapeutically relevant focal CNAs were present in 42 (34%) cfDNA samples, including 36 of 93 (39%) mCRPC patient samples harboring AR amplification. PRINCe identified pre-treatment cfDNA CNA profiles facilitating disease monitoring. Combining PRINCe with routine targeted NGS of cfDNA enabled mutation and CNA assessment with coverages tuned to cfDNA tumor content. In mCRPC, genome-wide PRINCe cfDNA and matched tissue CNA profiles showed high concordance (median Pearson correlation = 0.87), and PRINCe detectable AR amplifications predicted reduced time on therapy, independent of therapy type (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test, chi-square = 24.9, p < 0.0001). Our screening approach enables robust, broadly applicable cfDNA-based precision oncology for patients with advanced cancer through scalable identification of therapeutically relevant CNAs and pre-/post-treatment genomic profiles, enabling cfDNA- or tissue-based precision oncology workflow optimization.

AB Purpose: Molecular profiling in cancer has identified potential actionable drug targets that have prompted attempts to discover clinically validated biomarkers to guide therapeutic decision-making and enrollment to clinical trials. We evaluated whether comprehensive genetic analysis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is feasible within a clinically relevant timeframe and whether such analyses provide predictive and/or prognostic information along with identification of potential targets for therapy.Experimental Design: Archival or prospectively acquired FFPE samples and matched normal DNA from N = 336 patients with pancreatic cancer were analyzed using a hybridization capture-based, next-generation sequencing assay designed to perform targeted deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of 410 key cancer-associated genes. Demographic and treatment data were prospectively collected with the goal of correlating treatment outcomes and drug response with molecular profiles.Results: The median time from protocol consent to reporting of the genomic results was 45 days with a median time from tissue delivery of 20 days. All genetic alterations identified were stratified based upon prior evidence that the mutation is a predictive biomarker of drug response using the MSKCC OncoKB classification. Three of 225 patients (1%) received a matched therapy based upon the sequencing results.Conclusions: The practical application of molecular results to guide individual patient treatment is currently limited in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Future prospective molecular profiling efforts should seek to incorporate routine germline genetic analysis and the identification of DNA profiles that predict for clinical benefit from agents that target DNA damage repair and or immunotherapy.

AB Purpose: This single-institutional feasibility study prospectively characterized genomic alterations in recurrent or refractory solid tumors of pediatric patients to select a targeted therapy.Experimental Design: Following treatment failure, patients with signed consent and ages above 6 months, underwent tumor biopsy or surgical resection of primary or metastatic tumor site. These newly acquired samples were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization array, next-generation sequencing for 75 target genes, whole-exome and RNA sequencing. Biological significance of the alterations and suggestion of most relevant targeted therapies available were discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board.Results: From December 2012 to January 2016, 75 patients were included, 73 patients underwent 79 interventions, 56 of which were research biopsies with a low complication rate. All patients were pretreated, 37.0% had a brain tumor, and 63.0% had an extra-cranial solid tumor. Median tumor cell content was 70% (range, 0%-100%). Successful molecular analysis in 69 patients detected in 60.9% of patients an actionable alteration in various oncogenic pathways (42.4% with copy-number change, 33.3% with mutation, 2.1% with fusion), and change in diagnosis in three patients. Fourteen patients received 17 targeted therapies; two had received a matched treatment before inclusion.Conclusions: Research biopsies are feasible in advanced pediatric malignancies that exhibit a considerable amount of potentially actionable alterations. Genetic events affecting different cancer hallmarks and limited access to targeted agents within pediatric clinical trials remain the main obstacles that are addressed in our two subsequent precision medicine studies MAPPYACTS and AcSe-ESMART.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous group of soft tissue and bone tumors. Precise diagnosis of specific subtypes is challenging using conventional methods. Herein, we review the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology that is used for rapid sequencing of DNA and RNA.; RECENT FINDINGS: Recent sarcoma specific studies recommend that molecular genetic testing should be added at diagnosis for appropriate clinical management in addition to diagnosis by expert pathologists. NGS has already been used to identify potentially actionable mutations, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. Rationally, choosing a drug based on an individual patient profile aka: "precision oncology" has been so far limited to few case reports in sarcomas. As we improve our ability to deliver personalized medicine using all modalities including conventional therapy, more patients may eventually benefit. As the cost and capacity of NGS outpace Moore's law, so does the probability of success.

AB The incidence and mortality rates from endometrial cancer are increasing. There have been no new drugs approved for the treatment of endometrial cancer in decades. The National Cancer Institute, Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee identified the integration of molecular and/or histologic stratification into endometrial cancer management as a top strategic priority. Based on this, they convened a group of experts to review the molecular data in this disease. Here we report on the actionable opportunities and therapeutic directions identified for incorporation into future clinical trials.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite increased use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), some patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remain at high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Remote monitoring of pulmonary artery (PA) pressures provides clinicians with actionable information to help further optimize medications andimprove outcomes.; OBJECTIVES: CHAMPION (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Patients trial) analyzed PA pressure-guided heart failure (HF) management in patients with HFrEF based on their ability to tolerate GDMT.; METHODS: CHAMPION enrolled 550 patients with chronic HF regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction. A pre-specified sub-group analysis compared HF hospitalization and mortality rates between treatment and control groups in HFrEF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction≤40%). Post hoc analyses in patients who tolerated GDMT were also performed. Hospitalizations and mortality were assessed using Andersen-Gill and Cox proportional hazards models.; RESULTS: In 456 patients with HFrEF, HF hospitalization rates were 28% lower in the treatment group than in the control group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 0.88; p=0.0013), with a strong trend for 32% lower mortality (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.02; p=0.06). A 445-patient subset received at least 1 GDMT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, or beta-blocker) at baseline; these patients had 33% lower HF hospitalization rates (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.82; p=0.0002) and 47% lower mortality (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.96, p=0.0293) than controls. Compared with controls, patients receiving both components of optimal GDMT (n=337) had 43% lower HF hospitalizations (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.74; p< 0.0001) and 57% lower mortality (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.76; p=0.0026).; CONCLUSIONS: PA pressure-guided HF management reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF on GDMT, underscoring the important synergy of addressing hemodynamic and neurohormonal targets of HF therapy.

AB Cardiac sarcoma is a rare malignant tumor with undefined genetic mutations and no targeted therapy. Here in one rare case of undifferentiated cardiac intimal sarcoma (IS), a next-generation sequencing based assay, MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering - Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), identified a somatic, activating mutation in PDGFRB, along with amplification of PDGFRA. This E472D mutation of PDGFRB was discovered for the first time in IS. These findings suggest that concurrent aberrant PDGFRA and PDGFRB signaling may be a diagnostic biomarker and molecular therapeutic target of IS of the heart.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinicians ordering multi-gene next-generation sequencing panels for hereditary breast cancer risk have a variety of test panel options. Many panels include lesser known breast cancer genes or genes associated with other cancers. The authors hypothesized that using broader gene panels increases the identification of clinically significant findings, some relevant and others incidental to the testing indication. They examined clinician ordering patterns and compared the yield of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in non-BRCA genes of female breast cancer patients.; METHODS: This study analyzed de-identified personal and family histories in 1085 breast cancer cases with P/LP multi-gene panel findings in non-BRCA cancer genes and sorted them into three groups by the panel used for testing: group A (breast cancer genes only), group B (commonly assessed cancers: breast, gynecologic, and gastrointestinal), and group C (a more expanded set of tumors). The frequency of P/LP variants in genes with established management guidelines was compared and evaluated for consistency with personal and family histories.; RESULTS: This study identified 1131 P/LP variants and compared variants in clinically actionable genes for breast and non-breast cancers. Overall, 91.5% of these variants were in genes with management guidelines. Nearly 12% were unrelated to personal or family history.; CONCLUSION: Broader panels were used for 85.6% of our cohort (groups B and C). Although pathogenic variants in non-BRCA genes are reportedly rare, the study found that most were in clinically actionable genes. Expanded panel testing improved the identification of hereditary cancer risk. Small, breast-limited panels may miss clinically relevant findings in genes associated with other heritable cancers.

AB Performance measurement must be meaningful to those being asked to contribute data and to the clinicians who are collecting the information. It must be actionable if performance measurement and reporting is to influence health system transformation. To date, measuring patient experiences in all parts of the healthcare system in Canada lags behind other countries. More attention needs to be paid to capturing patients with complex intersecting health and social problems that result from inequitable distribution of wealth and/or underlying structural inequities related to systemic issues such as racism and discrimination, colonialism and patriarchy. Efforts to better capture the experiences of patients who do not regularly access care and who speak English or French as a second language are also needed. Before investing heavily into collecting patient experience data as part of a performance measurement system the following ought to be considered: (1) ensuring value for and buy-in from clinicians who are being asked to collect the data and/or act on the results; (2) investment in the infrastructure to administer iterative, cost-effective patient/family experience data collection, analysis and reporting (e.g., automated software tools) and (3) incorporating practice support (e.g., facilitation) and health system opportunities to integrate the findings from patient experience surveys into policy and practice. Investment into the infrastructure of measuring, reporting and engaging clinicians in improving practice is needed for patient/caregiver experiences to be acted upon. © 2017 Longwoods Publishing.

AB Few susceptibility genes for gastric cancer have been identified. We sought to identify germline susceptibility genes from participants with gastric cancer from an international hereditary cancer research network. Adults with gastric cancer of any histology, and with a germline DNA sample (n=51), were retrospectively selected. For those without previously identified germline mutations (n=43), sequencing was performed for 706 candidate genes. Twenty pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified among 18 participants. Eight of the 18 participants had previous positive clinical testing, including six with CDH1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and two with pathogenic MSH2 and TP53 variants. Of the remaining 10, six were in BRCA1 DNA damage response pathway genes (ATM, ATR, BRCA2, BRIP1, FANCC, TP53), other variants were identified in CTNNA1, FLCN, SBDS, and GNAS. Participants identified with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were younger at gastric cancer diagnosis than those without, 39.1 versus 48.0 years, and over 50% had a close family member with gastric cancer (p-values<0.0001). In conclusion, many participants were identified with mutations in clinically-actionable genes. Age of onset and family history of gastric cancer were mutation status predictors. Our findings support multigene panels in identifying gastric cancer predisposition. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: This clinical practice guideline was developed to determine the level of evidence supporting the clinical utility of commercially available multigene profiling assays and to provide guidance about whether certain breast cancer patient populations in Ontario would benefit from alternative tests in addition to Oncotype dx (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, U.S.A.).; METHODS: A systematic electronic Ovid search of the medline and embase databases sought out systematic reviews and primary literature. A systematic review and practice guideline was written by a working group and was then reviewed and approved by Cancer Care Ontario's Molecular Oncology Advisory Committee.; RESULTS: Twenty-four studies assessing the clinical utility of Oncotype dx, Prosigna (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.), EndoPredict (Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, U.S.A.), and MammaPrint (Agendia, Irvine, CA, U.S.A.) were included in the evidence base.; CONCLUSIONS: The clinical utility of multigene profiling assays is currently established for an appropriate subset of patients with estrogen receptor-positive, her2-negative, node-negative breast cancer for whom a decision to give chemotherapy is difficult to make. For patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumours who receive tamoxifen alone, Oncotype dx, Prosigna, and EndoPredict validly identify a low-risk population with favourable outcomes, indicating that a low-risk assay result is actionable and the decision to withhold chemotherapy is supported. Clinical evidence indicates that a high Oncotype dx recurrence score can predict for chemotherapy benefit, but a high Prosigna or EndoPredict score, although prognostic, is not, based on clinical trial evidence, directly actionable. Prosigna and EndoPredict are statistically more likely to identify a population at risk for recurrence beyond 5 years, but that information is currently not actionable because of a lack of interventional studies.

AB There has been very limited study of patients with chronic disease receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. Primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. Of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age=57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. In contrast, control arm participants (n=101; mean age=58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. A total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. We found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. Genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. Our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. Disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. In conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. These results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.

AB Background: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA) are chemotherapy-sensitive tumors with prolonged survival after radiochemotherapy. We report a prospective trial using induction temozolomide (TMZ) followed by myeloablative high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT) as a potential strategy to defer radiotherapy.; Methods: Patients with AO/AOA received 6 cycles of TMZ (200 mg/m2 * 5/28 day). Responding patients were eligible for HDC (thiotepa 250 mg/m2/day * 3 days, then busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day * 3 days), followed by ASCT. Genomic characterization was performed using next-generation sequencing.; Results: Forty-one patients were enrolled; 85% had 1p/19q codeleted tumors. After induction, 26 patients were eligible for HDC-ASCT and 21 agreed to proceed. There were no unexpected adverse events or toxic deaths. After median follow-up of 66 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) for transplanted patients was 86%, 5-year PFS 60%, and no patient has died. Among all 1p/19q codeleted patients (N = 33), 5-year PFS was 50% and 5-year overall survival (OS) 93%, with median time to radiotherapy not reached. Next-generation sequencing disclosed typical oligodendroglioma-related mutations, including IDH1, TERT, CIC, and FUBP1 mutations in 1p/19q codeleted patients, and glioblastoma-like signatures in 1p/19q intact patients. Aside from IDH1, potentially oncogenic/actionable mutations were variable, depicting wide molecular heterogeneity within oligodendroglial tumors.; Conclusions: TMZ followed by HDC-ASCT can be safely administered to patients with newly diagnosed 1p/19q codeleted AO. This strategy was associated with promising PFS and OS, suggesting that a chemotherapy-based approach may delay the need for radiotherapy and radiation-related toxicities.

AB Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are widely used to identify clinically actionable molecular alterations or perform retrospective molecular studies. Our goal was to quantify degradation of DNA occurring during mid to long-term storage of samples in usual conditions. We selected 46 FFPE samples of surgically resected carcinomas of lung, colon, and urothelial tract, of which DNA had been previously extracted. We performed a second DNA extraction on the same blocks under identical conditions after a median period of storage of 5.5years. Quantitation of DNA by fluorimetry showed a 53% decrease in DNA quantity after storage. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting KRAS exon 2 showed delayed amplification of DNA extracted after storage in all samples but one. The qPCR/fluorimetry quantification ratio decreased from 56 to 15% after storage (p<0.001). Overall, remaining proportion of DNA analyzable by qPCR represented only 11% of the amount obtained at first extraction. Maximal length of amplifiable DNA fragments assessed with a multiplex PCR was reduced in DNA extracted from stored tissue, indicating that DNA fragmentation had increased in the paraffin blocks during storage. Next-generation sequencing was performed on 12 samples and showed a mean 3.3-fold decrease in library yield and a mean 4.5-fold increase in the number of single-nucleotide variants detected after storage. In conclusion, we observed significant degradation of DNA extracted from the same FFPE block after 4 to 6years of storage. Better preservation strategies should be considered for storage of FFPE biopsy specimens.

AB Comprehensive genetic profiling is increasingly important for the clinical workup of hematologic tumors, as specific alterations are now linked to diagnostic characterization, prognostic stratification and therapy selection. To characterize relevant genetic and genomic alterations in myeloid malignancies maximally, we utilized a comprehensive strategy spanning fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), classical karyotyping, Chromosomal Microarray (CMA) for detection of copy number variants (CNVs) and Next generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In our cohort of 569 patients spanning the myeloid spectrum, NGS and CMA testing frequently identified mutations and copy number changes in the majority of genes with important clinical associations, such as TP53, TET2, RUNX1, SRSF2, APC and ATM. Most importantly, NGS and CMA uncovered medically actionable aberrations in 75.6% of cases normal by FISH/cytogenetics testing. NGS identified mutations in 65.5% of samples normal by CMA, cytogenetics and FISH, whereas CNVs were detected in 10.1% cases that were normal by all other methodologies. Finally, FISH or cytogenetics, or both, were abnormal in 14.1% of cases where NGS or CMA failed to detect any changes. Multiple mutations and CNVs were found to coexist, with potential implications for patient stratification. Thus, high throughput genomic tumor profiling through targeted DNA sequencing and CNV analysis complements conventional methods and leads to more frequent detection of actionable alterations.

AB OBJECTIVES: To understand how a statewide data infrastructure, including clinical and multipayer claims data, can inform preventive care and reduce medical expenditures for patients with diabetes.; STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 1-year cross-sectional analysis of claims linked to clinical data for 6719 patients with diabetes in 2014 to evaluate impacts of comorbidities on the total cost of care.; METHODS: Initially, variation in healthcare expenditures was examined versus a measure of disease control (most recent glycated hemoglobin [A1C] test results). Multivariable linear regression calculated the relative impact of a series of risk factors on medical expenditures. Poisson regression estimated the relative impact on inpatient hospital admissions. Possible savings were estimated with a reduction in potentially avoidable hospital admissions.; RESULTS: No linear relationship was found between A1C and same-year medical expenditures. Comorbidities in the population with diabetes with the largest relative impact on expenditures and inpatient hospital admissions were renal failure, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and discordant blood pressure. Diabetes plus congestive heart failure had the highest cost per inpatient admission; diabetes plus body mass index (BMI) ≥35 had the highest aggregate costs and potential savings.; CONCLUSIONS: A statewide data infrastructure can be used to identify criteria for outreach and population management of diabetes. The selection criteria are applicable across a statewide population and are associated with a higher relative impact on near-term expenditures than recent A1C test results. Whole-population data aggregation can be used to develop actionable information that is particularly relevant as independent organizations work together under alternative payment model arrangements.

AB Safety culture is a key component of patient safety. Many patient safety strategies in health care have been adapted from high-reliability organizations (HRO) such as aviation. However, to date, attempts to transform the cultures of health care settings through HRO approaches have had mixed results. We propose a methodological approach for safety culture research, which integrates the theory and practice of restoration science with the principles and methods of deliberative dialogue to support active engagement in critical reflection and collective debate. Our aim is to describe how these two innovative approaches in health services research can be used together to provide a comprehensive effective method to study and implement change in safety culture. Restorative research in health care integrates socio-ecological theory of complex adaptive systems concepts with collaborative, place-sensitive study of local practice contexts. Deliberative dialogue brings together all stakeholders to collectively develop solutions on an issue to facilitate change. Together these approaches can be used to actively engage people in the study of safety culture to gain a better understanding of its elements. More importantly, we argue that the synergistic use of these approaches offers enhanced potential to move health care professionals towards actionable strategies to improve patient safety within today's complex health care systems. © The Author 2017.

AB The under-performance of supply chains presents a significant hindrance to disease control in developing countries. Stock-outs of essential medicines lead to treatment interruption which can force changes in patient drug regimens, drive drug resistance and increase mortality. This study is one of few to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of supply chain policies in reducing shortages and costs. This study develops a systems dynamics simulation model of the downstream supply chain for amikacin, a second-line tuberculosis drug using 10years of South African data. We evaluate current supply chain performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness and agility, following the widely-used Supply Chain Operation Reference framework. We simulate 141 scenarios that represent different combinations of supplier characteristics, inventory management strategies and demand forecasting methods to identify the Pareto optimal set of management policies that jointly minimize the number of shortages and total cost. Despite long supplier lead times and unpredictable demand, the amikacin supply chain is 98% reliable and agile enough to accommodate a 20% increase in demand without a shortage. However, this is accomplished by overstocking amikacin by 167%, which incurs high holding costs. The responsiveness of suppliers is low: only 57% of orders are delivered to the central provincial drug depot within one month. We identify three Pareto optimal safety stock management policies. Short supplier lead time can produce Pareto optimal outcomes even in the absence of other optimal policies. This study produces concrete, actionable guidelines to cost-effectively reduce stock-outs by implementing optimal supply chain policies. Preferentially selecting drug suppliers with short lead times accommodates unexpected changes in demand. Optimal supply chain management should be an essential component of national policy to reduce the mortality rate. © The Author 2017.

AB AIMS: Breast myxoid fibroadenomas (MFAs) are characterized by a distinctive hypocellular myxoid stroma, and occur sporadically or in the context of Carney complex, an inheritable condition caused by PRKAR1A-inactivating germline mutations. Conventional fibroadenomas (FAs) are underpinned by recurrent MED12 mutations in the stromal components of the lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic landscape of MFAs and compare it with that of conventional FAs.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven MFAs from patients without clinical and/or genetic evidence of Carney complex were retrieved. DNA samples of tumour and matching normal tissue were subjected to massively parallel sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay, an assay targeting 410 cancer genes. Genetic alterations detected by MSK-IMPACT were tested in samples in which the stromal and epithelial components were separately laser capture-microdissected. Sequencing revealed no germline PRKAR1A mutations and non-synonymous mutations in six MFAs. Interestingly, in three of the MFAs in which the stromal and epithelial components were separately microdissected, the mutations were found to be restricted to the epithelial rather than the stromal component. The sole exception was a lesion harbouring a somatic truncating PRKAR1A mutation. Upon histological re-review, this case was reclassified as a breast myxoma, consistent with the spectrum of tumous observed in Carney complex patients. In this case, the PRKAR1A somatic mutation was restricted to the stromal component.; CONCLUSION: MFAs lack MED12 mutations, and their stromal components seem not to harbour mutations in the 410 cancer genes tested. Whole-exome and/or whole-genome analyses of MFAs are required to elucidate their genetic drivers. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Lung cancer encompasses multiple malignant epithelial tumour types, each with specific targetable, potentially actionable mutations, such that precision management mandates accurate tumour typing. Molecular characterisation studies require high tumour cell content and low necrosis content, yet lung cancers are frequently a heterogeneous mixture of tumour and stromal cells. We hypothesised that there may be systematic differences in tumour cell content according to histological subtype, and that this may have implications for tumour banks as a resource for comprehensive molecular characterisation studies in lung cancer. To investigate this, we estimated tumour cell and necrosis content of 4267 samples resected from 752 primary lung tumour specimens contributed to a lung tissue bank. We found that banked lung cancer samples had low tumour cell content (33%) generally, although it was higher in carcinoids (77.5%) than other lung cancer subtypes. Tumour cells comprise a variable and often small component of banked resected tumour samples, and are accompanied by stromal reaction, inflammation, fibrosis, and normal structures. This has implications for the adequacy of unselected tumour bank samples for diagnostic and molecular investigations, and further research is needed to determine whether tumour cell content has a significant impact on analytical results in studies using tissue from tumour bank resources.

AB Genetic testing has multiple clinical applications including disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics can be utilized to predict whether a pharmacologic therapy will be effective or to identify patients at risk for treatment-related toxicity. Although genetic tests are typically ordered for a distinct clinical purpose, the genetic variants that are found may have additional implications for either disease or pharmacology. This review will address multiple examples of germline genetic variants that are informative for both disease and pharmacogenomics. The discussed relationships are diverse. Some of the agents are targeted for the disease-causing genetic variant, while others, although not targeted therapies, have implications for the disease they are used to treat. It is also possible that the disease implications of a genetic variant are unrelated to the pharmacogenomic implications. Some of these examples are considered clinically actionable pharmacogenes, with evidence-based, pharmacologic treatment recommendations, while others are still investigative as areas for additional research. It is important that clinicians are aware of both the disease and pharmacogenomic associations of these germline genetic variants to ensure patients are receiving comprehensive personalized care.

AB Despite efforts to prevent the appearance and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union, several Member States are now affected (Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Estonia). Disease appearance in 2014 was associated with multiple entrances linked to wild boar movement from endemic areas (EFSA Journal, 8, 2015, 1556), but the risk of new introductions remains high (Gallardo etal., Porcine Health Management, 1, and 21) as ASF continues to be active in endemic countries (Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine). Since 2014, the number of ASF notifications has increased substantially, particularly in wild boar (WB), in parallel with slow but constant geographical advance of the disease. This situation suggests a real risk of further disease spread into other Member States, posing a great threat to pig production in the EU. Following the principles of the risk-based veterinary surveillance, this article applies a methodology developed by De la Torre etal. (Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 62, and 272) to assess the relative risk of new introductions of ASF by natural movements of WB according to the current epidemiological situation. This update incorporates the most recent available data and an improved version of the most important risk estimator: an optimized cartographic tool of WB distribution to analyse wild boar suitable habitat. The highest relative risk values were estimated for Slovakia (5) and Romania (5), followed by Finland (4), Czech Republic (3) and Germany (3). Relative risk for Romania and Finland is associated mainly with disease entrance from endemic areas such as the Russian Federation and Ukraine, where the disease is currently spreading; relative risk for Germany and Czech Republic is associated mainly with the potential progress of the disease through the EU, and relative risk for Slovakia is associated with both pathways. WB habitat is the most important risk estimator, whereas WB density is the least significant, suggesting that WB presence is more relevant than density. These results can provide actionable advice for dealing with risk. They can be directly used to inform risk-based national strategies and identify countries that may need to pay greater attention to surveillance or conduct additional evaluations at the subnational level. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided formative evaluation of the implementation of a redesigned interprofessional team rounding process. The purpose of the redesigned process was to improve health team communication about hospital discharge. Themes emerging from interviews of patients, nurses, and providers revealed the inherent value and positive characteristics of the new process, but also workflow, team hierarchy, and process challenges to successful implementation. The evaluation identified actionable recommendations for modifying the implementation process.

AB Purpose: Chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) is recognized as an actionable receptor selectively expressed by breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Reparixin is an investigational allosteric inhibitor of chemokine receptors 1 and 2 (CXCR1/2), and demonstrates activity against BCSCs in human breast cancer xenografts. This phase Ib clinical trial examined dose, safety, and pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel plus reparixin therapy, and explored effects of reparixin on BCSCs in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (trial registration ID: NCT02001974).Experimental Design: Eligible patients had MBC and were candidates for paclitaxel therapy. Study treatment included a 3-day run-in with reparixin oral tablets three times a day, followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m2/week (days 1, 8, and 15 for 28-day cycle) + reparixin tablets three times a day for 21/28 days; three dose cohorts were examined in a 3+3 dose escalation schema. Additional patients were recruited into an expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose to further explore pharmacokinetics, safety, and biological effects of the combination therapy.Results: There were neither G4-5 adverse events nor serious adverse events related to study therapy and no interactions between reparixin and paclitaxel to influence their respective pharmacokinetic profiles. A 30% response rate was recorded, with durable responses >12 months in two patients. Exploratory biomarker analysis was inconclusive for therapy effect on BCSCs.Conclusions: Weekly paclitaxel plus reparixin in MBC appeared to be safe and tolerable, with demonstrated responses in the enrolled population. Dose level 3, 1200 mg orally three times a day, was selected for further study in a randomized phase II trial (NCT02370238).

AB The essential job of precision medicine is to match the right drugs to the right patients. In cancer, precision medicine has been nearly synonymous with genomics. However, sobering recent studies have generally shown that most patients with cancer who receive genomic testing do not benefit from a genomic precision medicine strategy. Although some call the entire project of precision cancer medicine into question, I suggest instead that the tools employed must be broadened. Instead of relying exclusively on big data measurements of initial conditions, we should also acquire highly actionable functional information by perturbing-for example, with cancer therapies-viable primary tumor cells from patients with cancer.

AB Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare manifestation of hypereosinophilia and a cause of morbidity, including dysuria and hematuria. Although some cases can be attributed to infection or allergy, most cases are assessed to be idiopathic and treated with corticosteroids. However, hypereosinophilia can also be due to actionable clonal molecular alterations in the haematopoietic cells, similar to other myeloproliferative neoplasms. Common mutations associated with eosonophilic syndromes are of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha or beta or c-kit, though other pathogenic mutations have been found by next generation sequencing. Determination of a specific mutation may therefore identify clonality and refine treatment of some cases. Here we review the molecular features of eosinophilic disorders. We also describe the use of a liquid biopsy of circulating cell-free DNA in the workup of a case of eosinophilic cystitis in which next generation sequencing of cell-free DNA showed a BRAF I463T mutation. In silico modeling supports the functional impact and potential clinical relevance of BRAF I463T.

AB The current standard of care for molecular marker testing in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been evolving over several years and is a product of the quality of the evidence supporting a targeted therapy for a specific molecular marker, the pre-test probability of that marker in the population, and the magnitude of benefit seen with that treatment. Among the markers that have one or more matched targeted therapies, only a few are in the subset for which they should be considered as most clearly worthy of prioritizing to detect in the first line setting in order to have them supplant other first line alternatives, and in only a subset of patients, as defined currently by NSCLC histology. Specifically, this currently includes testing for an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 rearrangement. This article reviews the history and data supporting the prioritization of these markers in patients with non-squamous NSCLC, a histologically selected population in whom the probability of these markers combined with the anticipated efficacy of targeted therapies against them is high enough to favor these treatments in the first line setting. In reviewing the evidence supporting this very limited core subset of most valuable molecular markers to detect in the initial workup of such patients, we can also see the criteria by which other actionable markers need to reach in order to be widely recognized as reliably valuable enough to warrant prioritization to detect in the initial workup of advanced NSCLC as well.

AB The advent of targeted therapies has established new standards of care for defined molecular subsets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Not only has this led to significant changes in the routine clinical management of lung cancer e.g., multiplexed genomic testing, but it has provided important principles and benchmarks for determining "actionability". At present, the clinical paradigms are most evolved for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements, where multiple randomized phase III trials have determined optimal treatment strategies in both treatment naive and resistant settings. However, this may not always be feasible with low prevalence alterations e.g., ROS1 and BRAF mutations. Another emerging observation is that not all targets are equally "actionable", necessitating a rigorous preclinical, clinical and translational framework to prosecute new targets and drug candidates. In this review, we will cover the role of targeted therapies for NSCLC harbouring BRAF, MET, HER2 and RET alterations, all of which have shown promise in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (ns-NSCLC). We further review some early epigenetic targets in NSCLC, an area of emerging interest. With increased molecular segmentation of lung cancer, we discuss the upcoming challenges in drug development and implementation of precision oncology approaches, especially in light of the complex and rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape.

AB Numerous pharmacogenetic clinical guidelines and recommendations have been published, but barriers have hindered the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics. The Translational Pharmacogenetics Program (TPP) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pharmacogenomics Research Network was established in 2011 to catalog and contribute to the development of pharmacogenetic implementations at eight US healthcare systems, with the goal to disseminate real-world solutions for the barriers to clinical pharmacogenetic implementation. The TPP collected and normalized pharmacogenetic implementation metrics through June 2015, including gene-drug pairs implemented, interpretations of alleles and diplotypes, numbers of tests performed and actionable results, and workflow diagrams. TPP participant institutions developed diverse solutions to overcome many barriers, but the use of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines provided some consistency among the institutions. The TPP also collected some pharmacogenetic implementation outcomes (scientific, educational, financial, and informatics), which may inform healthcare systems seeking to implement their own pharmacogenetic testing programs. © 2017, The American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB BACKGROUND: Providing patient-centered health care requires that patient needs, preferences, and valued outcomes are more fully integrated into all decisions. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures provide unique information from the patient perspective on overall health, symptoms, burden, and treatment response.; OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe applications of PROs in clinical settings and considerations for implementation from the perspectives of PRO researchers, clinicians, administrators, policy makers, and patients attending a multidisciplinary meeting.; DISCUSSION: Clinical applications of PROs include individual level use for medical decision making and aggregate use for comparative effectiveness research, program evaluation, quality improvement, and performance assessments. Considerations of feasibility on workflow impact and patient burden, display of results, and administration frequency are important. PROs with strong psychometric properties, actionable thresholds, and interpretable results should be selected. We provide current exemplars of PRO use in various clinical applications, initial lessons learned, and highlight conceptual, logistical, and consequential considerations of PRO data collection. A research agenda is proposed to address critical knowledge gaps. In conclusion, PROs can be used in clinical settings to support patient-centered care. This requires an assessment of feasibility in the intended setting of use, measurement considerations, and process measures to optimize integration and use. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Given that the goal of health care systems is to improve and maintain the health of the populations they serve, the indicators of performance must include outcomes that are meaningful to patients. The growth of health technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to integrate the patient voice into clinical care by linking electronic health records (EHRs) to patient-reported outcome (PRO) data collection. However, PRO data must be relevant, meaningful, and actionable for those who will have to invest the time and effort to collect it.; OBJECTIVE: In this study, we highlight opportunities to integrate PRO data collection into EHRs. We consider how stakeholder perspectives should influence the selection of PROs and ways to enhance engagement in and commitment to PRO implementation. We propose a research and policy agenda to address unanswered questions and facilitate the widespread adoption of PRO data collection into EHRs.; DISCUSSION: Building a learning health care system that gathers PRO data in ways that can inform individual patient care, quality improvement, and comparative effectiveness research has the potential to accelerate the application of new evidence and knowledge to patient care.

AB Aim: This study aimed to examine pharmacogenomic test results and patient perspectives at an academic cardiovascular medicine clinic.; Patients & methods: Test results for three common cardiovascular drug-gene tests (warfarin-CYP2C9-VKORC1, clopidogrel-CYP2C19 and simvastatin-SLCO1B1) of 208patients in the Ohio State University-Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative were examined to determine the incidence of potentially actionable test results. A post-hoc, anonymous, patient survey was also conducted.; Results: Potentially actionable test results for at least one of the three drug-gene tests were determined in 170 (82%) patients. Survey responses (n=134) suggested that patients generally considered their test results to be important (median of 7.5 on a 10-point scale of importance) and were interested (median of 7.3 on a 10-point scale of interest) in a Clinical Pharmacogenomic Service.; Conclusion: Attitudes toward pharmacogenomic testing were generally favorable, and potentially actionable test results were not uncommon in this cardiovascular medicine cohort.

AB Targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. Widely developed over the last decade, this new concept of precision medicine relies on the use of genomic technologies to analyze tumor samples in order to identify actionable targets and biomarkers of resistance. The goal is to optimize treatment by identifying which therapeutic approach is best for each patient, i.e. the treatment that is effective, has minimal adverse effects, and avoids unnecessary intervention and cost. The purpose of this review is to highlight, using a few seminal examples of therapeutic targets, the important contribution of appropriate analysis of key oncogenes or driver genes in making clinical decisions. Cancer genomics is now an indispensable part of clinical management. Furthermore, the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) will enable exploration of more and more genes of interest, leading to new treatment options for personalized medicine.

AB The Treatment Support Measure (TSM) Parent and Youth were created to help clinicians with actionable feedback when youths are not making sufficient progress in treatment. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Dutch TSM Parent and TSM Youth. Parents (n=172) and youth (n=122) were recruited at 2 outpatient mental health care institutions. Children of participating parents (50.6% boys) had a mean age of 11.9years (SD=3.46; range 4-18). Participating youth (30.3% boys) had a mean age of 15.68years (SD=1.75; range 12-18). Participants were asked to complete the TSM and questionnaires measuring related constructs once during treatment. Responses to the TSM Parent items were explained by 9 instead of 5 subscales, and responses to the TSM Youth items were explained by 8 instead of 4 subscales. The internal consistency reliability of both the TSM Parent and the TSM Youth scales was generally good. The convergent validity of the TSM Parent and the TSM Youth was also good, although the divergent validity was less convincing. The criterion validity was inconclusive; the TSM Parent was not able to differentiate between problematic and nonproblematic treatments, but multiple scales of the TSM Youth were able to differentiate between these groups. The TSM Parent and TSM Youth have potential to be helpful tools in clinical practice. They could signal potential barriers to youth progress and direct the conversation between the clinician and youth and parents about adaptation of treatment.; KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: This is the first study to investigate the psychometric properties of the Treatment Support Measure (TSM) Parent and Youth versions, which are created to help clinicians with actionable feedback when youths are not making sufficient progress in treatment. The Dutch TSM Parent and TSM Youth have moderate to good psychometric properties. The Dutch TSM Parent and TSM Youth might be helpful tools for use in clinical practice: they contain variables that are related to youth outcome, can signal potential barriers to youth progress, and can direct the conversation between the clinician and the youth and parents about adaptation of treatment. The Dutch TSM Parent and TSM Youth could be added to the regular ROM to facilitate both routine monitoring of outcome and direct and concrete aid to the here-and-now relational processes in treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: While translational genomic sequencing research is increasing, few studies have been limited to healthy individuals; most have focused on patients with a disease or a strong family history of a disorder. The limited studies that have included healthy individuals have focused on the disclosure of medically actionable secondary results, rather than carrier status, to assess reproductive risks. To address this important gap, we conducted the NextGen study, which focuses on carrier status and medically actionable secondary findings in a population of women planning a pregnancy.; METHODS: We assessed 310 participants' motivations for receiving genome sequencing for expanded carrier screening and experiences with familial genetic conditions that may relate to study participation.; RESULTS: Most participants reported that obtaining general health information from genome sequencing was their primary motivator, even though they were recruited to join a study to learn more about carrier status. Forty-two percent of enrolled women became pregnant prior to obtaining sequencing results.; CONCLUSION: Genomic carrier testing may need to be offered to women prior to active pregnancy efforts to be useful for reproductive planning.

AB Medulloblastoma (MB), the most prevalent malignant childhood brain tumour, consists of at least 4 distinct subgroups each of which possesses a unique survival rate and response to treatment. To rapidly determine MB subgroup affiliation in a manner that would be actionable during surgery, we subjected murine xenograft tumours of two MB subgroups (SHH and Group 3) to Mass Spectrometry (MS) profiling using a handheld Picosecond InfraRed Laser (PIRL) desorption probe and interface developed by our group. This platform provides real time MS profiles of tissue based on laser desorbed lipids and small molecules with only 5-10 seconds of sampling. PIRL-MS analysis of ex vivo MB tumours offered a 98% success rate in subgroup determination, observed over 194 PIRL-MS datasets collected from 19 independent tumours (10 repetitions each) utilizing 6 different established MB cell lines. Robustness was verified by a 5%-leave-out-and-remodel test. PIRL ablated tissue material was collected on a filter paper and subjected to high resolution LC-MS to provide ion identity assignments for the m/z values that contribute most to the statistical discrimination between SHH and Group 3 MB. Based on this analysis, rapid classification of MB with PIRL-MS utilizes a variety of fatty acid chains, glycerophosphates, glycerophosphoglycerols and glycerophosphocholines rapidly extracted from the tumours. In this work, we provide evidence that 5-10 seconds of sampling from ex vivo MB tissue with PIRL-MS can allow robust tumour subgroup classification, and have identified several biomarker ions responsible for the statistical discrimination of MB Group 3 and the SHH subgroup. The existing PIRL-MS platform used herein offers capabilities for future in vivo use.

AB Background: While tumor-tissue remains the 'gold standard' for genetic analysis in cancer patients, it is challenged with the advent of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis from blood samples. Here, we broaden our previous study on the clinical validation of plasma DNA in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, by evaluating its clinical utility under standard management care.; Patients and methods: Concordance and data turnaround-time of ctDNA when compared with tumor-tissue analysis were studied in a real-time blinded prospective multicenter clinical study (n=140 metastatic colorectal patients). Results are presented according to STARD criteria and were discussed in regard with clinical outcomes of patients.; Results: Much more mutations were found by ctDNA analysis: 59%, 11.8% and 14.4% of the patients were found KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutant by ctDNA analysis instead of 44%, 8.8% and 7.2% by tumor-tissue analysis. Median tumor-tissue data turnaround-time was 16 days while 2 days for ctDNA analysis. Discordant samples analysis revealed that use of biopsy, long delay between tumor-tissue and blood collection and resection of the tumor at time of blood draw, tumor site, or type of tissue analyzed seem to affect concordance. Altogether, the clinical data with respect to the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor response (RAS status) and the prognosis (BRAF status) of those discordant patients do not appear contradictory to the mutational status as determined by plasma analysis. Lastly, we present the first distribution profile of the RAS and BRAF hotspot mutations as determined by ctDNA analysis (n=119), revealing a high proportion of patients with multiple mutations (45% of the population and up to 5 mutations) and only 24% of WT scored patients for both genes. Mutation profile as determined from ctDNA analysis with using various detection thresholds highlights the importance of the test sensitivity.; Conclusion: Our study showed that ctDNA could replace tumor-tissue analysis, and also clinical utility of ctDNA analysis by considerably reducing data turnaround time. © The Author 2017.

AB Background: Genomic profiling is increasingly incorporated into oncology research and the clinical care of cancer patients. We sought to determine physician perception and use of enterprise-scale clinical sequencing at our center, including whether testing changed management and the reasoning behind this decision-making.; Patients and methods: All physicians who consented patients to MSK-IMPACT, a next-generation hybridization capture assay, in tumor types where molecular profiling is not routinely performed were asked to complete a questionnaire for each patient. Physician determination of genomic 'actionability' was compared to an expertly curated knowledgebase of somatic variants. Reported management decisions were compared to chart review.; Results: Responses were received from 146 physicians pertaining to 1932 patients diagnosed with 1 of 49 cancer types. Physicians indicated that sequencing altered management in 21% (331/1593) of patients in need of a treatment change. Among those in whom treatment was not altered, physicians indicated the presence of an actionable alteration in 55% (805/1474), however, only 45% (362/805) of these cases had a genomic variant annotated as actionable by expert curators. Further evaluation of these patients revealed that 66% (291/443) had a variant in a gene associated with biologic but not clinical evidence of actionability or a variant of unknown significance in a gene with at least one known actionable alteration. Of the cases annotated as actionable by experts, physicians identified an actionable alteration in 81% (362/445). In total, 13% (245/1932) of patients were enrolled to a genomically matched trial.; Conclusion: Although physician and expert assessment differed, clinicians demonstrate substantial awareness of the genes associated with potential actionability and report using this knowledge to inform management in one in five patients.; Clinical Trial number: NCT01775072. © The Author 2017.

AB Chromatin packaging of DNA provides a framework for transcriptional regulation. Modifications to DNA and histone proteins in nucleosomes lead to conformational changes, alterations in the recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and ultimately modulation of gene expression. We provide a focused review of control mechanisms that help modulate the activation and deactivation of gene transcription specifically through histone acetylation writers and readers in cancer. The chemistry of these modifications is subject to clinically actionable targeting, including state-of-the-art strategies to inhibit basic oncogenic mechanisms related to histone acetylation. Although discussed in the context of acute leukemia, the concepts of acetylation writers and readers are not cell-type-specific and are generalizable to other cancers. We review the challenges and resistance mechanisms encountered to date in the development of such therapeutics and postulate how such challenges may be overcome. Because these fundamental cellular mechanisms are dysregulated in cancer biology, continued research and in-depth understanding of histone acetylation reading and writing are desired to further define optimal therapeutic strategies to affect gene activity to target cancer effectively.

AB The objective of this review is to explain the science of metabolomics-a science of systems biology that measures and studies endogenous small molecules (metabolites) that are present in a single biological sample-and its application to the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. In addition, we discuss how discovery through metabolomics can contribute to the development of precision medicine targets for this complex disease state and the potential avenues for those new discoveries to be applied in the clinical environment. A nonsystematic literature review was performed focusing on metabolomics, pharmacometabolomics, and sepsis. Human (adult and pediatric) and animal studies were included. Metabolomics has been investigated in the diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification of sepsis, as well as for the identification of drug target opportunities. Metabolomics elucidates a new level of detail when compared with other systems biology sciences, with regard to the metabolites that are most relevant in the pathophysiology of sepsis, as well as highlighting specific biochemical pathways at work in sepsis. Metabolomics also highlights biochemical differences between sepsis survivors and nonsurvivors at a level of detail greater than that demonstrated by genomics, transcriptomics, or proteomics, potentially leading to actionable targets for new therapies. The application of pharmacometabolomics and its integration with other systems pharmacology to sepsis therapeutics could be particularly helpful in differentiating drug responders and nonresponders and furthering knowledge of mechanisms of drug action and response. The accumulated literature on metabolomics suggests it is a viable tool for continued discovery around the pathophysiology, diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment of sepsis in both adults and children, and it provides a greater level of biochemical detail and insight than other systems biology approaches. However, the clinical application of metabolomics in sepsis has not yet been fully realized. Prospective validation studies are needed to translate metabolites from the discovery phase into the clinical utility phase. © 2017 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

AB INTRODUCTION: Moffitt Cancer Center's Personalized Medicine Clinical Service (PMCS) reviews somatic next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay results, provides interpretations, and identifies potential therapeutic options. The number of individuals reviewed by our clinical service who are eligible for on-label or off-label drug therapy based on genetic test results has previously not been quantitated. We determined the number of patients harboring an actionable mutation that would qualify a patient for an on-label drug or consideration for off-label drug treatment.; METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling was utilized to identify anticancer agents containing genomic markers in the Indications and Usage section of the drug label. A database containing discrete NGS patient data was queried retrospectively for those drugs and associated genomic mutations included in this study. On-label was defined as those patients who were eligible for a drug based on harboring a targetable mutation in the FDA-approved cancer type. Off-label was defined as those patients who may be considered for a drug based on harboring a targetable mutation in a non-FDA-approved cancer type.; RESULTS: A total of 1072 patients and 1131 NGS results were eligible for study inclusion. Fifty-two patients (4.9%) had results for more than one NGS assay. Seventeen drugs targeting ALK, BRAF, BRCA1/BRCA2, EGFR, or ERBB2 mutations met the study inclusion criteria. Of the entire patient population, 92 (8.6%) unique patients were eligible for at least one on-label drug; off-label use of at least one drug could be considered in 103 (9.6%) unique patients.; CONCLUSION: Combining both on-label and off-label opportunities, 175 (16.3%) unique patients had actionable mutations in six genes. Because most patients reviewed by our PMCS have previously treated advanced disease with limited treatment options, identifying additional lines of therapy is of clinical utility. © 2017 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: With a conservatively estimated 1 million cases of leptospirosis worldwide and a 5-10% fatality rate, the rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis leading to effective clinical and public health decision making is of high importance, and yet remains a challenge.; METHODOLOGY: Based on parallel, population-based studies in two leptospirosis-endemic regions in Brazil, a real-time PCR assay which detects lipL32, a gene specifically present in pathogenic Leptospira, was assessed for the diagnostic effectiveness and accuracy. Patients identified by active hospital-based surveillance in Salvador and Curitiba during large urban leptospirosis epidemics were tested. Real-time PCR reactions were performed with DNA-extracted samples obtained from 127 confirmed and 23 unconfirmed cases suspected of leptospirosis, 122 patients with an acute febrile illness other than leptospirosis, and 60 healthy blood donors.; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The PCR assay had a limit of detection of 280 Leptospira genomic equivalents/mL. Sensitivity for confirmed cases was 61% for whole blood and 29% for serum samples. Sensitivity was higher (86%) for samples collected within the first 6 days after onset of illness compared to those collected after 7 days (34%). The real-time PCR assay was able to detect leptospiral DNA in blood from 56% of serological non-confirmed cases. The overall specificity of the assay was 99%.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that real-time PCR may be a reliable tool for early diagnosis of leptospirosis, which is decisive for clinical management of severe and life-threatening cases and for public health decision making.

AB A large number of ST-elevation notifications are generated by cardiac monitoring systems, but only a fraction of them is related to the critical condition known as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in which the blockage of coronary artery causes ST-segment elevation. Confounders such as acute pericarditis and benign early repolarization create electrocardiographic patterns mimicking STEMI but usually do not benefit from a real-time notification. A STEMI screening algorithm able to recognize those confounders utilizing capabilities of diagnostic ECG algorithms in variation analysis of ST segments helps to avoid triggering a non-actionable ST-elevation notification. However, diagnostic algorithms are generally designed to analyze short ECG snapshots collected in low-noise resting position and hence are susceptible to high levels of noise common in a monitoring environment. We developed a STEMI screening algorithm which performs a real-time signal quality evaluation on the ECG waveform to select the segments with quality high enough for subsequent analysis by a diagnostic ECG algorithm. The STEMI notifications generated by this multi-stage STEMI screening algorithm are significantly fewer than ST-elevation notifications generated by a continuous ST monitoring strategy.

AB Choroidal metastasis is rare in cancer patients and it may cause visual disturbances that reduce their quality of life. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), targeted therapy against actionable driver mutations has gradually replaced radiotherapy as the treatment of choice for choroidal metastasis. Recently, there have been several case reports of choroidal metastasis in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged NSCLC. We herein report the case of a 40-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with choroidal metastasis of an ALK-rearranged NSCLC who received alectinib as the first-line chemotherapy. Alectinib may be the best treatment for choroidal metastasis in patients harboring an ALK translocation because of its favorable side effect profile involving visual disturbances.

AB Purpose: Genomic alterations in blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) were ascertained and correlated with clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes.Experimental Design: Comprehensive plasma ctDNA testing was performed in 88 consecutive patients; 34 also had tissue next-generation sequencing; 29, other forms of genotyping; and 25 (28.4%) had no tissue molecular tests because of inadequate tissue or biopsy contraindications.Results: Seventy-two patients (82%) had ≥1 ctDNA alteration(s); among these, 75% carried alteration(s) potentially actionable by FDA-approved (61.1%) or experimental drug(s) in clinical trials (additional 13.9%). The most frequent alterations were in the TP53 (44.3% of patients), EGFR (27.3%), MET (14.8%), KRAS (13.6%), and ALK (6.8%) genes. The concordance rate for EGFR alterations was 80.8% (100% vs. 61.5%; ≤1 vs. >1 month between ctDNA and tissue tests; P = 0.04) for patients with any detectable ctDNA alterations. Twenty-five patients (28.4%) received therapy matching ≥1 ctDNA alteration(s); 72.3% (N = 16/22) of the evaluable matched patients achieved stable disease ≥6 months (SD) or partial response (PR). Five patients with ctDNA-detected EGFR T790M were subsequently treated with a third generation EGFR inhibitor; all five achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR. Patients with ≥1 alteration with ≥5% variant allele fraction (vs. < 5%) had a significantly shorter median survival (P = 0.012).Conclusions: ctDNA analysis detected alterations in the majority of patients, with potentially targetable aberrations found at expected frequencies. Therapy matched to ctDNA alterations demonstrated appreciable therapeutic efficacy, suggesting clinical utility that warrants future prospective studies.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support (CDS) tools-with easily understood and actionable information, at the point of care-are needed to help registered nurses (RNs) make evidence-based decisions. Not clear are the optimal formats of CDS tools. Thorough, preclinical testing is desirable to avoid costly errors associated with premature implementation in electronic health records.; OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to determine feasibility of the protocol designed to compare multiple CDS formats and evaluate effects of numeracy and graph literacy on RN adoption of best practices and care planning time in a simulated environment.; METHODS: In this pilot study, 60 RNs were randomly assigned to one of four CDS conditions (control, text, text + graph, and text + table) and asked to adjust the plan of care for two patient scenarios over three shifts. Fourteen best practices were identified for the two patients and sent as suggestions with evidence to the three CDS groups. Best practice adoption rates, care planning time, and their relationship to the RN's numeracy and graph literacy scores were assessed.; RESULTS: CDS groups had a higher adoption rate of best practices (p < .001) across all shifts and decreased care planning time in shifts 2 (p = .01) and 3 (p = .02) compared with the control group. Higher numeracy and graph literacy were associated with shorter care planning times under text + table (p = .05) and text + graph (p = .01) conditions. No significant differences were found between the three CDS groups on adoption rate and care planning time.; DISCUSSION: This pilot study shows the feasibility of our protocol. Findings show preliminary evidence that CDS improves the efficiency and effectiveness of care planning decisions and that the optimal format may depend on individual RN characteristics. We recommend a study with sufficient power to compare different CDS formats and assess the impact of potential covariates on adoption rates and care planning time.

AB INTRODUCTION: There is a growing emphasis on including patients' perspectives on outcomes as a measure of quality care. To date, this has been challenging in the emergency department (ED) setting. To better understand the root of this challenge, we looked to ED physicians' perspectives on their role, relationships and responsibilities to inform future development and implementation of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).; METHODS: ED physicians from hospitals across Canada were invited to participate in interviews using a snowballing sampling technique. Semistructured interviews were conducted by phone with questions focused on the role and practice of ED physicians, their relationship with their patients and their thoughts on patient-reported feedback as a mechanism for quality improvement. Transcripts were analysed using a modified constant comparative method and interpretive descriptive framework.; RESULTS: Interviews were completed with 30 individual physicians. Respondents were diverse in location, training and years in practice. Physicians reported being interested in 'objective' postdischarge information including adverse events, readmissions, other physicians' notes, etc in a select group of complex patients, but saw 'patient-reported' feedback as less valuable due to perceived biases. They were unsure about the impact of such feedback mainly because of the episodic nature of their work. Concerns about timing, as well as about their legal and ethical responsibilities to follow-up if poor patient outcomes are reported, were raised.; CONCLUSIONS: Data collection and feedback are key elements of a learning health system. While patient-reported outcomes may have a role in feedback, ED physicians are conflicted about the actionability of such data and ethical implications, given the inherently episodic nature of their work. These findings have important implications for PROM design and implementation in this unique clinical setting. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB The pathologic interpretation of gut biopsies in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients to assess graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is well accepted and supplements clinical and endoscopic findings. However, the histologic activity grading of GVHD is controversial, with attempts to predict prognosis or response to treatment largely unsuccessful. GVHD is being diagnosed earlier in its course, raising the possibility that the pathologic grading system can be profitably modified. We developed a histologic activity grading system designed to replace the commonly used modified Lerner grading systems. Our system stratifies the low-level Lerner grade I category into 4 activity grade categories, based on the average frequency of apoptotic cells. The results are expressed as ordinal categories: GVHD of minimal, mild, moderate, severe histologic activity, or severe histologic activity with destruction (activity grades 1 to 5). In a retrospective study, we studied 87 consecutive cases with 201 post-transplantation specimens (median, 48 days; range, 18 to 1479 days) of stomach, duodenum, and colorectum, which had been activity graded at the time of the original diagnosis. Most of the biopsies diagnosed as GVHD were low grade-minimal (11%) or mild (71%) histologic activity. We hypothesized that the higher activity grades would be associated with more therapeutic intervention. The odds of increased therapy in the combined all-site specimens were increased as activity grade increased (odds ratio,2.9 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.9 to 4.5]; P=<.0001). Thus, our grading system was validated. To investigate whether the activity grade was associated with therapy within the formerly undivided Lerner grade I category, the analysis was restricted to these 174 all-site specimens. The validation result was similar (odds ratio,3.1 [95% CI, 1.3 to 7.2]; P=.009). This result interestingly suggests that there is useful information hidden in the Lerner grade I category, which could potentially guide immediately actionable treatment decisions. This histologic activity grade system has been in use at our institution for over 2 years with good acceptance. Copyright © 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

AB The primary goals of environmental monitoring are to indicate whether unexpected changes related to development are occurring in the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of ecosystems and to inform meaningful management intervention. Although achieving these objectives is conceptually simple, varying scientific and social challenges often result in their breakdown. Conceptualizing, designing, and operating programs that better delineate monitoring, management, and risk assessment processes supported by hypothesis-driven approaches, strong inference, and adverse outcome pathways can overcome many of the challenges. Generally, a robust monitoring program is characterized by hypothesis-driven questions associated with potential adverse outcomes and feedback loops informed by data. Specifically, key and basic features are predictions of future observations (triggers) and mechanisms to respond to success or failure of those predictions (tiers). The adaptive processes accelerate or decelerate the effort to highlight and overcome ignorance while preventing the potentially unnecessary escalation of unguided monitoring and management. The deployment of the mutually reinforcing components can allow for more meaningful and actionable monitoring programs that better associate activities with consequences.

AB BACKGROUND: Trauma patients often present with injuries requiring resuscitation and further evaluation. Many providers advocate for whole body computed tomography (WBCT) for rapid and comprehensive diagnosis of life-threatening injuries.; OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the literature concerning mortality effect, emergency department (ED) length of stay, radiation, and incidental findings associated with WBCT.; DISCUSSION: Physicians have historically relied upon history and physical examination to diagnose life-threatening injuries in trauma. Diagnostic imaging modalities including radiographs, ultrasound, and computed tomography have demonstrated utility in injury detection. Many centers routinely utilize WBCT based on the premise this test will improve mortality. However, WBCT may increase radiation and incidental findings when used without considering pre-test probability of actionable traumatic injuries. Studies supporting WBCT are predominantly retrospective and incorporate trauma scoring systems, which have significant design weaknesses. The recent REACT-2 trial randomized trauma patients with high index of suspicion for actionable injuries to WBCT versus selective imaging and found no mortality difference. Additional prospective trials evaluating WBCT in specific trauma subgroups (e.g. polytrauma) are needed to evaluate benefit. In the interim, the available data suggests clinicians should adopt a selective imaging strategy driven by history and physical examination.; CONCLUSIONS: While observational data suggests an association between WBCT and a benefit in mortality and ED length of stay, randomized controlled data suggests no mortality benefit to this diagnostic tool. The literature would benefit from confirmatory studies of the use of WBCT in trauma sub-groups to clarify its impact on mortality for patients with specific injury patterns.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose was to critique existing parenting apps using established criteria and health literacy guidelines.; STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive methodology was used.; METHODS: The Apple App Store was searched using the terms parenting, child health, and infant health. To be included, the apps had to have relevant content (parenting, child health, or infant health), be in English, and contain parent education. After eliminating apps that failed to meet inclusion criteria from the original 203 apps, 46 apps were reviewed. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the health literacy subscales called Understandability and Actionability. Content analysis included Authority, Objectivity, Accuracy, Timeliness, and Usability.; RESULTS: The majority of the apps (70%) were in English only. The price ranged from free to $4.99. The purpose, target audience, and topics varied. Although all included apps were for parents, some were for more targeted groups of parents. The source of the information was not presented in 26% of the apps. Most apps took the user to a Web site or an article to read. Functionality of the apps was limited, with none of them providing a customized experience.; CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Much development and research is needed before mobile health (mHealth) solutions can be recommended by nurses caring for new parents. It is critical that consumers and interdisciplinary professionals be involved in the early design phase of the product to ensure that the end product is acceptable and usable and that it will lead to healthy behaviors.

AB Identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) remain rate limiting steps in producing actionable data for clinical care of bloodstream infections. Rapid, automated phenotypic ID and AST by fluorescent in situ hybridization and automated microscopy were used to characterize blood stream infections in a predominantly pediatric oncology patient population. Results were compared to standard of care (SOC) phenotypic methods. The Accelerate Pheno System (AXDX) had a sensitivity of 91.2% and an accuracy of 100% to the genus level for identification, and an overall categorical agreement 91.2-91.8% for susceptibility, depending on the breakpoints used. The AXDX required a mean time of 1.4hours for identification and 6.6hours for susceptibility testing compared to SOC, requiring 32.5 and 46.7hours, respectively. Identification and susceptibility by rapid phenotypic methods shows a high degree of accuracy; the marked reduction in time to results may have significant implications for patient care.

AB AIMS: Low-grade ovarian endometrioid carcinomas may be associated with high-grade components. Whether the latter are clonally related to and originate from the low-grade endometrioid carcinoma remains unclear. The aim of this study was to use massively parallel sequencing to characterize the genomic landscape and clonal relatedness of an ovarian endometrioid carcinoma containing low-grade and high-grade components.; METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA samples extracted from each tumour component (low-grade endometrioid, high-grade anaplastic and high-grade squamous) and matched normal tissue were subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing with the 410-gene Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) sequencing assay. Somatic single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and copy number alterations were detected with state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms, and validated with orthogonal methods. The endometrioid carcinoma and the associated high-grade components shared copy number alterations and four clonal mutations, including SMARCA4 mutations, which resulted in loss of BRG1 protein expression. Subclonal mutations and mutations restricted to single components were also identified, such as distinct TP53 mutations restricted to each histological component.; CONCLUSIONS: Histologically distinct components of ovarian endometrioid carcinomas may show intratumour genetic heterogeneity but be clonally related, harbouring a complex clonal composition. In the present case, SMARCA4 mutations were probably early events, whereas TP53 somatic mutations were acquired later in evolution. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB User-generated information on the Internet provides opportunities for the monitoring of health information consumer attitudes. For example, information about cancer prevention may cause decisional conflict. Yet posts and conversations shared by health information consumers online are often not readily actionable for interpretation and decision-making due to their unstandardized format. This study extends prior research on the use of natural language as a predictor of consumer attitudes and provides a link to decision-making by evaluating the predictive role of uncertainty indicators expressed in natural language. Analyzed data included free-text comments and structured scale responses related to information about skin cancer prevention options. The study identified natural language indicators of uncertainty and showed that it can serve as a predictor of decisional conflict. The natural indicators of uncertainty reported here can facilitate the monitoring of health consumer perceptions about cancer prevention recommendations and inform education and communication campaign planning and evaluation.

AB The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program (Tracking Program) is a multidisciplinary collaboration that involves the ongoing collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data from environmental hazard monitoring, human exposure surveillance, and health effects surveillance. With a renewed focus on data-driven decision-making, the CDC's Tracking Program emphasizes dissemination of actionable data to public health practitioners, policy makers, and communities. The CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network), a Web-based system with components at the national, state, and local levels, houses environmental public health data used to inform public health actions (PHAs) to improve community health. This article serves as a detailed landscape on the Tracking Program and Tracking Network and the Tracking Program's leading performance measure, "public health actions." Tracking PHAs are qualitative statements addressing a local problem or situation, the role of the state or local Tracking Program, how the problem or situation was addressed, and the action taken. More than 400 PHAs have been reported by funded state and local health departments since the Tracking Program began collecting PHAs in 2005. Three case studies are provided to illustrate the use of the Tracking Program resources and data on the Tracking Network, and the diversity of actions taken. Through a collaborative network of experts, data, and tools, the Tracking Program and its Tracking Network are actively informing state and local PHAs. In a time of competing priorities and limited funding, PHAs can serve as a powerful tool to advance environmental public health practice.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to use the NSQIP database to determine the national rate and predictors of free flap failure based upon flap sites and flap types.; METHODS: Free flaps were identified using the 2005-2010 NSQIP database. We examined overall flap failure rates as well as failure rates based upon flap sites (head and neck, extremities, trunk, and breast) and flap types (muscle, fascial, skin, bone, and bowel flaps). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine predictors of flap failure.; RESULTS: There were 1,187 microvascular free tissue transfers identified. The overall flap failure rate was 5.1%. Head and neck flaps had the highest rate of free flap failure at 7.7%. Prolonged operative time is an independent predictor of flap failure for all free flaps (OR: 2.383, P=0.0013). When examining predictors of failure by flap site, free flaps to the breast with prolonged operative time are independently associated with flap failure (OR: 2.288, P=0.0152). When examining predictors of flap failure by flap type, muscle based free flaps with an ASA classification ≥3 are associated with flap failure (P=0.0441).; CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for free flap failure differ based upon flap site and flap type. Prolonged operative time is an independent risk factor for the failure of free flaps used for breast reconstruction. An ASA classification ≥3 is associated with the failure of free muscle based flaps. Our findings identify actionable areas that may help to improve free flap success. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: To provide its participants with an external quality assessment system (EQAS) that can be used to check trueness, the Dutch EQAS organizer, Organization for Quality Assessment of Laboratory Diagnostics (SKML), has innovated its general chemistry scheme over the last decade by introducing fresh frozen commutable samples whose values were assigned by Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM)-listed reference laboratories using reference methods where possible. Here we present some important innovations in our feedback reports that allow participants to judge whether their trueness and imprecision meet predefined analytical performance specifications.; METHODS: Sigma metrics are used to calculate performance indicators named 'sigma values'. Tolerance intervals are based on both Total Error allowable (TEa) according to biological variation data and state of the art (SA) in line with the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) Milan consensus.; RESULTS: The existing SKML feedback reports that express trueness as the agreement between the regression line through the results of the last 12 months and the values obtained from reference laboratories and calculate imprecision from the residuals of the regression line are now enriched with sigma values calculated from the degree to which the combination of trueness and imprecision are within tolerance limits. The information and its conclusion to a simple two-point scoring system are also graphically represented in addition to the existing difference plot.; CONCLUSIONS: By adding sigma metrics-based performance evaluation in relation to both TEa and SA tolerance intervals to its EQAS schemes, SKML provides its participants with a powerful and actionable check on accuracy.

AB BACKGROUND: With rapid advances in genomic medicine, the complexity of delivering precision medicine to oncology patients across a university health system demanded the creation of a Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) for patient selection and assessment of treatment options. The objective of this report is to analyze our progress to date and discuss the importance of the MTB in the implementation of personalized medicine.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were reviewed in the MTB for appropriateness for comprehensive next generation sequencing (NGS) cancer gene set testing based on set criteria that were in place. Because profiling of stage IV lung cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma cancers were standard of care, these cancer types were excluded from this process. We subsequently analyzed the types of cases referred for testing and approved with regards to their results.; RESULTS: 191 cases were discussed at the MTB and 132 cases were approved for testing. Forty-six cases (34.8%) had driver mutations that were associated with an active targeted therapeutic agent, including BRAF, PIK3CA, IDH1, KRAS, and BRCA1. An additional 56 cases (42.4%) had driver mutations previously reported in some type of cancer. Twenty-two cases (16.7%) did not have any clinically significant mutations. Eight cases did not yield adequate DNA. 15 cases were considered for targeted therapy, 13 of which received targeted therapy. One patient experienced a near complete response. Seven of 13 had stable disease or a partial response.; CONCLUSIONS: MTB at University of Alabama-Birmingham is unique because it reviews the appropriateness of NGS testing for patients with recurrent cancer and serves as a forum to educate our physicians about the pathways of precision medicine. Our results suggest that our detection of actionable mutations may be higher due to our careful selection. The application of precision medicine and molecular genetic testing for cancer patients remains a continuous educational process for physicians.

AB BACKGROUND: Screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation may lead to treatment with oral anticoagulation therapy, which can decrease the risk of ischemic stroke. The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of the Program for the Identification of 'Actionable' Atrial Fibrillation in the Pharmacy Setting (PIAAF-Pharmacy), which screened 1145 participants aged 65 years or more at 30 community pharmacies in Ontario and Alberta between October 2014 and April 2015.; METHODS: We used a 2-part decision model to evaluate the short- and long-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of a pharmacy screening program for atrial fibrillation compared to no screening. Data from the PIAAF-Pharmacy study were used for the short-term model, and the relevant literature was used to extrapolate the benefits of the PIAAF-Pharmacy study in the long-term model. Costs and QALYs were calculated from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 1.5%/year.; RESULTS: Screening for atrial fibrillation in pharmacies was associated with higher costs ($26) and more QALYs (0.0035) compared to no screening, yielding an incremental cost per QALY gained of $7480. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed that screening for atrial fibrillation in a pharmacy setting was a cost-effective strategy.; INTERPRETATION: Our results support screening for atrial fibrillation in Canadian pharmacies. Given this finding, efforts should be made by provincial governments and pharmacies to implement such programs in Canada. The addition of atrial fibrillation screening alongside screening and management of other cardiovascular conditions may help to reduce the burden of stroke.

AB Penile cancer (PeCa) is a rare malignancy with potentially devastating effects. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common variant with distinct precancerous lesions before development into invasive disease. Involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor in PeCa, and once disease is present outside the groin, prognosis is poor. Metastatic PeCa is challenging to treat and often requires multidisciplinary approaches in management. Due to its rarity, molecular understanding of the disease continues to be limited with most studies based on small, single center series. Thus far, it appears PeCa has diverse mechanisms of carcinogenesis affecting similar molecular pathways. In this review, we evaluate the current landscape of the molecular carcinogenesis of PeCa and explore ongoing research on potential actionable targets of therapy. The emergence of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other immunotherapeutic strategies may improve outcomes for PeCa patients.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infections are highly morbid, common, and costly, and rates are increasing (Sohail et al. Arch Intern Med 171(20):1821-8 2011; Voigt et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 48(3):590-1 2006). Factors that contribute to the development of CIED infections include patient factors (comorbid conditions, self-care, microbiome), procedural details (repeat procedure, contamination during procedure, appropriate pre-procedural prep, and antimicrobial use), environmental and organizational factors (patient safety culture, facility barriers, such as lack of space to store essential supplies, quality of environmental cleaning), and microbial factors (type of organism, virulence of organism). Each of these can be specifically targeted with infection prevention interventions.; RECENT FINDINGS: Basic prevention practices, such as administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to incision and delaying the procedure in the setting of fever or elevated INR, are helpful for day-to-day prevention of cardiac device infections. Small single-center studies provide proof-of-concept that bundled prevention interventions can reduce infections, particularly in outbreak settings. However, data regarding which prevention strategies are the most important is limited as are data regarding the optimal prevention program for day-to-day prevention (Borer et al. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 25(6):492-7 2004; Ahsan et al. Europace 16(10):1482-9 2014). Evolution of infection prevention programs to include ambulatory and procedural areas is crucial as healthcare delivery is increasingly provided outside of hospitals and operating rooms. The focus on traditional operating rooms and inpatient care leaves the vast majority of healthcare delivery-including cardiac device implantations in the electrophysiology laboratory-uncovered.

AB In pursuit of establishing a realistic metabolic phenotypic space, the reversibility of reactions is thermodynamically constrained in modern metabolic networks. The reversibility constraints follow from heuristic thermodynamic poise approximations that take anticipated cellular metabolite concentration ranges into account. Because constraints reduce the feasible space, draft metabolic network reconstructions may need more extensive reconciliation, and a larger number of genes may become essential. Notwithstanding ubiquitous application, the effect of reversibility constraints on the predictive capabilities of metabolic networks has not been investigated in detail. Instead, work has focused on the implementation and validation of the thermodynamic poise calculation itself. With the advance of fast linear programming-based network reconciliation, the effects of reversibility constraints on network reconciliation and gene essentiality predictions have become feasible and are the subject of this study. Networks with thermodynamically informed reversibility constraints outperformed gene essentiality predictions compared to networks that were constrained with randomly shuffled constraints. Unconstrained networks predicted gene essentiality as accurately as thermodynamically constrained networks, but predicted substantially fewer essential genes. Networks that were reconciled with sequence similarity data and strongly enforced reversibility constraints outperformed all other networks. We conclude that metabolic network analysis confirmed the validity of the thermodynamic constraints, and that thermodynamic poise information is actionable during network reconciliation.

AB OBJECTIVES: The increase in patient safety reporting systems has led to the challenge of effectively analyzing these data to identify and mitigate safety hazards. Patient safety analysts, who manage reports, may be ill-equipped to make sense of report data. We sought to understand the cognitive needs of patient safety analysts as they work to leverage patient safety reports to mitigate risk and improve patient care.; METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 analysts, from 11 hospitals across 3 healthcare systems. Data were parsed into utterances and coded to extract major themes.; RESULTS: From 21 interviews, 516 unique utterances were identified and categorized into the following 4 stages of data analysis: input (15.1% of utterances), transformation (14.1%), extrapolation (30%), and output (14%). Input utterances centered on the source (35.9% of inputs) and preprocessing of data. Transformation utterances centered on recategorizing patient safety events (57.5% of transformations) or integrating external data sources (42.5% of transformations). The focus of interviews was on extrapolation and trending data (56.1% of extrapolations); alarmingly, 16.1% of trend utterances explicitly mentioned a reliance on memory. The output was either a report (56.9% of outputs) or an action (43.1% of outputs).; CONCLUSIONS: Major gaps in the analysis of patient safety report data were identified. Despite software to support reporting, many reports come from other sources. Transforming data are burdensome because of recategorization of events and integration with other data sources, processes that can be automated. Surprisingly, trend identification was mostly based on patient analyst memory, highlighting a need for new tools that better support analysts.

AB INTRODUCTION: Suboptimal screening for diabetic eye disease is a major cause of preventable vision loss. Screening barriers include mydriasis and the extra time patients need to attend dedicated eye screening appointments. In the Clearsight trial, we are testing whether screening by non-mydriatic ultra-wide field (NM UWF) imaging on the day patients attend their diabetes outpatient clinic visit improves detection of clinically important eye disease compared with usual screening.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients with diabetes due for a screening eye exam by the 2013 Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) practice guidelines are being randomised to on-site screening by NM UWF imaging on the day of their clinic visit or to usual screening where, per CDA guidelines, they are encouraged to arrange an exam by an optometrist. The primary outcome is actionable eye disease (AED) based on a need for referral to ophthalmology and/or increased ocular surveillance. The primary analysis will use an intention-to-screen approach that compares the proportions of detected AED between on-site and usual screening groups under a superiority hypothesis in favour of on-site screening. With 740 randomised participants, the study will have 80% power to detect ≥5%absolute increase in the AED rate among on-site screening versus usual screening participants. This difference translates into a number-needed-to-screen by on-site screening of 20 to detect 1 additional person with AED.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Western University. The findings of the trial will be disseminated directly to participants and through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT02579837 (registered 16 October 2015).; PROTOCOL ISSUE DATE: 18 November 2015. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality conference is a common educational and quality improvement activity performed in cardiac catheterization laboratories, but best practices for case selection and for maximizing the effectiveness of peer review have not been determined.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the 10-year percutaneous coronary intervention morbidity and mortality conference experience of an academic medical center. Cases were triggered for review by the occurrence of prespecified procedural events. Summary reports from morbidity and mortality conference discussions were linked to clinical data from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease to compare baseline and procedural characteristics and to assess postdischarge outcomes. Of 11786 procedures, from 2004 to 2013, 157 (1.3%) were triggered for review. The most frequent triggering events were cardioversion/defibrillation (72, 0.6%), unplanned use of mechanical circulatory support (64, 0.5%), and major dissection (41, 0.3%). Selected procedures were more likely to include high-risk features, such as ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and multivessel disease, and were associated with higher mortality at 30 days. Only a minority of triggering events were caused by controversial or unacceptable physician behavior.; CONCLUSIONS: This 10-year experience outlines the processes for conduct of an effective percutaneous coronary intervention morbidity and mortality conference, including a novel approach to case selection and structured peer review leading to actionable quality interventions. The prespecified clinical triggers, captured in the natural workflow by laboratory staff, identified complex cases that were associated with poor patient outcomes. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB AIMS: Data on the clinical impact of gender in "real-life" patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), receiving clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor are limited. We aimed to investigate sex-based differences in clinical outcome of those patients.; METHODS: In a prospective, observational, multicenter, cohort study, 2047 patients were recruited into the GReekAntiPlatElet (GRAPE) Registry and were followed up until 1year for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, and stroke) and bleeding events (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] classification).; RESULTS: Women (n=360, 17.6%) were more frequently administered clopidogrel (rather than novel P2Y12 receptor antagonists) at PCI hospital and at discharge. MACE occurred in 9.2% and 8.1% of women and men, respectively and did not differ significantly by gender. Rate of observed bleeding BARC any type was 57.2% and 44.4% in women and men, respectively. Following adjustment, only differences in BARC any type and BARC type 1 events remained significant, with higher rates observed between women: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.51 (1.23-1.85) and 1.58 (1.27-1.96), respectively, P<.001 for both.; CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary "real-life" cohort of patients with ACS treated with PCI and focusing on antiplatelet treatment 1-year ischemic outcome does not differ by gender, while women do present more frequently not actionable bleeding events. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Cancer precision medicine requires clinically actionable biomarkers for patient stratification and a better prediction of clinical outcome. Although thousands of cancer-enriched mutated genes have been reported by global sequencing projects, to date, only a few oncogenic mutations have been confirmed as effective biomarkers in cancer therapies. The low frequency and varied profile (i.e., allele frequency, mutation position) of mutant genes among cancer types limit the utility of predictive biomarkers. The recent explosion of cancer transcriptome and phenotypic screening data provides another opportunity for finding transcript-level biomarkers and targets, thus overcoming the limitation of cancer mutation analyses. Technological developments enable the rapid and extensive discovery of potential target-biomarker combinations from large-scale transcriptome-level screening combined with physiologically relevant phenotypic assays. Here, we summarized recent progress as well as discussed the outlook of transcriptome-oriented data mining strategies and phenotypic assays for the identification of non-genetic biomarkers and targets in cancer drug discovery.

AB Objective. To determine whether admissions data alone adequately predicts student success in the first-year doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) curriculum or whether academic monitoring and intervention has greater value toward successful completion of first-year coursework. Methods. A systematic evaluation of the literature assessing student success was performed to ascertain historical evidence of student success metrics. We then retrospectively analyzed internal admissions data and first-year outcomes for our pharmacy classes of 2016-2019 using available data. We conducted an interim evaluation of voluntary academic monitoring and mentoring with the hypothesis that admission data alone cannot predict student success in early foundational coursework, and intentional intervention might improve success. Results. Pre-pharmacy grade point average (GPA), science GPA, Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) score, and prior degree status each retain some predictive value regarding success, and combinations of these factors may improve the ability to predict student success in early foundational coursework. There remains a significant, and perhaps insurmountable, gap in identifying quantitative metrics that forecast student success. Although admission data can stratify incoming students based on predicted academic ability, early monitoring and intervention provide an actionable means for enhancing student success in first-year coursework. Conclusion. Quantitative academic measures, such as PCAT scores and GPA, historically have demonstrated limited value in predicting student success. While these measures allow stratification of predicted academic performance among incoming students, monitoring of first-year, institution-specific data, such as midterm grades, can direct intentional intervention and remediation strategies that may provide more benefit to ensure students succeed.

AB Background: Never-smokers and never-drinkers patients (NSND) suffering from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are epidemiologically different from smokers drinkers (SD). We therefore hypothesized that they harbored distinct targetable molecular alterations.; Patients and methods: Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (discovery set), Gene Expression Omnibus and Centre Leon Berard (CLB) (three validation sets) with available gene expression profiles of HPV-negative OSCC from NSND and SD were mined. Protein expression profiles and genomic alterations were also analyzed from TCGA, and a functional pathway enrichment analysis was carried out. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from 44 OSCC including 20 NSND and 24 SD treated at CLB were retrospectively collected to perform targeted-sequencing of 2559 transcripts (HTG EdgeSeq system), and CD3, CD4, CD8, IDO1, and PD-L1 expression analyses by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Enrichment of a six-gene interferon-gamma signature of clinical response to pembrozulimab (PD-1 inhibitor) was evaluated in each sample from all cohorts, using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis method.; Results: A total of 854 genes and 29 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between NSND and SD in TCGA. Functional pathway analysis highlighted an overall enrichment for immune-related pathways in OSCC from NSND, especially involving T-cell activation. Interferon-gamma response and PD1 signaling were strongly enriched in NSND. IDO1 and PD-L1 were overexpressed and the score of response to pembrolizumab was higher in NSND than in SD, although the mutational load was lower in NSND. IHC analyses in the CLB cohort evidenced IDO1 and PD-L1 overexpression in tumor cells that was associated with a higher rate of tumor-infiltrating T-cells in NSND compared with SD.; Conclusion: The main biological and actionable difference between OSCC from NSND and SD lies in the immune microenvironment, suggesting a higher clinical benefit of PD-L1 and IDO1 inhibition in OSCC from NSND. © The Author 2017.

AB Recently, cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) was suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the exact role of folate metabolism in the pathogenesis of ASD, identification of underlying pathogenic mechanisms and impaired metabolic pathways remain unexplained. The aim of our study was to develop and test a novel, unbiased, bioinformatics approach in order to identify links between ASD and disturbed cerebral metabolism by focusing on abnormal folate metabolism, which could foster patient stratification and novel therapeutic interventions. An unbiased, automatable, computational workflow interaction model was developed using available data from public databases. The interaction network model of ASD-associated genes with known cerebral expression and function (SFARI) and metabolic networks (MetScape), including connections to known metabolic substrates, metabolites and cofactors involving folates, was established. Intersection of bioinformatically created networks resulted in a limited amount of interaction modules pointing to common disturbed metabolic pathways, linking ASD to CFD. Two independent interaction modules (comprising three pathways) covering enzymes encoded by ASD-related genes and folate cofactors utilizing enzymes were generated. Module 1 suggested possible interference of CFD with serine and lysine metabolism, while module 2 identified correlations with purine metabolism and inosine monophosphate production. Since our approach was primarily conceived as a proof of principle, further amendments of the presented initial model are necessary to obtain additional actionable outcomes. Our modelling strategy identified not only previously known interactions supported by evidence-based analyses, but also novel plausible interactions, which could be validated in subsequent functional and/or clinical studies.

AB Identification of novel therapeutics in pelvic high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) has been hampered by a paucity of actionable point mutations in target genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent of amplification of the therapeutically targetable NSD3-CHD8-BRD4 pathway in pelvic HGSC, and to determine whether amplification is associated with worse prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian and endometrial cancer cohorts were retrospectively analyzed via online data-mining tools to test the association of NSD3, CHD8 and BRD4 genomic alterations with survival of pelvic HGSC patients. It was demonstrated that amplification of the NSD3-CHD8-BRD4 pathway in the ovarian HGSC cohort (observed in 18% of the cases, 88/489) was significantly associated with worse overall and progression-free survival compared with non-amplified cases. In addition, amplification of NSD3, CHD8 and BRD4 also occurred in 9% (21/232) of overall endometrial cancer TCGA cases, which was associated with worse overall survival. In the endometrial cancer TCGA cohort, NSD3, CHD8 and BRD4 amplification occurred specifically in the serous carcinoma (25%, 13/53) and 'serous-like' copy number high endometrial carcinoma (33%, 20/60) subgroups, compared with the polymerase e (0%, 0/17), microsatellite instability high (0%, 0/65) or low copy number (1%, 1/90) subgroups. These findings support the hypothesis that amplification of the NSD3-BRD4-CDH8 axis is frequent in pelvic HGSC of both ovarian and endometrial origin, and that this pathway is potentially targetable in a subset of HGSC patients.

AB Purpose: Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a devastating soft tissue sarcoma affecting predominantly young individuals. Tyrosine kinases (TK) and associated pathways are continuously activated in many malignancies, including EWS; these enzymes provide candidate therapeutic targets.Experimental Design: Two high-throughput screens (a siRNA library and a small-molecule inhibitor library) were performed in EWS cells to establish candidate targets. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) phosphorylation was assessed in EWS patients and cell lines. SYK was inhibited by a variety of genetic and pharmacological approaches, and SYK-regulated pathways were investigated by cDNA microarrays. The transcriptional regulation of MALAT1 was examined by ChIP-qPCR, luciferase reporter, and qRT-PCR assays.Results: SYK was identified as a candidate actionable target through both high-throughput screens. SYK was highly phosphorylated in the majority of EWS cells, and SYK inhibition by a variety of genetic and pharmacologic approaches markedly inhibited EWS cells both in vitro and in vivo Ectopic expression of SYK rescued the cytotoxicity triggered by SYK-depletion associated with the reactivation of both AKT and c-MYC. A long noncoding RNA, MALAT1, was identified to be dependent on SYK-mediated signaling. Moreover, c-MYC, a SYK-promoted gene, bound to the promoter of MALAT1 and transcriptionally activated MALAT1, which further promoted the proliferation of EWS cells.Conclusions: This study identifies a novel signaling involving SYK/c-MYC/MALAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of EWS.

AB BACKGROUND: Incisional hernia remains a persistent and burdensome complication after colectomy. Through individualized risk-assessment and prediction models, we aimed to improve preoperative risk counseling for patients undergoing colectomy; identify modifiable preoperative risk factors; and encourage the use of evidence-based risk-prediction instruments in the clinical setting.; STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data was conducted for all patients undergoing either open or laparoscopic colectomy as identified through the state inpatient databases of California, Florida, and New York in 2009. Incidence of incisional hernia repair was collected from both the state inpatient databases and the state ambulatory surgery and services databases in the 3 states between index surgery and 2011. Hernia risk was calculated with multivariable hierarchical logistic regression modeling and validated using bootstrapping techniques. Exclusion criteria included concurrent hernia, metastasis, mortality, and age younger than 18 years. Inflation-adjusted expenditure estimates were calculated.; RESULTS: Overall, 30,741 patients underwent colectomy, one-third of these procedures performed laparoscopically. Incisional hernia repair was performed in 2,563 patients (8.3%) (27-month follow-up). Fourteen significant risk factors were identified, including open surgery (odds ratio= 1.49; p < 0.0001), obesity (odds ratio= 1.49; p < 0.0001), and alcohol abuse (odds ratio= 1.39; p= 0.010). Extreme-risk patients experienced the highest incidence of incisional hernia (19.8%) vs low-risk patients (3.9%) (C-statistic= 0.67).; CONCLUSIONS: We present a clinically actionable model of incisional hernia using all-payer claims after colectomy. The data presented can structure preoperative risk counseling, identify modifiable patient-specific risk factors, and advance the field of risk prediction using claims data.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze a glioblastoma tumor specimen with 3 different platforms and compare potentially actionable calls from each.; METHODS: Tumor DNA was analyzed by a commercial targeted panel. In addition, tumor-normal DNA was analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and tumor RNA was analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The WGS and RNA-seq data were analyzed by a team of bioinformaticians and cancer oncologists, and separately by IBM Watson Genomic Analytics (WGA), an automated system for prioritizing somatic variants and identifying drugs.; RESULTS: More variants were identified by WGS/RNA analysis than by targeted panels. WGA completed a comparable analysis in a fraction of the time required by the human analysts.; CONCLUSIONS: The development of an effective human-machine interface in the analysis of deep cancer genomic datasets may provide potentially clinically actionable calls for individual patients in a more timely and efficient manner than currently possible.; CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02725684.

AB BACKGROUND: It is estimated that between 80% and 99% of alarms in the clinical areas are in actionable alarms (Gross, Dahl, & Nielson). Alarm management is one of the Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals (2014) because sentinel events have directly been linked to the devices generating these alarms.; PURPOSE: At an acute care facility in Boston, a multidisciplinary team consisting of Nursing, Biomedical Engineers, Patient Safety and Providers was formed to conduct a pilot study on the state of telemetry alarms on a surgical floor.; METHODS: An evidence-based approach was taken utilizing Philips Real-time data exporter alarms tracking software to capture all telemetry alarms during a 43-day time span. Likewise, noise meters were placed near telemetry alarm speakers to track decibel levels within the aforementioned timeframe for 21 days. Analysis of the data showed that clinically insignificant Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC) alarms accounted for more than 40% of all alarms in the unit within the time span, while also contributing to an average noise level of 58.49 dB. In response to the data, the interdisciplinary team approved to permanently default the settings for PAIR PVC, MULTIFORM PVC, and RUN PVC alarms to off.; RESULTS: The results showed a 54% decrease in the rate of alarms per bed per day, and an average noise reduction of 2.3 dB between the two selected noise measurement areas.; LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Organizing a multidisciplinary team provides an effective framework toward analyzing and addressing cardiac telemetry alarm fatigue. Looking at quantitative datasets for clinical care areas through various lenses helps identify opportunities for improvement in regards to highlighting alarms that are not actionable. Pilot changes to alarm parameters can be tested for their environmental impact in the care area. © 2017 Sigma Theta Tau International.

AB INTRODUCTION: Common recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in prostate cancer through comprehensive sequencing efforts, and the prevalence of mutations in DNA repair pathway genes in patients with advanced and metastatic disease approaches 20-25%. Identification of these underlying DNA repair defects may present unique treatment opportunities for patients, both in terms of standard-of-care treatments and selected investigational agents. Areas covered: We review our current understanding of the genomic landscape of prostate cancer, with special attention to alterations in DNA repair pathway genes in metastatic castration-resistant disease. For patients with tumors deficient in homologous recombination repair, potential opportunities for treatment include platinum chemotherapy, poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, bipolar androgen therapy, and maybe immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In addition, tumors with mismatch repair defects (i.e. microsatellite instability) may be particularly susceptible to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Expert commentary: We anticipate that genomic profiling of tumors will become necessary to guide treatment of advanced prostate cancer in the coming years. Work is needed to define the optimal tissue to test, and to define the natural history of tumors with specific genetic defects. The prognostic and therapeutic importance of germline vs somatic DNA repair alterations, and mono-allelic vs bi-allelic inactivation, also remains unclear. Finally, optimal strategies to sequence or combine targeted agents for these patients with 'actionable' mutations are now needed.

AB Despite its successful use in academic research, next-generation sequencing (NGS) still represents many challenges for routine clinical adoption due to its inherent complexity and specialised expertise typically required to set-up, test and operate a complete workflow.This study aims to evaluate QIAGEN's newly launched GeneReader NGS System solution in a pathology laboratory setting by assessing the system's ease of use, sequencing accuracy and data reproducibility. Our laboratory was able to implement the system and validate its performance using clinical samples in direct comparison to an approved Sanger sequencing platform and to an alternative in-house NGS technology. The QIAGEN workflow focuses on clinically actionable hotspots maximising testing efficiency. Combined with automated upstream sample processing and integrated downstream bioinformatics, it offers a realistic solution for pathology laboratories with limited prior experience in NGS technology.

AB AIM: To evaluate nuclear imaging center attributes that cardiologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) consider when referring patients for single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) tests, and how these attributes impact physician referral decisions in the United States.; METHODS: A targeted literature review and seven one-to-one interviews with physicians and imaging center directors were conducted to identify attributes that could impact physicians' referral decisions. The impact of the identified attributes was assessed via an online discrete choice survey among eligible PCPs and cardiologists randomly selected from a nationally representative panel, and quantified with an odds ratio (OR) scale estimated with a multivariable logistic regression.; RESULTS: Nine two-level attributes were identified: ease of the referral process, waiting time for tests, insurance preauthorization assistance, time to receive results, conclusive test reports, patient satisfaction, a protocol for rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test, patient communication, and assistance with parking/wheelchair access. A total of 410 physicians, including 208 (50.7%) cardiologists and 202 (49.3%) PCPs completed the survey. Among all physicians, a protocol that allows for a rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test (OR=2.9) and preauthorization assistance (OR=2.6) were the most impactful attributes. Additionally, cardiologists preferred imaging centers that provide an easy referral process (OR=2.7), while PCPs favored centers offering a conclusive test report (OR=2.4).; LIMITATIONS: Some center features that might impact physician referral decision were not evaluated in this study, if they were not easily changeable from an imaging center's perspective.; CONCLUSIONS: The availability of a protocol for rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test and preauthorization assistance had the most significant impact on physician referral decisions for SPECT-MPI. Additionally, cardiologists preferred centers providing an easy referral process, while PCPs favored those offering a concluding statement and actionable steps in test reports.

AB Objective Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcomas are rare, aggressive tumors of the skull base. Treatment options are limited and outcomes are poor. Little is known in regard to the genetic factors regulating these tumors. Characterization of actionable molecular alterations in these tumors could provide potentially successful therapeutic options. Methods We performed targeted exome sequencing on an index sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma specimen to identify potential driver mutations. We performed immunohistochemical stains for beta-catenin on paraffin-embedded tissue on the index tumor and a subsequent teratocarcinosarcoma. Online databases of cancer mutations (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer and The Cancer Genome Atlas) were accessed. Results We identified an activating p.S45F mutation in beta-catenin in our index sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma. This mutation results in constitutive signaling in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. We confirmed beta-catenin overexpression and nuclear localization via immunohistochemistry in the index tumor and a second patient. The p.S45F activating mutation was found in a variety of solid tumors, and accounts for 3.3 to 10.4% of all known beta-catenin mutations. Conclusion We identified a potential driver mutation in beta-catenin in a sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma, resulting in beta-catenin overexpression. These findings suggest a role for the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma tumorigenesis and a role for anti-beta-catenin targeted therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: The importance of effective team leadership for achieving surgical excellence is widely accepted, but we understand less about the behaviors that achievethis goal. We studied cardiac surgical teams to identify leadership behaviors that best support surgical teamwork.; METHODS: We observed, surveyed, and interviewed cardiac surgical teams, including 7 surgeons and 116 team members, from September 2013 to April 2015. We documented 1,926 surgeon/team member interactions during 22 cases, coded them by behavior type and valence (ie,positive/negative/neutral), and characterized them by leadership function (conductor, elucidator, delegator, engagement facilitator, tone setter, being human, and safe space maker) to create a novel framework of surgical leadership derived from direct observation. We surveyed nonsurgeon team members about their perceptions of individual surgeon's leadership effectiveness on a 7-point Likert scale and correlated survey measures with individual surgeon profiles created by calculating percentage of behavior types, leader functions, and valence.; RESULTS: Surgeon leadership was rated by nonsurgeons from 4.2 to 6.2 (mean, 5.4). Among the 33 types of behaviors observed, most interactions constituted elucidating (24%) and tone setting (20%). Overall, 66% of interactions (range, 43%-84%) were positive and 11% (range, 1%-45%) were negative. The percentage of positive and negative behaviors correlated strongly (r = 0.85 for positive and r = 0.75 for negative, p < 0.05) with nonsurgeon evaluations of leadership. Facilitating engagement related most positively (r= 0.80; p= 0.03), and negative forms of elucidating, ie, criticism, related most negatively (r= -0.81; p= 0.03).; CONCLUSIONS: We identified 7 surgeon leadership functions and related behaviors that impact perceptions of leadership. These observations suggest actionable opportunities to improve team leadership behavior. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Genomic applications raise multiple challenges including the optimization of genomic counseling (GC) services as part of the results delivery process. More information on patients' motivations, preferences, and informational needs are essential to guide the development of new, more efficient practice delivery models that capitalize on the existing strengths of a limited genetic counseling workforce. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a subset of counselees from the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative following online receipt of multiple personalized genomic test reports. Participants previously had either in-person GC (chronic disease cohort, n=20; mean age 60years) or telephone GC (community cohort, n=31; mean age 46.8years). Transcripts were analyzed using a Grounded Theory framework. Major themes that emerged from the interviews include 1) primary reasons for seeking GC were to clarify results, put results into perspective relative to other health-related concerns, and to receive personalized recommendations; 2) there is need for a more participant driven approach in terms of mode of GC communication (in-person, phone, video), and refining the counseling agenda pre-session; and 3) there was strong interest in the option of follow up GC. By clarifying counselees' expectations, views and desired outcomes, we have uncovered a need for a more participant-driven GC model when potentially actionable genomic results are received online.

AB Objectives: To highlight and provide insights into key developments in translational bioinformatics between 2014 and 2016. Methods: This review describes some of the most influential bioinformatics papers and resources that have been published between 2014 and 2016 as well as the national genome sequencing initiatives that utilize these resources to routinely embed genomic medicine into healthcare. Also discussed are some applications of the secondary use of patient data followed by a comprehensive view of the open challenges and emergent technologies. Results: Although data generation can be performed routinely, analyses and data integration methods still require active research and standardization to improve streamlining of clinical interpretation. The secondary use of patient data has resulted in the development of novel algorithms and has enabled a refined understanding of cellular and phenotypic mechanisms. New data storage and data sharing approaches are required to enable diverse biomedical communities to contribute to genomic discovery. Conclusion: The translation of genomics data into actionable knowledge for use in healthcare is transforming the clinical landscape in an unprecedented way. Exciting and innovative models that bridge the gap between clinical and academic research are set to open up the field of translational bioinformatics for rapid growth in a digital era.

AB Recent breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing technology and complementary genomic platforms have transformed our capacity to interrogate the molecular landscapes of human cancers, including childhood brain tumors. Numerous high-throughput genomic studies have been reported for the major histologic brain tumor entities diagnosed in children, including interrogations at the level of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome, many of which have yielded essential new insights into disease biology. The nature of these discoveries has been largely platform dependent, exemplifying the usefulness of applying different genomic and computational strategies, or integrative approaches, to address specific biologic and/or clinical questions. The goal of this article is to summarize the spectrum of molecular profiling methods available for investigating genomic aspects of childhood brain tumors in both the research and the clinical setting. We provide an overview of the main next-generation sequencing and array-based technologies currently being applied in this field and draw from key examples in the recent neuro-oncology literature to illustrate how these genomic approaches have profoundly advanced our understanding of individual tumor entities. Moreover, we discuss the current status of genomic profiling in the clinic and how different platforms are being used to improve patient diagnosis and stratification, as well as to identify actionable targets for informing molecularly guided therapies, especially for patients for whom conventional standard-of-care treatments have failed. Both the demand for genomic testing and the main challenges associated with incorporating genomics into the clinical management of pediatric patients with brain tumors are discussed, as are recommendations for incorporating these assays into future clinical trials.

AB Purpose: Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma by inducing DNA damage. We hypothesize that somatic alterations in DNA damage response and repair (DDR) genes are associated with improved sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy.Experimental Design: Patients with diagnosis of locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with platinum-based chemotherapy who had exon sequencing with the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay were identified. Patients were dichotomized based on the presence/absence of alterations in a panel of 34 DDR genes. DDR alteration status was correlated with clinical outcomes and disease features.Results: One hundred patients were identified, of which 47 harbored alterations in DDR genes. Patients with DDR alterations had improved progression-free survival (9.3 vs. 6.0 months, log-rank P = 0.007) and overall survival (23.7 vs. 13.0 months, log-rank P = 0.006). DDR alterations were also associated with higher number mutations and copy-number alterations. A trend toward positive correlation between DDR status and nodal metastases and inverse correlation with visceral metastases were observed. Different DDR pathways also suggested variable impact on clinical outcomes.Conclusions: Somatic DDR alteration is associated with improved clinical outcomes in platinum-treated patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. Once validated, it can improve patient selection for clinical practice and future study enrollment. Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3610-8. ©2017 AACR. ©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Dementia is the most common neurological disorder worldwide and is a life-limiting condition, but very often is not recognised as such. People with dementia, and their carers, have been shown to have palliative care needs equal in extent to those of cancer patients. However, many people with advanced dementia are not routinely being assessed to determine their palliative care needs, and it is not clear why this is so.; MAIN BODY: An interdisciplinary workshop on "Palliative Care in Neurodegeneration, with a focus on Dementia", was held in Cork, Ireland, in May 2016. The key aim of this workshop was to discuss the evidence base for palliative care for people with dementia, to identify 'gaps' for clinical research, and to make recommendations for interdisciplinary research practice. To lead the discussion throughout the day a multidisciplinary panel of expert speakers were brought together, including both researchers and clinicians from across Ireland and the UK. Targeted invitations were sent to attendees ensuring all key stakeholders were present to contribute to discussions. In total, 49 experts representing 17 different academic and practice settings, attended. Key topics for discussion were pre-selected based on previously identified research priorities (e.g. James Lind Alliance) and stakeholder input. Key discussion topics included: i. Advance Care Planning for people with Dementia; ii. Personhood in End-of-life Dementia care; iii. Topics in the care of advanced dementia at home. These topics were used as a starting point, and the ethos of the workshop was that the attendees could stimulate discussion and debate in any relevant area, not just the key topics, summarised under iv. Other priorities.; CONCLUSIONS: The care experienced by people with dementia and their families has the potential to be improved; palliative care frameworks may have much to offer in this endeavour. However, a solid evidence base is required to translate palliative care into practice in the context of dementia. This paper presents suggested research priorities as a starting point to build this evidence base. An interdisciplinary approach to research and priority setting is essential to develop actionable knowledge in this area.

AB Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma represents the second most common primary liver cancer and is increasing in incidence. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced, nonsurgical stage and only about 1 in 5 cases are surgically resectable. Despite surgery, the 5-year survival is low at only 30%. Multifocal, node- or margin-positive disease is at a higher risk of recurrence after resection. There is no level 1 evidence in support of postoperative adjuvant therapy. A recent adjuvant therapy phase III trial from the Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie Digestive-Actions Concertees dans les Cancers Colo-Rectaux et Digestifs (PRODIGE) group reported no survival advantage with adjuvant gemcitabine and oxaliplatin therapy. Locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is treated with gemcitabine-based systemic chemotherapy with suboptimal response and survival. Integration of local therapy such as focal radiation along with induction chemotherapy is now being investigated in multicenter clinical trials. Recent molecular profiling studies have indicated that about 30% to 40% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cases have actionable mutations. These include fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), isocitrate dehyrogenase 1 (IDH1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and BRAF genetic aberrations. Clinical trials targeting these mutations as well as immune therapy using programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibitors indicated a promising early signal showing clinical efficacy.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of multigene panel testing among Ashkenazi Jewish compared with non-Ashkenazi Jewish patients.; METHODS: We reviewed the medical records for all patients who underwent multigene panel testing and targeted BRCA1/2 testing at a single institution between 6/2013-1/2015. Clinical actionability for identified pathogenic mutations was characterized based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and consensus statements and expert opinion for genes not addressed by these guidelines.; RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-four patients underwent multigene panel screening, including 138 Ashkenazi Jewish patients. The median patient age was fifty-two years. Three hundred and fifty-four patients (78%) had a personal history of cancer. Two hundred and fifty-one patients had breast cancer, 49, ovarian cancer, 26, uterine cancer and 20, colorectal cancer. We identified 62 mutations in 56 patients and 291 variants of uncertain significance in 196 patients. Among the 56 patients with mutations, 51 (91%) had actionable mutations. Twenty mutations were identified by multigene panels among Ashkenazi Jewish patients, 18 of which were in genes other than BRCA1/2. A review of targeted BRCA1/2 testing performed over the same study period included 103 patients and identified six mutations in BRCA1/2, all of which occurred in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Among all Ashkenazi Jewish patients undergoing genetic testing, 25/183 (14%) had a mutation, 24/25 of which were actionable (96%) and 17/25 patients (68%) had mutations in non BRCA1/2 genes.; CONCLUSIONS: With the rapid acceptance of multigene panels there is a pressing need to understand how this testing will affect patient management. While traditionally many Ashkenazi Jewish patients have undergone targeted BRCA1/2 testing, our data suggest consideration of multigene panels in this population as the majority of the results are clinically actionable and often in genes other than BRCA1/2.

AB BACKGROUND: Alarm fatigue (AF) is a distressing factor for staff and patients in the hospital. Using cardiac telemetry (CT) without clinical indications can create unnecessary alarms, and increase AF and cost of healthcare. We sought to reduce AF and cost associated with CT monitoring.; METHODS: After implementing a new protocol for CT placement, data were collected on telemetry orders, alarms and bed cost for 13 weeks from 1 January 2015 through 31 March 2015. We also retrospectively collected data on the same variables for the 13 weeks prior to the intervention. A survey was administered to nurses to assess past and present perceptions of AF. Interventions included protocol creation and education for participants.; RESULTS: At baseline, 77% of patients were monitored with CT. A total of 145 (31%) order discrepancies were discovered during data collection, of which 72% had no indication for CT, so CT was discontinued. The other 28% had indications, so orders were placed. A total of 8336 alarms were recorded during 4 weeks of data collection, of which 333 (4%) were classified as true actionable alarms. Postintervention data showed 67% CT assignment with 10% reduction in CT usage, with no increase in mortality (p<0.001and >0.05, respectively). A 42% cost reduction was achieved after adjusting the patient status. Nurses reported 27% perceived reduction in AF. One-year follow-up revealed that 69% of patients were being monitored by CT, and the rate of order discrepancies due to lack of indication was 9%.; CONCLUSION: All hospital units may benefit from the protocols created during this study. If applied appropriately, these protocols can lead to reduced AF and cost per episode of care. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

AB AIM: Develop and apply a comprehensive and accurate next-generation sequencing based assay to help clinicians to match oncology patients to therapies.; MATERIALS & METHODS: The performance of the CANCERPLEX assay was assessed using DNA from well-characterized routine clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and cell lines.; RESULTS: The maximum sensitivity of the assay is 99.5% and its accuracy is virtually 100% for detecting somatic alterations with an allele fraction of as low as 10%. Clinically actionable variants were identified in 93% of patients (930 of 1000) who underwent testing.; CONCLUSION: The test's capacity to determine all of the critical genetic changes, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability status and viral associations has important ramifications on clinical decision support strategies, including identification of patients who are likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockage therapies.

AB A recent effort has been made to better characterize the genetic architecture of schizophrenia, and apply a precision medicine model to its treatment. In pursuing this approach, it is likely that ethical concerns regarding cost-benefit uncertainties, the duty to inform and confidentiality will arise. Due to the complexity of schizophrenia's genetic profile, research efforts must be weighed against the risk to human subjects and the required consumption of valuable healthcare resources. Genetic risk profiles must be judged in conjunction with actionability and must be fully explained to patients and others potentially affected. However, confidentiality should be of paramount importance due to the presence of a risk-state phenotype, meaning the associated presence of clinically detectable neurocognitive deficiencies in those with elevated schizophrenia risk profiles.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic tests of the cancer predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 inform significant clinical decisions for both physicians and patients. Most uncovered variants are benign, and determining which few are pathogenic (disease-causing) is sometimes challenging and can potentially be inconsistent among laboratories. The ClinVar database makes de-identified clinical variant classifications from multiple laboratories publicly available for comparison and review, per recommendations of the American Medical Association (AMA), the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), the National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC), and other organizations.; METHODS: Classifications of more than 2000 BRCA1/2 variants in ClinVar representing approximately 22,000 patients were dichotomized as clinically actionable or not actionable and compared across up to seven laboratories. The properties of these variants and classification differences were investigated in detail.; RESULTS: Per-variant concordance was 98.5% (CI 97.9%-99.0%). All discordant variants were rare; thus, per patient concordance was estimated to be higher: 99.7%. ClinVar facilitated resolution of many of the discordant variants, and concordance increased to 99.0% per variant and 99.8% per patient when reclassified (but not yet resubmitted) variants and submission errors were addressed. Most of the remaining discordances appeared to involve either legitimate differences in expert judgment regarding particular scientific evidence, or were classifications that predated availability of important scientific evidence.; CONCLUSIONS: Significant classification disagreements among the professional clinical laboratories represented in ClinVar are infrequent yet important. The unrestricted sharing of clinical genetic data allows detailed interlaboratory quality control and peer review, as exemplified by this study.

AB Ovarian cancer represents the most common gynaecological malignancy and has the highest mortality of all female reproductive cancers. It has a rare predilection to develop brain metastases (BM). In this study, we evaluated the mutational profile of ovarian cancer metastases through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) with the aim of identifying potential clinically actionable genetic alterations with options for small molecule targeted therapy. Library preparation was conducted using Illumina TruSight Rapid Capture Kit in combination with a cancer specific enrichment kit covering 94 genes. BRCA-mutations were confirmed by using TruSeq Custom Amplicon Low Input Kit in combination with a custom-designed BRCA gene panel. In our cohort all eight sequenced BM samples exhibited a multitude of variant alterations, each with unique molecular profiles. The 37 identified variants were distributed over 22 cancer-related genes (23.4%). The number of mutated genes per sample ranged from 3 to 7 with a median of 4.5. The most commonly altered genes were BRCA1/2, TP53, and ATM. In total, 7 out of 8 samples revealed either a BRCA1 or a BRCA2 pathogenic mutation. Furthermore, all eight BM samples showed mutations in at least one DNA repair gene. Our NGS study of BM of ovarian carcinoma revealed a significant number of BRCA-mutations beside TP53, ATM and CHEK2 mutations. These findings strongly suggest the implication of BRCA and DNA repair malfunction in ovarian cancer metastasizing to the brain. Based on these findings, pharmacological PARP inhibition could be one potential targeted therapeutic for brain metastatic ovarian cancer patients.

AB Laboratory accreditation provides a level of standardization in laboratories and confidence in generated food and feed testing results. For some laboratories, ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation may not be fiscally viable, or a requested test method may be out of the scope of the laboratory's accreditation. To assist laboratories for whom accreditation is not feasible, the Association of Public Health Laboratories Data Acceptance Work Group developed a white paper entitled "Best Practices for Submission of Actionable Food and Feed Testing Data Generated in State and Local Laboratories." The basic elements of a quality management system, along with other best practices that state and local food and feed testing laboratories should follow, are included in the white paper. It also covers program-specific requirements that may need to be addressed. Communication with programs and end data users is regarded as essential for establishing the reliability and accuracy of laboratory data. Following these suggested best practices can facilitate the acceptance of laboratory data, which can result in swift regulatory action and the quick removal of contaminated product from the food supply, improving public health nationally.

AB Phenomenon: The purpose of "systematic" reviews/reviewers of medical and health professions educational research is to identify best practices. This qualitative article explores the question of whether systematic reviews can support "evidence informed" teaching and contrasts traditional systematic reviewing with a knowledge translation (KT) approach to this objective.; APPROACH: Degrees of freedom analysis (DOFA) is used to examine the alignment of systematic review methods with educational research and the pedagogical strategies and approaches that might be considered with a decision-making framework developed to support valid assessment. This method is also used to explore how KT can be used to inform teaching and learning.; FINDINGS: The nature of educational research is not compatible with most (11/14) methods for systematic review. The inconsistency of systematic reviewing with the nature of educational research impedes both the identification and implementation of "best-evidence" pedagogy and teaching. This is primarily because research questions that do support the purposes of review do not support educational decision making. By contrast to systematic reviews of the literature, both a DOFA and KT are fully compatible with informing teaching using evidence. A DOFA supports the translation of theory to a specific teaching or learning case, so could be considered a type of KT. The DOFA results in a test of alignment of decision options with relevant educational theory, and KT leads to interventions in teaching or learning that can be evaluated. Examples of how to structure evaluable interventions are derived from a KT approach that are simply not available from a systematic review. Insights: Systematic reviewing of current empirical educational research is not suitable for deriving or supporting best practices in education. However, both "evidence-informed" and scholarly approaches to teaching can be supported as KT projects, which are inherently evaluable and can generate actionable evidence about whether the decision or intervention worked for students, instructors, and the institution. A DOFA can also support evidence- and theory-informed teaching to develop an understanding of what works, why, and for whom. Thus KT, but not systematic reviewing, can support decision making around pedagogy (and pedagogical innovation) that can also inform new teaching and learning initiatives; it can also point to new avenues of empirical research in education that are informed by, and can inform, theory.

AB INTRODUCTION: The use of syndromic surveillance has expanded from its initial purpose of bioterrorism detection. We present 6 use cases from New York City that demonstrate the value of syndromic surveillance for public health response and decision making across a broad range of health outcomes: synthetic cannabinoid drug use, heat-related illness, suspected meningococcal disease, medical needs after severe weather, asthma exacerbation after a building collapse, and Ebola-like illness in travelers returning from West Africa.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The New York City syndromic surveillance system receives data on patient visits from all emergency departments (EDs) in the city. The data are used to assign syndrome categories based on the chief complaint and discharge diagnosis, and analytic methods are used to monitor geographic and temporal trends and detect clusters.; RESULTS: For all 6 use cases, syndromic surveillance using ED data provided actionable information. Syndromic surveillance helped detect a rise in synthetic cannabinoid-related ED visits, prompting a public health investigation and action. Surveillance of heat-related illness indicated increasing health effects of severe weather and led to more urgent public health messaging. Surveillance of meningitis-related ED visits helped identify unreported cases of culture-negative meningococcal disease. Syndromic surveillance also proved useful for assessing a surge of methadone-related ED visits after Superstorm Sandy, provided reassurance of no localized increases in asthma after a building collapse, and augmented traditional disease reporting during the West African Ebola outbreak.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Sharing syndromic surveillance use cases can foster new ideas and build capacity for public health preparedness and response.

AB Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled physicians to test for genomic alterations in multiple cancer-related genes at once in daily clinical practice. In April 2015, we introduced clinical sequencing using an NGS-based multiplex gene assay (OncoPrime) certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment. This assay covers the entire coding regions of 215 genes and the rearrangement of 17 frequently rearranged genes with clinical relevance in human cancers. The principal indications for the assay were cancers of unknown primary site, rare tumors, and any solid tumors that were refractory to standard chemotherapy. A total of 85 patients underwent testing with multiplex gene assay between April 2015 and July 2016. The most common solid tumor types tested were pancreatic (n = 19; 22.4%), followed by biliary tract (n = 14; 16.5%), and tumors of unknown primary site (n = 13; 15.3%). Samples from 80 patients (94.1%) were successfully sequenced. The median turnaround time was 40 days (range, 18-70 days). Potentially actionable mutations were identified in 69 of 80 patients (86.3%) and were most commonly found in TP53 (46.3%), KRAS (23.8%), APC (18.8%), STK11 (7.5%), and ATR (7.5%). Nine patients (13.0%) received a subsequent therapy based on the NGS assay results. Implementation of clinical sequencing using an NGS-based multiplex gene assay was feasible in the clinical setting and identified potentially actionable mutations in more than 80% of patients. Current challenges are to incorporate this genomic information into better therapeutic decision making. © 2017 The Authors.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the highest mortality rate of all epithelial malignancies and a paradoxically rising incidence rate. Clinical translation of next generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour and germline samples may ameliorate outcomes by identifying prognostic and predictive genomic and transcriptomic features in appreciable fractions of patients, facilitating enrolment in biomarker-matched trials. Areas covered: The literature on precision oncology is reviewed. It is found that outcomes may be improved across various malignancies, and it is suggested that current issues of adequate tissue acquisition, turnaround times, analytic expertise and clinical trial accessibility may lessen as experience accrues. Also reviewed are PDAC genomic and transcriptomic NGS studies, emphasizing discoveries of promising biomarkers, though these require validation, and the fraction of patients that will benefit from these outside of the research setting is currently unknown. Expert commentary: Clinical use of NGS with PDAC should be used in investigational contexts in centers with multidisciplinary expertise in cancer sequencing and pancreatic cancer management. Biomarker directed studies will improve our understanding of actionable genomic variation in PDAC, and improve outcomes for this challenging disease.

AB Formerly defined "critical values", the importance of critical results (CRs) management in patient care has grown in recent years. According to the George Lundberg definition the result becomes "critical" when, exceeding actionable thresholds, it suggests imminent danger for the patient, unless appropriate therapy is initiated promptly. As required in most important accreditation standards, such as the ISO:15,189 or the Joint Commission standards, a quality reporting system should deliver the correct result to the appropriate clinician in a time-frame that ensures patient safety. From this point of view, medical laboratories should implement a process that assures the most effective communication in a timely manner, to the referring physician or care team member. Failure in communication, particularly in this type of situation, continues to be one of the most common factors contributing to the occurrence of adverse events. In the last few decades, Information Technology (IT) in Health Care has become increasingly important. The ability to interface radiology, anatomic pathology or laboratory information systems with electronic medical records is now a real opportunity, offering much safer communication than in the past. Future achievements on performance criteria and quality indicators for the notification of CRs, should ensure a comparable examination across different institutions, adding value to clinical laboratories in controlling post-analytical processes that concern patient safety. Therefore, the novel approach to CRs should combine quality initiatives, IT solutions and a culture to strengthen professional interaction. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent advances in sequencing technologies supported the development of molecularly targeted therapy in cancer patients. Thus, genomic analyses are becoming a routine part in clinical practice and accurate detection of actionable mutations is essential to assist diagnosis and therapy choice. However, this is often challenging due to major problems associated with DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue which is usually the primary source for genetic testing.; OBJECTIVES: Here we want to share our experience regarding major problems associated with FFPE DNA used for PCR-based sequencing as illustrated by the mutational analysis of ERBB4 in melanoma. We want to focus on two major problems including extensive DNA fragmentation and hydrolytic deamination as source of non-reproducible sequence artifacts. Further, we provide potential explanations and possible strategies to minimize these difficulties and improve the detection of targetable mutations.; METHODS: Genomic DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples was isolated followed by PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing and statistical analysis.; RESULTS: Analysis of Sanger sequencing data revealed a total of 46 ERBB4 mutations in 27 of 96 samples including the identification of 11 mutations at three previously unknown mutational hotspots. Unfortunately, we were not able to confirm any assumed hotspot mutation within repeated sequencing of relevant amplicons suggesting the detection of sequence artifacts most likely caused by DNA lesions associated with FFPE tissues.; CONCLUSION: Since DNA from FFPE tissue is usually the primary source for mutational analyses, appropriate measures must be implemented in the workflow to assess DNA damage in formalin-fixed tissue to ensure accurate detection of actionable mutations and minimize the occurrence of sequence artifacts.

AB PURPOSE: A long natural history and a predominant osseous pattern of metastatic spread are impediments to the adoption of precision medicine in patients with prostate cancer. To establish the feasibility of clinical genomic profiling in the disease, we performed targeted deep sequencing of tumor and normal DNA from patients with locoregional, metastatic non-castrate, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).; METHODS: Patients consented to genomic analysis of their tumor and germline DNA. A hybridization capture-based clinical assay was employed to identify single nucleotide variations, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations and structural rearrangements in over 300 cancer-related genes in tumors and matched normal blood.; RESULTS: We successfully sequenced 504 tumors from 451 patients with prostate cancer. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in DNA damage repair (DDR), PI3K, and MAP kinase pathways. 27% of patients harbored a germline or a somatic alteration in a DDR gene that may predict for response to PARP inhibition. Profiling of matched tumors from individual patients revealed that somatic TP53 and BRCA2 alterations arose early in tumors from patients who eventually developed metastatic disease. In contrast, comparative analysis across disease states revealed that APC alterations were enriched in metastatic tumors, while ATM alterations were specifically enriched in CRPC.; CONCLUSION: Through genomic profiling of prostate tumors representing the disease clinical spectrum, we identified a high frequency of potentially actionable alterations and possible drivers of disease initiation, metastasis and castration-resistance. Our findings support the routine use of tumor and germline DNA profiling for patients with advanced prostate cancer, for the purpose of guiding enrollment in targeted clinical trials and counseling families at increased risk of malignancy.

AB PURPOSE: With prospective clinical sequencing of tumors emerging as a mainstay in cancer care, there is an urgent need for a clinical support tool that distills the clinical implications associated with specific mutation events into a standardized and easily interpretable format. To this end, we developed OncoKB, an expert-guided precision oncology knowledge base.; METHODS: OncoKB annotates the biological and oncogenic effect and the prognostic and predictive significance of somatic molecular alterations. Potential treatment implications are stratified by the level of evidence that a specific molecular alteration is predictive of drug response based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, disease-focused expert group recommendations and the scientific literature.; RESULTS: To date, over 3000 unique mutations, fusions, and copy number alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes have been annotated. To test the utility of OncoKB, we annotated all genomic events in 5983 primary tumor samples in 19 cancer types. Forty-one percent of samples harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, of which 7.5% were predictive of clinical benefit from a standard treatment. OncoKB annotations are available through a public web resource (http://oncokb.org/) and are also incorporated into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to facilitate the interpretation of genomic alterations by physicians and researchers.; CONCLUSION: OncoKB, a comprehensive and curated precision oncology knowledge base, offers oncologists detailed, evidence-based information about individual somatic mutations and structural alterations present in patient tumors with the goal of supporting optimal treatment decisions.

AB The identification of driver mutations in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has changed the treatment outcomes for patients with actionable driver mutations. Lack of tissue at diagnosis, however, remains a central obstacle in making optimal treatment decisions in patients with advanced disease. Although the US FDA has approved one plasma-based test for detecting epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in patients with advanced stage disease, sensitivity of these assays remains mediocre, necessitating additional tissue testing and possible delays in patients with negative results. Serial monitoring for response and early detection of acquired resistance to targeted therapies is also possible with cell-free DNA, however the benefit of switching therapy prior to detection of changes on imaging is unknown currently.

AB Background: Pediatric cardiac intensive care unit rounds require high levels of efficiency in data transfer and decision making to achieve optimal performance. Traditional survey methods do not discriminate and prioritize effectively the elements of rounds essential to a provider. In this study, we describe our experience with a novel survey method (Kano analysis) to assess customers' (surgeons, intensivists, cardiologists, advanced practice nurses, and nurses) requirements from rounds.; Methods: A 26-point survey divided into 3 domains (presentation, decision, and process elements) was conducted among Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) providers. Based on the survey, attractive, must be, performance, indifferent, and reverse categories were identified using methods described in the literature. Average satisfaction and dissatisfaction coefficients and percentages of attractive and mandatory elements in subgroups were compared. Results from the quantitative analysis were charted on a categorization plane.; Results: The survey was returned by all providers with 96% valid responses. The highest satisfaction coefficient in the presentation domain was for "one line statement about the patient" (0.76), in the decision domain "rhythm/anti-arrhythmics" (0.54), and in the process domain "reformatting presentation script" (0.77). The highest dissatisfaction gradients were for "overnight events" (-0.91), "rhythm/anti-arrhythmics" (-0.71), and "asking families to join rounds" (-0.49). Among the 5 subgroups, surgeons required the largest percentage of items as mandatory or attractive and had the highest dissatisfaction coefficients in all 3 categories.; Conclusion: Kano survey can provide rapid and precise actionable data to restructure a new process. Further research potentially also involving patients and families in the Kano survey may provide insight on patient-centered care models.

AB BACKGROUND: How some organizations improve while others remain stagnant is a key question in health care research. Studies identifying how organizations can implement improvement despite barriers are needed, particularly in primary care.; PURPOSES: This inductive qualitative study examines primary care clinics implementing improvement efforts in order to identify mechanisms that enable implementation despite common barriers, such as lack of time and fragmentation across stakeholder groups.; METHODOLOGY: Using an embedded multiple case study design, we leverage a longitudinal data set of field notes, meeting minutes, and interviews from 16 primary care clinics implementing improvement over 15 months. We segment clinics into those that implemented more versus those that implemented less, comparing similarities and differences. We identify interpersonal mechanisms promoting implementation, develop a conceptual model of our key findings, and test the relationship with performance using patient surveys conducted pre-/post-implementation.; FINDINGS: Nine clinics implemented more successfully over the study period, whereas seven implemented less. Successfully implementing clinics exhibited the managerial practice of integrating, which we define as achieving unity of effort among stakeholder groups in the pursuit of a shared and mutually developed goal. We theorize that integrating is critical in improvement implementation because of the fragmentation observed in health care settings, and we extend theory about clinic managers' role in implementation. We identify four integrating mechanisms that clinic managers enacted: engaging groups, bridging communication, sensemaking, and negotiating. The mean patient survey results for integrating clinics improved by 0.07 units over time, whereas the other clinics' survey scores declined by 0.08 units on a scale of 5 (p = .02).; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our research explores an understudied element of how clinics can implement improvement despite barriers: integrating stakeholders within and outside the clinic into the process. It provides clinic managers with an actionable path for implementing improvement.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many urologic treatments have similar clinical outcomes, necessitating alternative methods to discriminate between options. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have become the new standard for evaluating the patient experience, and their use has drastically increased over the past decade. The purpose of this review is to discuss the status of PROMs in urology, highlight commonly used tools and address their future direction.; RECENT FINDINGS: An increasing number of urology-specific PROMs tools have been developed and validated. An increased focus on patient-centered care has provided an impetus for their rise in use. Implementation of PROMs has transitioned from being primarily descriptive in nature to producing actionable findings. Many PROMs are now implemented in daily clinical practice. The future of PROMs will involve new instrument development, integration into clinical practice and the use of PROMs as performance measures.; SUMMARY: PROMs are effective tools for characterizing symptom burden and health-related quality of life. With increasing clinical implementation, PROMs are playing an increasing role in patients' clinical decision-making.

AB PURPOSE: Molecular profiling performed in the research setting usually does not benefit the patients that donate their tissues. Through a prospective protocol, we sought to determine the feasibility and utility of performing broad genomic testing in the research laboratory for discovery, and the utility of giving treating physicians access to research data, with the option of validating actionable alterations in the CLIA environment.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 1200 patients with advanced cancer underwent characterization of their tumors with high depth hybrid capture sequencing of 201 genes in the research setting. Tumors were also tested in the CLIA laboratory, with a standardized hotspot mutation analysis on an 11, 46 or 50 gene platform.; RESULTS: 527 patients (44%) had at least one likely somatic mutation detected in an actionable gene using hotspot testing. With the 201 gene panel, 945 patients (79%) had at least one alteration in a potentially actionable gene that was undetected with the more limited CLIA panel testing. Sixty-four genomic alterations identified on the research panel were subsequently tested using an orthogonal CLIA assay. Of 16 mutations tested in the CLIA environment, 12 (75%) were confirmed. Twenty-five (52%) of 48 copy number alterations were confirmed. Nine (26.5%) of 34 patients with confirmed results received genotype-matched therapy. Seven of these patients were enrolled onto genotype-matched targeted therapy trials.; CONCLUSION: Expanded cancer gene sequencing identifies more actionable genomic alterations. The option of CLIA validating research results can provide alternative targets for personalized cancer therapy.

AB Deficient mismatch repair (MMR) and microsatellite instability (MSI) contribute to ~15% of colorectal cancer (CRCs). We hypothesized MSI leads to mutations in DNA repair proteins including BRCA2 and cancer drivers including EGFR. We analyzed mutations among a discovery cohort of 26 MSI-High (MSI-H) and 558 non-MSI-H CRCs profiled at Caris Life Sciences. Caris-profiled MSI-H CRCs had high mutation rates (50% vs 14% in non-MSI-H, P < 0.0001) in BRCA2. Of 1104 profiled CRCs from a second cohort (COSMIC), MSH2/MLH1-mutant CRCs showed higher mutation rates in BRCA2 compared to non-MSH2/MLH1-mutant tumors (38% vs 6%, P < 0.0000001). BRCA2 mutations in MSH2/MLH1-mutant CRCs included 75 unique mutations not known to occur in breast or pancreatic cancer per COSMIC v73. Only 5 deleterious BRCA2 mutations in CRC were previously reported in the BIC database as germ-line mutations in breast cancer. Some BRCA2 mutations were predicted to disrupt interactions with partner proteins DSS1 and RAD51. Some CRCs harbored multiple BRCA2 mutations. EGFR was mutated in 45.5% of MSH2/MLH1-mutant and 6.5% of non-MSH2/MLH1-mutant tumors (P < 0.0000001). Approximately 15% of EGFR mutations found may be actionable through TKI therapy, including N700D, G719D, T725M, T790M, and E884K. NTRK gene mutations were identified in MSH2/MLH1-mutant CRC including NTRK1 I699V, NTRK2 P716S, and NTRK3 R745L. Our findings have clinical relevance regarding therapeutic targeting of BRCA2 vulnerabilities, EGFR mutations or other identified oncogenic drivers such as NTRK in MSH2/MLH1-mutant CRCs or other tumors with mismatch repair deficiency.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the therapeutic care of patients by allowing high-throughput and parallel sequencing of large numbers of genes in a single run. However, most of available commercialized cancer panels target a large number of mutations that do not have direct therapeutic implications and that are not fully adapted to low quality formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Here, we designed an amplicon-based NGS panel assay of 16 currently actionable genes according to the most recent recommendations of the French National Cancer Institute (NCI). We developed a panel of short amplicons (<150 bp) using dual-strand library preparation. The clinical validation of this panel was performed on well-characterized controls and 140 routine diagnostic samples, including highly degraded and cross-linked genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tumor samples. All mutations were detected with elevated inter-laboratory and inter-run reproducibility. Importantly, we could detect clinically actionable alterations in FFPE samples with variant allele frequencies as low as 1%. In addition, the overall molecular diagnosis rate was increased from 40.7% with conventional techniques to 59.2% with our NGS panel, including 41 novel actionable alterations normally not explored by conventional techniques. Taken together, we believe that this new actionable target panel represents a relevant, highly scalable and robust tool that is easy to implement and is fully adapted to daily clinical practice in hospital and academic laboratories.

AB BACKGROUND: Brief interventions can reduce alcohol consumption in young people through screening and delivery of personally relevant feedback. Recently, Web and mobile platforms have been harnessed to increase the reach of brief interventions. Existing literature on mobile-based alcohol brief interventions indicates mixed use of theory in developing interventions. There is no research available to guide the development of SMS text messaging (short message service, SMS) interventions delivered during risky drinking events.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and pilot an alcohol-related risk-reduction brief intervention delivered by SMS to Australian young adults during drinking events. This paper describes the development of intervention message content, with specific focus on the context of delivery during drinking events.; METHODS: A sample of 42 young adults attended 4 workshops; these comprised focus-group style discussion on drinking habits and motivations, discussion of intervention design, analysis of existing alcohol media campaigns, and participant development of message content. Data were analyzed thematically.; RESULTS: Participants described a focus on having fun and blocking out any incongruent negative influences during drinking episodes. For content to be acceptable, nonjudgmental and non-authoritative language was deemed essential. A preference for short, actionable messages was observed, including suggestions for reminders around drinking water, organizing transport home, checking on friends, and plans the next day. Participants were excited about the potential for messages to be tailored to individuals, as previous alcohol-related campaigns were deemed too generic and often irrelevant. Normative-based messages were also perceived as largely irrelevant as participants felt that they understood the drinking-related norms of their immediate peers already.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study offer insights into young adults' drinking events and practical advice for designing alcohol-related brief interventions. During our formative development process, we demonstrated a neat correspondence between young people's preferences for alcohol harm reduction interventions and the theoretical principles of brief interventions, including acceptable topics and message style. ©Cassandra J C Wright, Paul M Dietze, Megan S C Lim.

AB BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of hospitalization in older adults and high readmission rates have attracted considerable attention as actionable targets to promote efficiency in care and to reduce costs. Despite a plethora of research over the past decade, current strategies to predict readmissions have been largely ineffective and efforts to identify novel clinical predictors have been largely unsuccessful.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine a wide array of socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, and clinical factors to predict risks of 30-day hospital readmission in cardiovascular patients.; METHODS: The study includes patients (aged 18 years and older) admitted for the treatment of cardiovascular-related illnesses at the Duke Heart Center, which is among the nation's largest and top-ranked cardiovascular care hospitals. The study uses a novel standardized survey to ascertain data on a comprehensive array of patient characteristics that will be linked to their electronic medical records. A series of univariate and multivariate models will be used to estimate the associations between the patient-level factors and 30-day readmissions. The performance of the risk models will be examined based on 2 components of accuracy-model calibration and discrimination-to determine how closely the predicted outcome agrees with the observed (actual) outcome and how well the model distinguishes patients who were readmitted and those who were not. The purpose of this paper is to present the protocol for the implementation of this study.; RESULTS: The study was launched in February 2014 and is actively recruiting patients from the Heart Center. Approximately 550 patients have been enrolled to date and the study is expected to continue recruitment until February 2018. Preliminary results show that participants in the study were aged 63.6 years on average (SD 14.0), predominately male (61.2%), and primarily non-Hispanic white (64.6%) or non-Hispanic black (31.7%). The demographic characteristics of study participants were not significantly different from all patients admitted to the Heart Center during this period with an average age of 65.0 years (SD 15.3) and predominately male (58.6%), non-Hispanic white (62.9%) or non-Hispanic black (31.8%) The integration of the interview data with clinical data from the patient electronic medical records is currently underway. The study has received funding and ethical approval.; CONCLUSIONS: Many US hospitals continue to struggle with high readmission rates in patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary objective of this study is to collect and integrate a comprehensive array of patient attributes to develop a powerful yet parsimonious model to stratify risks of rehospitalization in cardiovascular patients. The results of this research also have the potential to identify actionable targets for tailored interventions to improve patient outcomes. ©Matthew E Dupre, Alicia Nelson, Scott M Lynch, Bradi B Granger, Hanzhang Xu, Janese M Willis, Lesley H Curtis, Eric D Peterson.

AB BACKGROUND: There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration approved molecularly matched therapies for sarcomas except gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Complicating this is the extreme diversity, heterogeneity, and rarity of these neoplasms. Few therapeutic options exist for relapsed and refractory sarcomas. In clinical practice many oncologists refer patients for genomic profiling hoping for guidance on treatment options after standard therapy. However, a systematic analysis of actionable mutations has yet to be completed. We analyzed genomic profiling results in patients referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center with advanced sarcomas to elucidate the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in this population.; METHODS: We reviewed charts of patients with advanced sarcoma who were referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 236 or 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng of DNA. Actionable alterations were defined as those identifying anti-cancer drugs on the market, in registered clinical trials, or in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database.; RESULTS: Among the 102 patients analyzed median age was 45.5 years (range 8-76), M: F ratio 48:54. The most common subtypes seen in our study were leiomyosarcoma (18.6%), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (11%), osteosarcoma (11%), well-differentiated liposarcoma (7%), carcinosarcoma (6%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (6%). Ninety-five out of 102 patients (93%) had at least one genomic alteration identified with a mean of six mutations per patient. Of the 95 biopsy samples with identifiable genomic alterations, the most commonly affected genes were TP53 (31.4%), CDK4 (23.5%), MDM2 (21.6%), RB1 (18.6%), and CDKN2A/B (13.7%). Notable co-segregating amplifications included MDM2-CDK4 and FRS2-FGF. Sixteen percent of patients received targeted therapy based on CGP of which 50% had at least stable disease.; CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating CGP into sarcoma management may allow for more precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease, as well as personalized matching of patients to targeted therapies such as those available in basket clinical trials.

AB Predictive biomarkers have the potential to facilitate cancer precision medicine by guiding the optimal choice of therapies for patients. However, clinicians are faced with an enormous volume of often-contradictory evidence regarding the therapeutic context of chemopredictive biomarkers.We extensively surveyed public literature to systematically review the predictive effect of 7 biomarkers claimed to predict response to various chemotherapy drugs: ERCC1-platinums, RRM1-gemcitabine, TYMS-5-fluorouracil/Capecitabine, TUBB3-taxanes, MGMT-temozolomide, TOP1-irinotecan/topotecan, and TOP2A-anthracyclines. We focused on studies that investigated changes in gene or protein expression as predictors of drug sensitivity or resistance. We considered an evidence framework that ranked studies from high level I evidence for randomized controlled trials to low level IV evidence for pre-clinical studies and patient case studies.We found that further in-depth analysis will be required to explore methodological issues, inconsistencies between studies, and tumor specific effects present even within high evidence level studies. Some of these nuances will lend themselves to automation, others will require manual curation. However, the comprehensive cataloging and analysis of dispersed public data utilizing an evidence framework provides a high level perspective on clinical actionability of these protein biomarkers. This framework and perspective will ultimately facilitate clinical trial design as well as therapeutic decision-making for individual patients.

AB We investigated what information women diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age would want to learn when genome sequencing results are returned. We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or younger. We examined what specific information participants would want to learn across result types and for each type of result, as well as how much information they would want. Genome sequencing was not offered to participants as part of the study. Two coders independently coded interview transcripts; analysis was conducted using NVivo10. Across result types, participants wanted to learn about health implications, risk and prevalence in quantitative terms, causes of variants, and causes of diseases. Participants wanted to learn actionable information for variants affecting risk of preventable or treatable disease, medication response, and carrier status. The amount of desired information differed for variants affecting risk of unpreventable or untreatable disease, with uncertain significance, and not health-related. Women diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age recognize the value of genome sequencing results in identifying potential causes and effective treatments and expressed interest in using the information to help relatives and to further understand their other health risks. Our findings can inform the development of effective feedback strategies for genome sequencing that meet patients' information needs and preferences.

AB Despite improvements in operative management and therapies, overall survival rates in advanced ovarian cancer have remained largely unchanged over the past three decades. Although it is possible to identify high-risk patients following surgery, the knowledge does not provide information about the genomic aberrations conferring risk, or the implications for treatment. To address these challenges, we developed an integrative pathway-index model and applied it to messenger RNA expression from 458 patients with serous ovarian carcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas project. The biomarker derived from this approach, IPI59, contains 59 genes from six pathways. As we demonstrate using independent datasets from six studies, IPI59 is strongly associated with overall and progression-free survival, and also identifies high-risk patients who may benefit from enhanced adjuvant therapy.

AB The historical approach of diagnosing cancer types based entirely on anatomic origin and histologic features, and the "one-size-fit-all" therapeutic approach, are inadequate in modern cancer treatment. From decades of research we now know that cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease driven by complex genetic or epigenetic alterations. The advent of various high throughput molecular tools has now enabled us to view and sub-classify each cancer type based on their distinct molecular features, in addition to histologic classification, with the promise of individualized treatment strategies tailored towards each specific subtype to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we have made an effort to systematically review the most up-to-date, leading literature in molecular analysis and/or subtyping of major gastrointestinal cancers. These include esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer (GC) adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gallbladder cancer (GBC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). For each cancer type we summarized the global mutational landscape, subgroup classification based on genomics, epigenetics, gene expression and/or proteomic analysis, and their salient clinicopathological features. We have highlighted the actionable mutations or mutational pathways that could help guide targeted therapies in the future.

AB The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has advanced our understanding of the intrinsic biology of different gastrointestinal (GI) tumor types. The use of novel, more efficient sequencing platforms has improved turnaround times of sequencing results. This is providing real time opportunities to put precision medicine to the test. A number of early phase clinical trials are testing targeted therapies in unique molecularly characterized subsets of patients (baskets). While basket studies are gaining momentum, treatment failures serve to remind us that shifting from a histology-driven to a histology-agnostic approach is unlikely to be a failure-free strategy for a number of tumor types as recently learnt from vemurafenib failure in BRAF mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). GI malignancies are clinically and molecularly heterogeneous. Unfortunately, development of biomarkers of response to therapy as well as targeted therapies for GI adenocarcinomas has fallen behind compared to other malignancies. Trastuzumab is the only FDA approved targeted therapy for GI adenocarcinomas for which a biomarker of response (HER2 amplifications) is available. In addition, RAS mutations are known to predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, NGS has recently revealed that a number of actionable genetic aberrations are present at low prevalence across different GI malignancies. Prospective randomized clinical trials will determine whether matching actionable aberration with targeted therapy will contribute to improve survival in patients with GI malignancies. Here, we review current evidence for targeted therapies in GI malignancies, as well as application and pitfalls of NGS including tissue testing and liquid biopsies.

AB Despite increasing prominence, little is known about the cognitive processes underlying shared decision making. To investigate these processes, we conceptualize shared decision making as a form of distributed cognition. We introduce a Decision Space Model to identify physical and social influences on decision making. Using field observations and interviews, we demonstrate that patients and physicians in both acute and chronic care consider these influences when identifying the need for a decision, searching for decision parameters, making actionable decisions Based on the distribution of access to information and actions, we then identify four related patterns: physician dominated; physician-defined, patient-made; patient-defined, physician-made; and patient-dominated decisions. Results suggests that (a) decision making is necessarily distributed between physicians and patients, (b) differential access to information and action over time requires participants to transform a distributed task into a shared decision, and (c) adverse outcomes may result from failures to integrate physician and patient reasoning. Our analysis unifies disparate findings in the medical decision-making literature and has implications for improving care and medical training.

AB In studies of the molecular basis of gastric cancer (GC), microsatellite instability (MSI) is one of the key factors. Somatic mutations found in GC are expected to contribute to MSI-high (H) tumorigenesis. We estimated somatic mutation distribution according to MSI status in 52 matched pair GC samples using the Ion Torrent Ion S5 XL with the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot panel.Seventy-five (9.8%) somatic variants consisting of 34 hotspot mutations and 41 other likely pathogenic variants were identified in 34 GC samples. The TP53 mutations was most common (35%, 26/75), followed by EGFR (8%, 6/75), HNF1A (8%, 6/75), PIK3CA (8%, 6/75), and ERBB2 (5%, 4/75). To determine MSI status, 52 matched pair samples were estimated using 15 MSI markers. Thirty-nine MS stable (S), 5 MSI-low (L), and 8 MSI-H were classified. GCs with MSI-H tended to have more variants significantly compared with GCs with MS stable (MSS) and MSI-L (standardized J-T statistic  =  3.161 for number of variants; P  =  .002). The mean number of all variants and hotspot mutations per tumor samples only in GCs with MSI-H were 3.9 (range, 1-6) and 1.1 (range, 0-3), respectively. Whereas, the mean number of all variants and hotspot mutations per tumor samples only in GCs with MSS/MSI-L were 1 (0-5)/0.8 (0-1) and 0.5 (0-3)/0.8 (0-1), respectively.In conclusion, GC with MSI-H harbored more mutations in genes that act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene compared to GC with MSS/MSI-L. This finding suggests that the accumulation of MSIs contributes to the genetic diversity and complexities of GC. In addition, targeted NGS approach allows for detection of common and also rare clinically actionable mutations and profiles of comutations in multiple patients simultaneously. Because GC shows distinctive patterns related to ethnics, further studies pertaining to different racial/ethnic groups or cancer types may reinforce our investigations.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive diagnostic procedures such as needle-core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration provide adequate material for molecular analyses. Advances in precision oncology are trending toward the interrogation of limited amounts of genomic material to guide clinical and therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate the minimum cellularity needed on cytologic smears for the identification of clinically relevant variants with next-generation sequencing (NGS).; METHODS: Thirty cases of cytologically diagnosed, resection-proven primary lung adenocarcinoma were identified. Nineteen of the 30 cases were known to harbor actionable variants. One Diff-Quik (DQ)-stained slide and 1 Papanicolaou (Pap)-stained slide were selected from each case. Cases were categorized as containing fewer than 100 tumor cells, 100 to 500 tumor cells, or more than 500 tumor cells. NGS was performed on the Ion Torrent platform.; RESULTS: NGS was successfully performed on all cell blocks and on 90% of the smears. Paired DQ and Pap smears showed similar cellularity, and cases that differed in cellularity were within 1 category of each other. The cases with more than 100 tumor cells had a 93% success rate; this was significantly different from the situation for cases with fewer than 100 tumor cells, which were successfully sequenced only 67% of the time. Overall, NGS was able to provide clinically relevant information for 83% of DQ smears and for 90% of Pap smears tested.; CONCLUSIONS: The data show a significantly higher likelihood of successful NGS with cytologic smears with more than 100 tumor cells. There was a trend for a higher NGS success rate with Pap smears versus DQ smears. Cancer Cytopathol 2017;125:398-406. © 2017 American Cancer Society. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

AB Communication between cytopathologists and patients and their care team is a critical component of accurate and timely patient management. The most important single means of communication for the cytopathologist is through the cytopathology report. Implementation of standardized terminology schemes and structured, templated reporting facilitates the ability of the cytopathologist to provide a comprehensive and integrated report. Cytopathology has been among the pathology subspecialties that have led the way in developing standardized reporting, beginning with the 1954 Papanicolaou classification scheme for cervical-vaginal cytology and continuing through the Bethesda systems for gynecological cytology and several nongynecological cytology systems. The effective reporting of cytopathology necessarily becomes more complex as it addresses increasingly sophisticated management options, requiring the integration of information from a broader range of sources. In addition to the complexity of information inputs, a wider spectrum of consumers of these reports is emerging, from patients themselves to primary care providers to subspecialized disease management experts. Both these factors require that the reporting cytopathologist provide the integration and interpretation necessary to translate diverse forms of information into meaningful and actionable reports that will inform the care team while enabling the patient to meaningfully participate in his or her own care. To achieve such broad and focused communications will require first the development of standardized and integrated reports and ultimately the involvement of cytopathologists in the development of the clinical informatics needed to treat all these items of information as structured data elements with flexible reporting operators to address the full range of patient and patient care needs.

AB Importance: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States in all ethnic and racial groups. The overall death rate from lung cancer is higher in black patients than in white patients.; Objective: To compare the prevalence and types of somatic alterations between lung cancers from black patients and white patients. Differences in mutational frequencies could illuminate differences in prognosis and lead to the reduction of outcome disparities by more precisely targeting patients' treatment.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Tumor specimens were collected from Baptist Cancer Center (Memphis, Tennessee) over the course of 9 years (January 2004-December 2012). Genomic analysis by massively parallel sequencing of 504 cancer genes was performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, Massachusetts). Overall, 509 lung cancer tumors specimens (319 adenocarcinomas; 142 squamous cell carcinomas) were profiled from 245 black patients and 264 white patients.; Main Outcomes and Measures: The frequencies of genomic alterations were compared between tumors from black and white populations.; Results: Overall, 509 lung cancers were collected and analyzed (273 women [129 black patients; 144 white patients] and 236 men [116 black patients; 120 white patients]). Using 313 adenocarcinomas and 138 squamous cell carcinomas with genetically supported ancestry, overall mutational frequencies and copy number changes were not significantly different between black and white populations in either tumor type after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. Furthermore, specific activating alterations in members of the receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/Raf pathway including EGFR and KRAS were not significantly different between populations in lung adenocarcinoma.; Conclusions and Relevance: These results demonstrate that lung cancers from black patients are similar to cancers from white patients with respect to clinically actionable genomic alterations and suggest that clinical trials of targeted therapies could significantly benefit patients in both groups.

AB BACKGROUND/AIMS: The Food and Drug Administration's final rule on investigational new drug application safety reporting, effective from 28 March 2011, clarified the reporting requirements for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions occurring in clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative released recommendations in 2013 to assist implementation of the final rule; however, anecdotal reports and data from a Food and Drug Administration audit indicated that a majority of reports being submitted were still uninformative and did not result in actionable changes. Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative investigated remaining barriers and potential solutions to full implementation of the final rule by polling and interviewing investigators, clinical research staff, and sponsors.; METHODS: In an opinion-gathering effort, two discrete online surveys designed to assess challenges and motivations related to management of expedited (7- to 15-day) investigational new drug safety reporting processes in oncology trials were developed and distributed to two populations: investigators/clinical research staff and sponsors. Data were collected for approximately 1year. Twenty-hour-long interviews were also conducted with Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative-nominated interview participants who were considered as having extensive knowledge of and experience with the topic. Interviewees included 13 principal investigators/study managers/research team members and 7 directors/vice presidents of pharmacovigilance operations from 5 large global pharmaceutical companies.; RESULTS: The investigative site's responses indicate that too many individual reports are still being submitted, which are time-consuming to process and provide little value for patient safety assessments or for informing actionable changes. Fewer but higher quality reports would be more useful, and the investigator and staff would benefit from sponsors'"filtering" of reports and increased sponsor communication. Sponsors replied that their greatest challenges include (1) lack of global harmonization in reporting rules, (2) determining causality, and (3) fear of regulatory repercussions. Interaction with the Food and Drug Administration has helped improve sponsors' adherence to the final rule, and sponsors would benefit from increased communication with the Food and Drug Administration and educational materials.; CONCLUSION: The goal of the final rule is to minimize uninformative safety reports so that important safety signals can be captured and communicated early enough in a clinical program to make changes that help ensure patient safety. Investigative staff and sponsors acknowledge that the rule has not been fully implemented although they agree with the intention. Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative will use the results from the surveys and interviews to develop new recommendations and educational materials that will be available to sponsors to increase compliance with the final rule and facilitate discussion between sponsors, investigators, and Food and Drug Administration representatives.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers to hydroxyurea adherence (negative beliefs, access, and/or recall barriers), and their relationship to adherence rates and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD).; METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 34 AYAs (12-22years old) in SCD clinics from January to December 2015. Study measures included Brief Medication Questionnaire, Modified Morisky Adherence Scale 8-items, visual analog scale, and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.; RESULTS: Participants (59% male; 91% Black) had a median age of 13.5years (IQR 12-18). Participants reported negative beliefs (32%), recall barriers (44%), and access barriers (32%). Participants with recall barriers reported worse pain (P=.02), fatigue (P=.05), and depression (P=.05). The number of adherence barriers inversely correlated with adherence level using ©MMAS-8 (rs =-.38, P=.02) and VASdose (rs =-.25, P=.14) as well as MCV (rs =-.45, P=.01) and HbF% (rs =-.36, P=.05), suggesting higher hydroxyurea adherence in patients with fewer barriers.; CONCLUSIONS: Patients with fewer barriers to hydroxyurea adherence were more likely to have higher adherence rates and better HRQOL scores. Routine assessment of hydroxyurea adherence and its related barriers could provide actionable information to improve adherence rates, HRQOL, and other clinical outcomes. © 2017 The Authors.

AB INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic to Southern China and Asia and is etiologically associated with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Whole exome and genome sequencing (WES, WGS) studies of NPC have reported several actionable therapeutic targets, and that the mutational load of NPC maybe comparable to that of squamous head and neck cancer. These unique biological characteristics have been exploited as potential targets and a wide range of investigational drugs are being investigated in clinical trials. Area covered: This review focused on the latest clinical development of the most promising classes of investigational agents in the treatment of advanced NPC. These include inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis, kinase signaling pathways and immunotherapy. Expert opinion: Checkpoint inhibitors and EBV-specific T-cell therapy have shown promising activity in early phase clinical trials, and are being further evaluated in randomized studies. For patients whose tumors express genetic alterations that are known to predict response to kinase inhibitors, novel trial designs such as an 'Umbrella' study may be considered given the abundance of targeted agents that are now available for clinical evaluation. It is envisioned that regulatory approval for new drugs for advanced NPC will occur in the near future.

AB A major objective of 'omics' technologies is to understand genetic causality of complex traits of human diseases. High-throughput omics technologies and their application to medicine open up remarkable opportunities for realising optimised medical treatment for individuals. Because many major breakthrough and discoveries in this field have been driven by the development of new omics technologies, in this review, the authors aim to provide an in-depth description of their underlying principles as a foundation of developing another new omics technology, and to introduce their emerging applications for personalised medicine. The systems biology approach is then introduced as a future direction towards actionable personalised medicine.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Postoperative respiratory complications (PRCs) increase hospitalization time, 30-day mortality and costs by up to $35 000. These outcomes measures have gained prominence as bundled payments have become more common.; RECENT FINDINGS: Results of recent quantitative effectiveness studies and clinical trials provide a framework that helps develop center-specific treatment guidelines, tailored to minimize the risk of PRCs. The implementation of those protocols should be guided by a local, respected, and visible facilitator who leads proper implementation while inviting center-specific input from surgeons, anesthesiologists, and other perioperative stakeholders.; SUMMARY: Preoperatively, patients should be risk-stratified for PRCs to individualize intraoperative choices and postoperative pathways. Laparoscopic compared with open surgery improves respiratory outcomes. High-risk patients should be treated by experienced providers based on locally developed bundle-interventions to optimize intraoperative treatment and ICU bed utilization. Intraoperatively, lung-protective ventilation (procedure-specific positive end-expiratory pressure utilization, and low driving pressure) and moderately restrictive fluid therapy should be used. To achieve surgical relaxation, high-dose neuromuscular blocking agents (and reversal agents) as well as high-dose opioids should be avoided; inhaled anesthetics improve surgical conditions while protecting the lungs. Patients should be extubated in reverse Trendelenburg position. Postoperatively, continuous positive airway pressure helps prevent airway collapse and protocolized, early mobilization improves cognitive and respiratory function.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of testing actionable mutations in small amounts of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material in multiple genes of the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway and to determine the frequency of these mutations in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).; DESIGN: A retrospective pilot study was performed.; SETTING: In OPC, no predictive markers for response to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition are known. Therefore, identifying predictive biomarkers is of utmost importance, but is often hampered by the small amount of tumour material available.; PARTICIPANTS: We included the archival material of 45 OPC, all treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy between 2003 and 2010.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Besides the HPV status, we assessed mutations using a gene panel that targets 16 genes in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway and six other genes. The polymerase chain reaction required only 10 ng DNA.; RESULTS: In total, 42 of the 45 biopsies have been successfully analysed. In total 20 of 42 samples were HPV-positive and 22 of 42 were HPV-negative. In the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, mutations in PIK3CA were most frequently identified. A TP53 mutation was identified in one HPV-positive sample and in 13 HPV-negative samples. Additionally, three mutations in three different genes were found.; CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated an assay to identify mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. As only small amounts of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material are sufficient for reliable analysis, this test opens up new possibilities for personalised medicine. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Spina bifida is a serious and largely preventable neural tube birth defect and an important cause of mortality and lifelong disability. The People and Organizations United for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (PUSH!) Global Alliance was formed in 2014 to provide a common platform for various organizations worldwide to raise the visibility of spina bifida and hydrocephalus. In its formative phase, the alliance recognized that in order to accelerate surveillance, prevention, and care for these conditions, there was a need to provide an evidence-based assessment of how nations are performing in specific areas. In this paper, we describe the impetus for, and the process of, developing country-level scorecards for spina bifida surveillance, prevention and care. The PUSH! Executive Committee formulated a comprehensive list of six actionable indicators measuring availability of published studies on population-based folate studies; surveillance of prevalence and mortality; prevention-based policies; access to care; and quality of life associated with spina bifida. Rubrics were developed to score each country on the aforementioned indicators. Country scores were pooled across each indicator and the composite scores ranged between zero and three if there was a need for improvement, four and five if they were in good standing, or six for an excellent status. The scorecard included country-specific recommendations assimilated from the literature and published guidelines to aid policy makers in accelerating surveillance and prevention, and improving the care and quality of life indicators. For comparison, country-level scorecards were grouped by WHO-regions. Score cards were made available publicly through the website "www.pu-sh.org". Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a need for a clear and actionable definition of maternal sepsis, in order to better assess the burden of this condition, trigger timely and effective treatment and allow comparisons across facilities and countries. The objective of this study was to review maternal sepsis definitions and identification criteria and to report on the results of an expert consultation to develop a new international definition of maternal sepsis.; METHODS: All original and review articles and WHO documents, as well as clinical guidelines providing definitions and/or identification criteria of maternal sepsis were included. A multidisciplinary international panel of experts was surveyed through an online consultation in March-April 2016 on their opinion on the existing sepsis definitions, including new definition of sepsis proposed for the adult population (2016 Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock) and importance of different criteria for identification of maternal sepsis. The definition was agreed using an iterative process in an expert face-to-face consensus development meeting convened by WHO and Jhpiego.; RESULTS: Standardizing the definition of maternal sepsis and aligning it with the current understanding of sepsis in the adult population was considered a mandatory step to improve the assessment of the burden of maternal sepsis by the expert panel. The literature review and expert consultation resulted in a new WHO consensus definition "Maternal sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during pregnancy, child-birth, post-abortion, or post-partum period". Plans are in progress to validate the new WHO definition of maternal sepsis in a large international population.; CONCLUSION: The operationalization of the new maternal sepsis definition requires generation of a set of practical criteria to identify women with sepsis. These criteria should enable clinicians to focus on the timely initiation of actionable elements of care (administration of antimicrobials and fluids, support of vital organ functions, and referral) and improve maternal outcomes.

AB Precision medicine requires accurate multi-gene clinical diagnostics. We describe the implementation of an Illumina TruSight Tumor (TST) clinical NGS diagnostic framework and parallel validation of a NanoString RNA-based ALK, RET, and ROS1 gene fusion assay for combined analysis of treatment predictive alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a regional healthcare region of Sweden (Scandinavia). The TST panel was clinically validated in 81 tumors (99% hotspot mutation concordance), after which 533 consecutive NSCLCs were collected during one-year of routine clinical analysis in the healthcare region (~90% advanced stage patients). The NanoString assay was evaluated in 169 of 533 cases. In the 533-sample cohort 79% had 1-2 variants, 12% >2 variants and 9% no detected variants. Ten gene fusions (five ALK, three RET, two ROS1) were detected in 135 successfully analyzed cases (80% analysis success rate). No ALK or ROS1 FISH fusion positive case was missed by the NanoString assay. Stratification of the 533-sample cohort based on actionable alterations in 11 oncogenes revealed that 66% of adenocarcinomas, 13% of squamous carcinoma (SqCC) and 56% of NSCLC not otherwise specified harbored ≥1 alteration. In adenocarcinoma, 10.6% of patients (50.3% if including KRAS) could potentially be eligible for emerging therapeutics, in addition to the 15.3% of patients eligible for standard EGFR or ALK inhibitors. For squamous carcinoma corresponding proportions were 4.4% (11.1% with KRAS) vs 2.2%. In conclusion, multiplexed NGS and gene fusion analyses are feasible in NSCLC for clinical diagnostics, identifying notable proportions of patients potentially eligible for emerging molecular therapeutics.

AB BACKGROUND: Medication adherence remains a difficult problem to both assess and improve in patients. It is a multifactorial problem that goes beyond the commonly cited reason of forgetfulness. To date, eHealth (also known as mHealth and telehealth) interventions to improve medication adherence have largely been successful in improving adherence. However, interventions to date have used time- and cost-intensive strategies or focused solely on medication reminding, leaving much room for improvement in using a modality as flexible as eHealth.; OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop and implement a fully automated short message service (SMS)-based medication adherence system, EpxMedTracking, that reminds patients to take their medications, explores reasons for missed doses, and alerts providers to help address problems of medication adherence in real time.; METHODS: EpxMedTracking is a fully automated bidirectional SMS-based messaging system with provider involvement that was developed and implemented through Epharmix, Inc. Researchers analyzed 11 weeks of de-identified data from patients cared for by multiple provider groups in routine community practice for feasibility and functionality. Patients included were those in the care of a provider purchasing the EpxMedTracking tool from Epharmix and were enrolled from a clinic by their providers. The primary outcomes assessed were the rate of engagement with the system, reasons for missing doses, and self-reported medication adherence.; RESULTS: Of the 25 patients studied over the 11 weeks, 3 never responded and subsequently opted out or were deleted by their provider. No other patients opted out or were deleted during the study period. Across the 11 weeks of the study period, the overall weekly engagement rate was 85.9%. There were 109 total reported missed doses including "I forgot" at 33 events (30.3%), "I felt better" at 29 events (26.6%), "out of meds" at 20 events (18.4%), "I felt sick" at 19 events (17.4%), and "other" at 3 events (2.8%). We also noted an increase in self-reported medication adherence in patients using the EpxMedTracking system.; CONCLUSIONS: EpxMedTracking is an effective tool for tracking self-reported medication adherence over time. It uniquely identifies actionable reasons for missing doses for subsequent provider intervention in real time based on patient feedback. Patients enrolled on EpxMedTracking also self-report higher rates of medication adherence over time while on the system. ©Christopher Tricarico, Robert Peters, Avik Som, Kavon Javaherian, Will Ross.

AB BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to characterize the diversity and magnitude of antimicrobial resistance among Staphylococcus species recovered from imported beef meat sold in the Egyptian market and the potential mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes including harboring of resistance genes (mecA, cfr, gyrA, gyrB, and grlA) and biofilm formation.; RESULTS: The resistance gene mecA was detected in 50% of methicillin-resistant non-Staphylococcus aureus isolates (4/8). Interestingly, our results showed that: (i) resistance genes mecA, gyrA, gyrB, grlA, and cfr were absent in Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus hemolyticus isolates, although S. hominis was phenotypically resistant to methicillin (MR-non-S. aureus) while S. hemolyticus was resistant to vancomycin only; (ii) S. aureus isolates did not carry the mecA gene (100%) and were phenotypically characterized as methicillin- susceptible S. aureus (MSS); and (iii) the resistance gene mecA was present in one isolate (1/3) of Staphylococcus lugdunensis that was phenotypically characterized as methicillin-susceptible non-S. aureus (MSNSA).; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential risk for consumers, in the absence of actionable risk management information systems, of imported foods and advice a strict implementation of international standards by different venues such as CODEX to avoid the increase in prevalence of coagulase positive and coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolates and their antibiotic resistance genes in imported beef meat at the Egyptian market.

AB BACKGROUND: Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) describes a sudden death with negative autopsy and toxicological analysis. Cardiac genetic disease is a likely etiology.; OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the clinical utility and combined yield of post-mortem genetic testing (molecular autopsy) in cases of SADS and comprehensive clinical evaluation of surviving relatives.; METHODS: We evaluated 302 expertly validated SADS cases with suitable DNA (median age: 24 years; 65% males) who underwent next-generation sequencing using an extended panel of 77 primary electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were classified using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) consensus guidelines. The yield of combined molecular autopsy and clinical evaluation in 82 surviving families was evaluated. A gene-level rare variant association analysis was conducted in SADS cases versus controls.; RESULTS: A clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 40 of 302 cases (13%). The main etiologies established were catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome (17 [6%] and 11 [4%], respectively). Gene-based rare variants association analysis showed enrichment of rare predicted deleterious variants in RYR2 (p= 5* 10-5). Combining molecular autopsy with clinical evaluation in surviving families increased diagnostic yield from 26% to 39%.; CONCLUSIONS: Molecular autopsy for electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes, using ACMG guidelines for variant classification, identified a modest but realistic yield in SADS. Our data highlighted the predominant role of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome, especially the RYR2 gene, as well as the minimal yield from other genes. Furthermore, we showed the enhanced utility of combined clinical and genetic evaluation. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Root cause analysis is a technique used to assess systems factors related to "sentinel events"-serious adverse events within healthcare systems. This technique is commonly used to identify factors, which allowed these adverse events to occur, to target areas for improvement and to improve health care delivery systems. We sought to apply this technique to men presenting with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa).; METHODS: We performed an in-depth case series analysis of 15 patients, who presented with metastatic disease at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center using root cause analysis to refine a list of health system factors that lead to late stage presentation in the current era.; RESULTS: Key factors in late diagnosis of PCa included lack of insurance, lack of routine PSA testing, comorbidities, reticence of patients to follow up actionable PSA, and aggressive disease. Three patients had aggressive disease that would not have been discovered at an early stage in the disease process, despite routine screening. However, analysis of the remaining 12 patients illuminated health system factors led to missing important diagnostic information, which might have led to diagnosis of PCa at a curable stage.; CONCLUSIONS: The cases help highlight the need for systems based approaches to early diagnosis of PCa. A heterogeneous group of barriers to early diagnosis were identified in our series of patients including economic, health systems, and cultural factors. These findings underscore the need for individualized approaches to preventing delayed diagnosis of PCa. While limited by our single-institution scope, this approach provides a model for research and quality improvement initiatives to identify modifiable systems factors impeding appropriate diagnoses of PCa. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We present a muscle-invasive high-grade metastatic urothelial carcinoma patient, aged 71 years, with rapid progression from the diagnosis and a poor prognosis after 3 lines of treatment. A clinical exhaustive genomic profile was performed with the goal of finding potential actionable molecular alterations. The patient showed significant symptomatic and laboratory improvement with a nonstandard chemotherapy combination treatment identified by the molecular profiling, which would otherwise not have been considered. This approach illustrates the clinical benefit of a comprehensive genomic analysis in an aggressive and refractory urothelial carcinoma.

AB "Precision" trials, using rationally incorporated biomarker targets and molecularly selective anticancer agents, have become of great interest to both patients and their physicians. In the endeavor to test the cornerstone premise of precision oncotherapy, that is, determining if modulating a specific molecular aberration in a patient's tumor with a correspondingly specific therapeutic agent improves clinical outcomes, the design of clinical trials with embedded genomic characterization platforms which guide therapy are an increasing challenge. The National Cancer Institute Precision Medicine Initiative is an unprecedented large interdisciplinary collaborative effort to conceptualize and test the feasibility of trials incorporating sequencing platforms and large-scale bioinformatics processing that are not currently uniformly available to patients. National Cancer Institute-Molecular Profiling-based Assignment of Cancer Therapy and National Cancer Institute-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice are 2 genomic to phenotypic trials under this National Cancer Institute initiative, where treatment is selected according to predetermined genetic alterations detected using next-generation sequencing technology across a broad range of tumor types. In this article, we discuss the objectives and trial designs that have enabled the public-private partnerships required to complete the scale of both trials, as well as interim trial updates and strategic considerations that have driven data analysis and targeted therapy assignment, with the intent of elucidating further the benefits of this treatment approach for patients.

AB Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been widely adapted in clinical oncology by utilizing the profiled genetic mutation information to select patients and to guide the choice of target therapy. To fulfill the regulatory compliance, development of an NGS assay that will be used in clinical trials requires an analytical validation to meet its intend clinical use. NCI-MATCH trial is the largest precision oncology basket trial which uses a single NGS assay (NCI-MATHC NGS assay) to screen the actionable mutations in 6000 patients, who have relapsed/refractory solid tumors and lymphomas after standard systemic treatment, and assigns matched treatment. This article reviews on the critical considerations during development and validation of NGS assays as an investigational device for genomic based clinical trials and provides the experiences from the development of NCI-MATCH NGS assay.

AB In the era of personalized medicine, tumor sampling is paramount to enable the assessment of actionable molecular aberrations to help rationalize and guide treatment decisions. Longitudinal tracking of such aberrations may also be helpful to detect emerging drug resistance and to allow for timely modifications to ongoing therapies to improve patient outcomes. Nevertheless, tumor tissue sampling involves an invasive procedure with potential risks to patients and involves logistical challenges. As such, other less invasive and safer methods such as blood sampling for molecular profiling has been gaining traction. In this article, we discuss the concept of circulating tumor DNA, the technology platforms available for its interrogation, and its current applications in the clinic. We also envision how circulating tumor DNA may be applied at multiple time points along a patient's cancer journey to guide diagnosis, prognostication, and therapeutic decisions.

AB While more than a billion people live at risk of neglected tropical diseases in areas of Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, the degree to which such diseases burden countries like the United States is currently unclear. Even though many neglected tropical diseases such as dengue, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease are not endemic to the United States, the possibility of their emergence is noteworthy, especially in states like Texas, which has high levels of poverty, a large immigrant population, and a climate amenable to the vectors for these diseases and is geographically proximate to endemic areas. Despite the health threat that emerging neglected tropical diseases may pose, little is known about the prevalence of risk factors for them in the United States. Texas House Bill 2055, enacted on September 1, 2015, mandated the establishment of a surveillance program for neglected tropical diseases in Texas. After reviewing the potential risk factors for transmission in Texas, we developed a 41-question survey that could be implemented using the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) method. In concert with public health surveillance and vector population monitoring, data from CASPERs could be used to quickly and cost-effectively assess the prevalence of risk factors for 10 neglected tropical diseases in Texas or elsewhere in the United States. The data generated by future CASPERs conducted using this survey could be immediately actionable, guiding public health priority setting and decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: We characterized the pharmacogenomics (PGx) results received by diagnostic odyssey patients as secondary findings during clinical whole exome sequencing (WES) testing as a part of their care in Mayo Clinic's Individualized Medicine Clinic to determine the potential benefits and limitations to this cohort.; METHODS: WES results on 94 patients included a subset of PGx variants in CYP2C19,CYP2C9, and VKORC1 if identified in the patient. Demographic, phenotypic, and medication usage information was abstracted from patient medical data. A pharmacist interpreted the PGx results in the context of the patients' current medication use and made therapeutic recommendations.; RESULTS: The majority was young with a median age of 10years old, had neurological involvement in the disease presentation (71%), and was currently taking medications (90%). Of the 94 PGx-evaluated patients, 91% had at least one variant allele reported and 20% had potential immediate implications on current medication use.; CONCLUSION: Due to the disease complexity and medication needs of diagnostic odyssey patients, there may be immediate benefit obtained from early life PGx testing for many and most will likely find benefit in the future. These results require conscientious interpretation and management to be actionable for all prescribing physicians throughout the lifetime of the patient.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study compared risks associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with non-MRI conditional and MRI conditional pacing and defibrillator systems with particular attention to clinically actionable outcomes.; BACKGROUND: While recipients of new MRI conditional pacemaker and defibrillator systems may undergo MRI scanning with very low risk, safety and regulatory concerns persist regarding such scanning in recipients of non-MRI conditional systems.; METHODS: Patients with any cardiac device who were referred for MRI were prospectively enrolled at a single center and underwent scanning at 1.5 Tesla. Pre- and postscan lead characteristic changes, system integrity, and symptoms were analyzed. A comparison was made between non-MRI conditional and MRI conditional devices.; RESULTS: 105 patients were evaluated allowing for comparison of 97 scans with non-MRI conditional devices and 16 scans with MRI conditional devices. The cohort included those with pacemaker dependency, defibrillator, and cardiac resynchronization devices. Small, nonsignificant changes were observed in lead characteristics following scanning, and there was no significant difference when comparing non-MRI and MRI conditional devices. Lead parameter changes did not require lead revision or programming changes. No device reset, failures, or premature scan termination was observed.; CONCLUSIONS: 1.5 T MRI scanning in patients with MRI conditional and non-MRI conditional cardiac devices was performed with similar, low clinical risk. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this essay, I offer some reflections on how the topics were identified and approached by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, on which I had the honor to serve, in the hope that the reflections may be useful to future national bioethics commissions. In the executive order that established the bioethics commission, President Obama explicitly recognized the ethical imperative to responsibly pursue science, innovation, and advances in biomedical research and health care, and the importance of national attention to these issues. The bioethics commission prioritized practicable, actionable, targeted recommendations. Like most earlier U.S. national bioethics commissions, President Obama's commission did not undertake projects on significant and troublesome issues related to health and health care that were not associated with new science or technology. Issues such as health care access, health care delivery, opioid addiction, end-of-life care, and physician-aid-in-dying are topical and ethically complex areas of significance to bioethics, and they are also being discussed and debated by the public, the media, and policy-makers. In my view, there are good reasons to select and prioritize projects as well as a justification for confining commission efforts to issues related to novel science and emerging technologies, when there is only one national-level bioethics commission that has been established by the Office of the President. © 2017 The Hastings Center.

AB BACKGROUND: The global burden of periodontal diseases remains high. Population growth trends, changes in risk factors and improved tooth retention will increase the socio-economic burden of periodontitis that is responsible for 3.5million years lived with disability, 54billion USD/year in lost productivity and a major portion of the 442billion USD/year cost for oral diseases.; METHODS: In the context of the Milan World Exhibition 2015 "Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life," a green paper was developed and offered for global consultation by the European Federation of Periodontology. The final draft was endorsed by professional organizations around the world and is presented to stakeholders as a call for global action.; RESULTS: Specific actions for the public, policymakers, educators and professional organizations have been identified in the areas of prevention, detection and care. These actions align public interest and knowledge, need for self-care, professional intervention and policies to the best scientific evidence to proactively promote periodontal health and effectively manage the global burden of periodontal diseases, in accordance with WHO/UN priorities and strategies for tackling common non-communicable diseases via the Common Risk Factor Approach.; CONCLUSIONS: A strong and coherent body of evidence allows identification of actionable preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to effectively promote periodontal health and general wellbeing, and better manage the socio-economic consequences. Action requires consideration of the specific national scenarios. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Accurate risk prediction for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression can inform the patient-provider dialogue, and provide actionable thresholds for key clinical decisions. In 2011, we developed the kidney failure risk equations (KFREs) to predict the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant in patients with CKD. Subsequently, the KFREs have been extensively validated, and have now been proven accurate in multiple continents, ethnicities and disease-specific subpopulations. They can discriminate progressors from non-progressors, and are well calibrated and easy to use. We believe that current and future studies should now focus on clinical implementation of the KFREs, through quality improvement initiatives and cluster randomized trials. A risk-based care paradigm for CKD care can be achieved through knowledge translation and implementation research. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

AB Importance: Patients with breast cancer (BrCa) brain metastases (BrM) have limited therapeutic options. A better understanding of molecular alterations acquired in BrM could identify clinically actionable metastatic dependencies.; Objective: To determine whether there are intrinsic subtype differences between primary tumors and matched BrM and to uncover BrM-acquired alterations that are clinically actionable.; Design, Setting, and Participants: In total, 20 cases of primary breast cancer tissue and resected BrM (10 estrogen receptor [ER]-negative and 10 ER-positive) from 2 academic institutions were included. Eligible cases in the discovery cohort harbored patient-matched primary breast cancer tissue and resected BrM. Given the rarity of patient-matched samples, no exclusion criteria were enacted. Two validation sequencing cohorts were used-a published data set of 17 patient-matched cases of BrM and a cohort of 7884 BrCa tumors enriched for metastatic samples.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain metastases expression changes in 127 genes within BrCa signatures, PAM50 assignments, and ERBB2/HER2 DNA-level gains.; Results: Overall, 17 of 20 BrM retained the PAM50 subtype of the primary BrCa. Despite this concordance, 17 of 20 BrM harbored expression changes (<2-fold or >2-fold) in clinically actionable genes including gains of FGFR4 (n=6 [30%]), FLT1 (n=4 [20%]), AURKA (n=2 [10%]) and loss of ESR1 expression (n=9 [45%]). The most recurrent expression gain was ERBB2/HER2, which showed a greater than 2-fold expression increase in 7 of 20 BrM (35%). Three of these 7 cases were ERBB2/HER2-negative out of 13 ERBB2/HER2-negative in the primary BrCa cohort and became immunohistochemical positive (3+) in the paired BrM with metastasis-specific amplification of the ERBB2/HER2 locus. In an independent data set, 2 of 9 (22.2%) ERBB2/HER2-negative BrCa switched to ERBB2/HER2-positive with 1 BrM acquiring ERBB2/HER2 amplification and the other showing metastatic enrichment of the activating V777L ERBB2/HER2 mutation. An expanded cohort revealed that ERBB2/HER2 amplification and/or mutation frequency was unchanged between local disease and metastases across all sites; however, a significant enrichment was appreciated for BrM (13% local vs 24% BrM; P<.001).; Conclusions and Relevance: Breast cancer BrM commonly acquire alterations in clinically actionable genes, with metastasis-acquired ERBB2/HER2 alterations in approximately 20% of ERBB2/HER2-negative cases. These observations have immediate clinical implications for patients with ERBB2/HER2-negative breast cancer and support comprehensive profiling of metastases to inform clinical care.

AB Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a significant global health challenge and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The traditional 'one-size-fits-all' treatment approach has now evolved into one that involves personalized strategies based on histological and molecular subtypes. The molecular era has revolutionized the treatment of patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 gene aberrations. In the appropriately selected population, anti-tumor agents against these molecular targets can significantly improve progression-free survival. However, the emergence of acquired resistance is inevitable. Novel potent compounds with much improved and rational selectivity profiles, such as third-generation EGFR T790M resistance mutation-specific inhibitors, have been developed and added to the NSCLC armamentarium. To date, attempts to overcome resistance bypass pathways through downstream signaling blockade has had limited success. Furthermore, the majority of patients still do not harbor known driver genetic or epigenetic alterations and/or have no new available treatment options, with chemotherapy remaining their standard of care. Several potentially actionable driver aberrations have recently been identified, with the early clinical development of multiple inhibitors against these promising targets currently in progress. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to significant benefit for advanced NSCLC patients with durable responses observed. Further interrogation of the underlying biology of NSCLC, coupled with modern clinical trial designs, is now required to develop novel targeted therapeutics rationally matched with predictive biomarkers of response, so as to further advance NSCLC therapeutics through the next decade.

AB Research has suggested that products manufactured under healthy work conditions (HWC) may provide a marketing advantage to companies. This paper explores young consumers' considerations of HWC in purchasing decisions using data from qualitative interviews with a sample of 21 university students. The results suggest that interviewees frequently considered the working conditions of those who produced the products they purchased. Participants reported a willingness to pay 17.5% more on a $100 product if it were produced under HWC compared to not. Their ability and willingness to act on this issue was, however, hamperedby a lack of credible information about working conditions in production, the limited availability of HWC goods and a presumed higher price of HWC goods. While caution should be applied when generalising from this targetable market segment to a general population, these results provide actionable direction for companies interested in using a HWC brand image to gain a strategic sales advantage. Practitioner Summary: This interview study shows that young consumers are interested in, and willing to pay a premium for, goods made under healthy working conditions (HWC). Reported barriers to acting on this impulse include a lack of credible information on working conditions. Ergonomics can help provide a strategic marketing advantage for companies.

AB Climate change impact assessments are predominantly undertaken for the purpose of informing future adaptation decisions. Often, the complexity of the methodology hinders the actionable outcomes. The approach used here illustrates the importance of considering uncertainty in future climate projections, at the same time providing robust and simple to interpret information for decision-makers. By quantifying current and future exposure of Royal Gala apple to damaging temperature extremes across ten important pome fruit-growing locations in Australia, differences in impact to ripening fruit are highlighted, with, by the end of the twenty-first century, some locations maintaining no sunburn browning risk, while others potentially experiencing the risk for the majority of the January ripening period. Installation of over-tree netting can reduce the impact of sunburn browning. The benefits from employing this management option varied across the ten study locations. The two approaches explored to assist decision-makers assess this information (a) using sunburn browning risk analogues and (b) through identifying hypothetical sunburn browning risk thresholds, resulted in varying recommendations for introducing over-tree netting. These recommendations were location and future time period dependent with some sites showing no benefit for sunburn protection from nets even by the end of the twenty-first century and others already deriving benefits from employing this adaptation option. Potential best and worst cases of sunburn browning risk and its potential reduction through introduction of over-tree nets were explored. The range of results presented highlights the importance of addressing uncertainty in climate projections that result from different global climate models and possible future emission pathways.

AB Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who experience abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms often seek care in the emergency department (ED). These patients commonly undergo abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) as part of their evaluation, and the rate of imaging appears to be increasing without a corresponding increase in identification of clinically actionable findings or effect on disposition. Studies demonstrate that the yield of CT tends to be fairly high. Yet, because inflammatory bowel disease is often diagnosed at an early age, these patients are repeatedly imaged during their lifetime, a subset of whom accumulate high levels of ionizing radiation exposure, increasing their risk of cancer. This compounds an already increased risk of cancer in these patients because of inflammatory bowel disease alone. Lack of intimate knowledge of a patient's disease phenotype and disease progression contributes to uncertainty in distinguishing between an inflammatory exacerbation; a complication such as obstruction, abscess, perforation, fistula, or stricture; and anoninflammatory-bowel-disease-related condition. This uncertainty can lead to overuse of imaging with CT. Limited availability of and lack of awareness of alternate imaging modalities and strategies may prevent providers from pursuing strategies that avoid ionizing radiation. In this article, we review options for imaging inflammatory bowel disease patients in the ED and attempts undertaken to risk stratify these patients, and we discuss ways in which details of a patient's disease might guide imaging decisionmaking.

AB OBJECTIVES: - To develop evidence-based guideline recommendations through a systematic review of the literature to establish standard molecular biomarker testing of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues to guide epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies and conventional chemotherapy regimens.; METHODS: - The American Society for Clinical Pathology, College of American Pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based guideline to establish standard molecular biomarker testing and guide therapies for patients with CRC. A comprehensive literature search that included more than 4,000 articles was conducted.; RESULTS: - Twenty-one guideline statements were established.; CONCLUSIONS: - Evidence supports mutational testing for EGFR signaling pathway genes, since they provide clinically actionable information as negative predictors of benefit to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapies for targeted therapy of CRC. Mutations in several of the biomarkers have clear prognostic value. Laboratory approaches to operationalize CRC molecular testing are presented.

AB Purpose Molecular testing of colorectal cancers (CRCs) to improve patient care and outcomes of targeted and conventional therapies has been the center of many recent studies, including clinical trials. Evidence-based recommendations for the molecular testing of CRC tissues to guide epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -targeted therapies and conventional chemotherapy regimens are warranted in clinical practice. The purpose of this guideline is to develop evidence-based recommendations to help establish standard molecular biomarker testing for CRC through a systematic review of the literature. Methods The American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), College of American Pathologists (CAP), Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened an Expert Panel to develop an evidence-based guideline to help establish standard molecular biomarker testing, guide targeted therapies, and advance personalized care for patients with CRC. A comprehensive literature search that included over 4,000 articles was conducted to gather data to inform this guideline. Results Twenty-one guideline statements (eight recommendations, 10 expert consensus opinions and three no recommendations) were established. Recommendations Evidence supports mutational testing for genes in the EGFR signaling pathway, since they provide clinically actionable information as negative predictors of benefit to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapies for targeted therapy of CRC. Mutations in several of the biomarkers have clear prognostic value. Laboratory approaches to operationalize molecular testing for predictive and prognostic molecular biomarkers involve selection of assays, type of specimens to be tested, timing of ordering of tests and turnaround time for testing results.

AB Spatial heterogeneity of transcriptional and genetic markers between physically isolated biopsies of a single tumor poses major barriers to the identification of biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies that will be effective against the entire tumor. We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of multiregional biopsies from 35 patients, using a combination of transcriptomic and genomic profiles. Medulloblastomas (MBs), but not high-grade gliomas (HGGs), demonstrated spatially homogeneous transcriptomes, which allowed for accurate subgrouping of tumors from a single biopsy. Conversely, somatic mutations that affect genes suitable for targeted therapeutics demonstrated high levels of spatial heterogeneity in MB, malignant glioma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Actionable targets found in a single MB biopsy were seldom clonal across the entire tumor, which brings the efficacy of monotherapies against a single target into question. Clinical trials of targeted therapies for MB should first ensure the spatially ubiquitous nature of the target mutation.

AB The goals of the present targeted review on maternal and child overweight and obesity were to: (i) understand the current situation in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with regard to recent trends and context-specific risk factors; and (ii) building off this, identify entry points for leveraging existing undernutrition programmes to address overweight and obesity in LMIC. Trends reveal that overweight and obesity are a growing problem among women and children in LMIC; as in Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, where the prevalence among urban women is approaching 50 %. Four promising entry points were identified: (i) the integration of overweight and obesity into national nutrition plans; (ii) food systems (integration of food and beverage marketing regulations into existing polices on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes and adoption of policies to promote healthy diets); (iii) education systems (integration of nutrition into school curricula with provision of high-quality foods through school feeding programmes); and (iv) health systems (counselling and social and behaviour change communication to improve maternal diet, appropriate gestational weight gain, and optimal infant and young child feeding practices). We conclude by presenting a step-by-step guide for programme officers and policy makers in LMIC with actionable objectives to address overweight and obesity.

AB INTRODUCTION: Disorders of the lower urinary tract are frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis throughout the course of the disease and reach variable prevalences close to 75%. It is essential to obtain an early diagnosis in the initial phases and to implement an optimal therapeutic management. Burks et al developed the Actionable Bladder Symptoms Screening Tool (ABSST) as a useful screening test in such disorders. Later, Bates et al developed a short version of the ABSST with the objective of minimising the time required to complete it and making it easier to use.; AIMS: To carry out the transcultural validation into Spanish of the short version of the ABSST.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ABSST was translated into Spanish and then back-translated into English, which confirmed the semantic equivalence. A field test was conducted on 40 patients with multiple sclerosis, with two extra questions being included at the end in order to check the comprehension and acceptability of the tool, together with a final item that asked for the time spent on completing it.; RESULTS: Forty patients were selected In accordance with the eligibility and exclusion criteria; 67.5% of them were females and the overall mean age was 46.2 years. The rate of comprehension of the test was 100%, and that of acceptability was 97.5%. Results showed that 57.5% obtained scores >= 3, and an average of 5.33 minutes were spent on completing it.; CONCLUSIONS: As a brief screening questionnaire for urinary disorders in multiple sclerosis, the ABSST is a useful tool for detecting them at an early stage and has now been validated for use in Spanish.

AB Precision oncology, defined as molecular profiling of tumors to identify targetable alterations, is rapidly developing and has entered the mainstream of clinical practice. Genomic testing involves many stakeholders working in a coordinated fashion to deliver high-quality tissue samples to high-quality laboratories, where appropriate next-generation sequencing (NGS) molecular analysis leads to actionable results. Clinicians should be familiar with the types of genomic variants reported by the laboratory and the technology used to determine the results, including limitations of current testing methodologies and reports. Interpretation of genomic results is best undertaken with multidisciplinary input to reduce uncertainty in clinical recommendations relating to a documented variant. Non-small cell lung cancer has emerged as a prototype disease where genomic data from at least several well-documented alterations with approved targeted agents are essential for optimal treatment from diagnosis of advanced disease. Due to the development of resistance to targeted therapies, resampling and retesting of tumors, including using liquid biopsy technology after clinical progression, may be important in making treatment decisions. The value of molecular profiling depends on avoiding both underutilization for well-documented variant target-drug pairs and overutilization of variant-drug therapy without proven benefit. As techniques evolve and become more cost effective, the use of molecular testing may prove to add more specificity and improve outcomes for a larger number of patients.

AB This review focuses on three areas of interest with respect to the treatment of stage II and III colon and rectal cancer, including (1) tailoring adjuvant therapy for the geriatric population, (2) the controversy as to the optimal adjuvant therapy strategy for patients with locoregional rectal cancer and for patients with colorectal resectable metastatic disease, and (3) discussion of the microenvironment, molecular profiling, and the future of adjuvant therapy. It has become evident that age is the strongest predictive factor for receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, duration of treatment, and risk of treatment-related toxicity. Although incorporating adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery would appear to be a reasonable strategy to improve survivorship as an extrapolation from stage III colon cancer adjuvant trials, attempts at defining the optimal rectal cancer population that would benefit from adjuvant therapy remain elusive. Similarly, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients after resection of metastatic colorectal cancer has not been clearly defined because of very limited data to provide guidance. An understanding of the biologic hallmarks and drivers of metastatic spread as well as the micrometastatic environment is expected to translate into therapeutic strategies tailored to select patients. The identification of actionable targets in mesenchymal tumors is of major interest.

AB Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the high disease prevalence, gastric cancer research has not gained much attention. Recently, genome-scale technology has made it possible to explore the characteristics of gastric cancer at the molecular level. Accordingly, gastric cancer can be classified into molecular subtypes that convey more detailed information of tumor than histopathological characteristics, and these subtypes are associated with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, this molecular knowledge helps to identify new actionable targets and develop novel therapeutic strategies. To advance the concept of precision patient care in the clinic, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have recently been developed. PDX models not only represent histology and genomic features, but also predict responsiveness to investigational drugs in patient tumors. Molecularly curated PDX cohorts will be instrumental in hypothesis generation, biomarker discovery, and drug screening and testing in proof-of-concept preclinical trials for precision therapy. In the era of precision medicine, molecularly tailored therapeutic strategies should be individualized for cancer patients. To improve the overall clinical outcome, a multimodal approach is indispensable for advanced cancer patients. Careful, oncological principle-based surgery, combined with a molecularly guided multidisciplinary approach, will open new horizons in surgical oncology. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB PURPOSE: Ductal carcinomas (DCs) of the lacrimal gland are very rare but aggressive malignancies. We investigated DC of the lacrimal gland for potentially clinically actionable targets in the search for new therapeutic options.; METHODS: Case 1: A 77-year-old man, presented with diplopia and xerophtalmia; case 2: A 53-year-old man, presented with headache, proptosis and chemosis and case 3: A 73-year-old man, presenting with chemosis and a corneal abscess. All three cases were characterized morphologically including immunohistochemistry and genetically with fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) and one case with next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cancer relevant genes.; RESULTS: Cases 1 and 3 were composed of large, rounded, irregular cystic nodules of carcinoma cells with prominent central comedonecrosis, whereas case 2 had a scirrhous morphology. High expression of CK7, CK19, EMA, p53 and HER2 was characteristic for all three tumours. Androgen receptor was intensely positive in case 1, in scattered cells in case 2 and negative in case 3, whereas oestrogen and progesterone receptor were consistently negative. Genetically, a hemizygous deletion and a point mutation in PTEN were identified in case 1, whereas HER2 amplification was found in cases 2 and 3.; CONCLUSION: This study identified a spectrum of genetic events and pattern of protein expression in DC of the lacrimal gland similar to a subset of carcinomas of the breast and ductal carcinomas of the salivary glands. For therapeutic purposes, aberrations in several components of especially the HER2 signalling pathway could alleviate the effect of HER2-directed therapy illustrating an inadequacy of isolated HER2 testing. © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

AB microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. Their differential abundance is indicative or even causative for a variety of pathological processes including cancer or cardiovascular disorders. Due to their important biological function, miRNAs represent a promising class of novel biomarkers that may be used to diagnose life-threatening diseases, and to monitor disease progression. Further, they may guide treatment selection or dosage of drugs. miRNAs from blood or derived fractions are particularly interesting candidates for routine laboratory applications, as they can be measured in most clinical laboratories already today. This assures a good accessibility of respective tests. Albeit their great potential, miRNA-based diagnostic tests have not made their way yet into the clinical routine, and hence no standardized workflows have been established to measure miRNAs for patients' benefit. In this review we summarize the detection technologies and workflow options that exist to measure miRNAs, and we describe the advantages and disadvantages of each of these options. Moreover, we also provide a perspective on data analysis aspects that are vital for translation of raw data into actionable diagnostic test results.

AB BACKGROUND: The ability to analyze the genomics of malignancies has opened up new possibilities for off-label targeted therapy in cancers that are refractory to standard therapy. At Mayo Clinic these efforts are organized through the Center for Individualized Medicine (CIM).; RESULTS: Prior to GTB, datasets were analyzed and integrated by a team of bioinformaticians and cancer biologists. Therapeutically actionable mutations were identified in 65% (92/141) of the patients tested with 32% (29/92) receiving genomically targeted therapy with FDA approved drugs or in an independent clinical trial with 45% (13/29) responding. Standard of care (SOC) options were continued by 15% (14/92) of patients tested before exhausting SOC options, with 71% (10/14) responding to treatment. Over 35% (34/92) of patients with actionable targets were not treated with 65% (22/34) choosing comfort measures or passing away.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 165) were referred to the CIM Clinic between October 2012 and December 2015. All patients received clinical genomic panel testing with selected subsets receiving array comparative genomic hybridization and clinical whole exome sequencing to complement and validate panel findings. A genomic tumor board (GTB) reviewed results and, when possible, developed treatment recommendations.; CONCLUSIONS: Treatment decisions driven by tumor genomic analysis can lead to significant clinical benefit in a minority of patients. The success of genomically driven therapy depends both on access to drugs and robustness of bioinformatics analysis. While novel clinical trial designs are increasing the utility of genomic testing, robust data sharing of outcomes is needed to optimize clinical benefit for all patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Modeling of microbial metabolism is a topic of growing importance in biotechnology. Mathematical modeling helps provide a mechanistic understanding for the studied process, separating the main drivers from the circumstantial ones, bounding the outcomes of experiments and guiding engineering approaches. Among different modeling schemes, the quantification of intracellular metabolic fluxes (i.e. the rate of each reaction in cellular metabolism) is of particular interest for metabolic engineering because it describes how carbon and energy flow throughout the cell. In addition to flux analysis, new methods for the effective use of the ever more readily available and abundant -omics data (i.e. transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) are urgently needed.; RESULTS: The jQMM library presented here provides an open-source, Python-based framework for modeling internal metabolic fluxes and leveraging other -omics data for the scientific study of cellular metabolism and bioengineering purposes. Firstly, it presents a complete toolbox for simultaneously performing two different types of flux analysis that are typically disjoint: Flux Balance Analysis and 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis. Moreover, it introduces the capability to use 13C labeling experimental data to constrain comprehensive genome-scale models through a technique called two-scale 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (2S-13C MFA). In addition, the library includes a demonstration of a method that uses proteomics data to produce actionable insights to increase biofuel production. Finally, the use of the jQMM library is illustrated through the addition of several Jupyter notebook demonstration files that enhance reproducibility and provide the capability to be adapted to the user's specific needs.; CONCLUSIONS: jQMM will facilitate the design and metabolic engineering of organisms for biofuels and other chemicals, as well as investigations of cellular metabolism and leveraging -omics data. As an open source software project, we hope it will attract additions from the community and grow with the rapidly changing field of metabolic engineering.

AB Targeted genomic profiling (TGP) using massively parallel DNA sequencing is becoming the standard methodology in clinical laboratories for detecting somatic variants in solid tumors. The variety of methodologies and sequencing platforms in the marketplace for TGP has resulted in a variety of clinical TGP laboratory developed tests (LDT). The variability of LDTs is a challenge for test-to-test and laboratory-to-laboratory reliability. At the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC), we validated a TGP assay for solid tumors which utilizes DNA hybridization capture and complete exon and selected intron sequencing of 29 clinically actionable genes. The validation samples were run on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Clinical specificity and sensitivity were evaluated by testing samples harboring genomic variants previously identified in CLIA-approved, CAP accredited laboratories with clinically validated molecular assays. The Molecular Laboratory at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) provided 11 FFPE specimens that had been analyzed on AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel version 2 (CHPv2) and run on the Ion Torrent PGM. A Venn diagram of the gene lists from the two institutions is shown. This provided an excellent opportunity to compare the inter-laboratory reliability using two different target sequencing methods and sequencing platforms. Our data demonstrated an exceptionally high level of concordance with respect to the sensitivity and specificity of the analyses. All clinically-actionable SNV and InDel variant calls in genes covered by both panels (n=17) were identified by both laboratories. This data supports the proposal that distinct gene panel designs and sequencing workflows are capable of making consistent variant calls in solid tumor FFPE-derived samples.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical genome and exome sequencing (CGES) is being used in an expanding range of clinical settings. Most approaches to offering patients choices about learning CGES results classify results according to expert definitions of clinical actionability. Little is known about how patients conceptualize different categories of CGES results.; METHODS: The MedSeq Project is a randomized controlled trial studying the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in primary care and cardiology. We surveyed 202 patient-participants about different kinds of WGS results and conducted qualitative interviews with 49 of these participants. Interview data were analyzed both inductively and deductively using thematic content analysis.; RESULTS: Participants demonstrated high levels of study understanding and genetic literacy. A small majority of participants wanted to learn all of their WGS results (n = 123, 61%). Qualitative data provided a deeper understanding of participants' perspectives about different types of WGS results. Participants did not have the same views about which WGS results would be actionable or upsetting to learn. They conceptualized variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in a variety of different ways. Many participants expressed optimism that the uncertainty associated with VUS results could be reduced over time.; CONCLUSIONS: Proposals to determine which WGS/CGES results to disclose by soliciting patient preferences may fail to appreciate the complex ways patients think about disease and the information WGS/CGES can produce. Our findings challenge prevailing methods of facilitating patient choice and assessing the benefits and harms related to the return of WGS/CGES results, which mostly rely on expert definitions of clinical utility to categorize the kinds of results patients can learn.

AB Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a heterogeneous group of cancers, which is composed of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECCA), gallbladder cancers and ampullary carcinomas. While all anatomic subgroups are treated uniformly, our understanding about the pathogenesis has allowed us to reason that each group represents a clinically and genetically diverse disease. The majority of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, where the standard treatment is combination systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. While most receive a clinical benefit from chemotherapy, patients eventually progress where no standardized therapies are available in the refractory setting. With the use of next generation sequencing, we have come to understand that ICCA is a diverse genomic disease with many actionable alterations that may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Further studies investigating the role of novel targeted agents (as a single agent or with combination chemotherapy) will hopefully provide additional treatment options for this highly lethal disease.

Patients with HCC vary markedly owing to heterogeneous tumor characteristics and concomitant liver dysfunction. In the United States and Europe, HCC is staged and managed according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. For very early and early stage HCC, or BCLC 0/A, liver transplant is the optimal treatment option. Liver resection and radiofrequency or microwave ablation are alternative treatment options. For intermediate stage HCC, or BCLC B, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard of care. An alternative locoregional therapy, transarterial radioembolization using yttrium-90, has shown comparable outcomes with TACE and may be used in patients for whom TACE is contraindicated. For advanced stage HCC, or BCLC C, systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the only evidence-based treatment option available. Another multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib, was recently approved as a second-line therapy for this patient group. Randomized clinical trials investigating other agents in enriched patient groups and novel therapeutics including checkpoint inhibitors are underway. Patient with prohibitive performance status and/or end stage liver dysfunction are classified terminal stage HCC, or BCLC D, and are managed with best supportive care. The future direction for the management of HCC will rely on continuing efforts to uncover molecular pathways and actionable genetic aberrations in HCC.

AB Biliary cancers (BCs) are a diverse group of tumors that arise from the bile duct epithelium and are divided into cholangiocarcinomas of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) and cancer of the gallbladder. Despite improvements in treatment and diagnosis, BCs are often diagnosed at an advanced stage and associated with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Recent discoveries have allowed us to have a better understanding of the genomic diversity in BC, and identify genes that are likely contributing to its pathogenesis, proliferation and treatment resistance. Additionally, these advances have allowed us to reason that each anatomic group within BC behave as distinct diseases, with differences in prognosis and outcomes. Based on this knowledge, recent advances have allowed us to identify actionable mutations that form rational therapeutic targets with novel agents, where their relevance will be better understood through the completion of prospective clinical trials.

AB Biliary tract cancers (BTC)/Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive biliary tract epithelial malignancy from varying locations within the biliary tree with cholangiocyte depreciation., including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) (iCCA), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). The disease is largely heterogeneous in etiology, epidemiology, and molecular profile. There are limited treatment options and low survival rates for those patients with advanced or metastatic disease. Systemic treatment is confined to cytotoxic chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Lack of a stereotype genetic signature makes difficult in identification of potential actionable target directly, which may also explain lack of obvious clinic benefit with target oriented agents from current studies. It is crucial to understand of BTC carcinogenesis, tumor-stroma interactions, and key molecular pathways, and herald to establish targeted, individualized therapies for the heterogeneous disease, and eventually to improve the survival and overall outcome of patients.

AB Since the prognosis of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains poor with traditional chemotherapy, attention has shifted to molecularly targeted agents. Results of available clinical studies reveal little or no benefit of using targeted agents in advanced CCA. Limitations of these trials could be the lack of comprehensive molecular and genetic characterization of CCA samples in order to identify potential drug targets. Here we report a case of a 59-year-old female with chemotherapy-refractor, metastatic extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCCA). After failure of first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin plus gemcitabine, next generation sequencing (NGS) based tumor molecular profiling was performed on aspiration cytological sample, that revealed BRAF V600E mutation. Multidisciplinary team decided on the initiation of combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Dabrafenib was started orally 150 mg twice a day, adding trametinib 2 mg once a day. Right from the initiation of targeted therapy, significant clinical improvement had been observed. Even though the first restaging computed tomography (CT) scan at 8 weeks revealed spectacular decrease in all metastatic sites, a new hepatic mass of 67 mm * 40 mm was identified and interpreted as new metastatic lesion. As the clinical and radiological response was contradictory, CT-guided biopsy was taken from the hepatic lesion while the therapy was continued on. Histopathologic evaluation excluded the hepatic lesion from being a metastasis, instead described it as a fibrotic, inflammatory lesion. At 12 week, PET CT confirmed further tumor regression with complete regression of the multiple cerebral metastases. The therapy has been extremely well tolerated by the patient. According to our knowledge, this is the first reported case on a successful treatment of EHCCA with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. Our case highlights the importance of molecular profiling in CCA, in order to find potential actionable driver mutations for personalised treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Physician burnout is common and associated with significant consequences for physicians and patients. One mechanism to combat burnout is to enhance meaning in work.; OBJECTIVE: To provide a trainee perspective on how meaning in work can be enhanced in the clinical learning environment through individual, program, and institutional efforts.; METHODS: "Back to Bedside" resulted from an appreciative inquiry exercise by 37 resident and fellow members of the ACGME's Council of Review Committee Residents (CRCR), which was guided by the memoir When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. The exercise was designed to (1) discover current best practices in existing learning environments; (2) dream of ideal ways to enhance meaning in work; (3) design solutions that move toward this optimal environment; and (4) support trainees in operationalizing innovative solutions.; RESULTS: Back to Bedside consists of 5 themes for how the learning environment can enhance meaning in daily work: (1) more time at the bedside, engaged in direct patient care, dialogue with patients and families, and bedside clinical teaching; (2) a shared sense of teamwork and respect among multidisciplinary health professionals and trainees; (3) decreasing the time spent on nonclinical and administrative responsibilities; (4) a supportive, collegial work environment; and (5) a learning environment conducive to developing clinical mastery and progressive autonomy. Participants identified actions to achieve these goals.; CONCLUSIONS: A national, multispecialty group of trainees developed actionable recommendations for how clinical learning environments can be improved to combat physician burnout by fostering meaning in work. These improvements can be championed by trainees.

AB AIM: The Actionable Bladder Symptom and Screening Tool (ABSST) is used to identify multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in possible need of evaluation for urinary symptoms. The primary objective of this study was to identify barriers experienced by MS patients in seeking evaluation for urinary symptoms. We also assessed the utility of ABSST tool in identifying patients that will follow up with urologic evaluation.; METHODS: This was a prospective observational study where 100 patients with MS were enrolled from an MS center. Patients completed demographic information, questions to assess barriers to care, a short form of the ABSST, and incontinence questionnaires. An ABSST score >3 met criteria for referral and evaluation. One year after enrollment, follow up calls assessed whether patients had seen a urinary specialist.; RESULTS: The most common barriers to seeking care included "Doctor never referred" (16%) and "Doctor never asked" (13%). Thirty-eight percent (n=8/21) of men stated "Doctor never referred" compared to 10% (n=8/79) of women (P=0.002). Twenty-seven patients had an ABSST Score ≥3 and were more interested in seeing a specialist compared to those scoring <3 (88.9%, n=24/27 vs. 26%, n=19/73; P=<0.001). After 1year, 70 patients were reached for follow up. A total of 57.9% (n=11/19) patients who followed up for evaluation screened positive on the ABSST.; CONCLUSIONS: The ABSST is a valuable tool to identify MS patients with urinary symptoms who will likely follow up for genitourinary evaluation. However, other barriers beyond awareness exist and prevent patients from being evaluated. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The rapid adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical molecular laboratories has redefined the practice of cytopathology. Instead of simply being used as a diagnostic tool, cytopathology has evolved into a practice providing important genomic information that guides clinical management. The recent emphasis on maximizing limited-volume cytology samples for ancillary molecular studies, including NGS, requires cytopathologists not only to be more involved in specimen collection and processing techniques but also to be aware of downstream testing and informatics issues. For the integration of molecular informatics into the clinical workflow, it is important to understand the computational components of the NGS workflow by which raw sequence data are transformed into clinically actionable genomic information and to address the challenges of having a robust and sustainable informatics infrastructure for NGS-based testing in a clinical environment. Adapting to needs ranging from specimen procurement to report delivery is crucial for the optimal utilization of cytology specimens to accommodate requests from clinicians to improve patient care. This review presents a broad overview of the various aspects of informatics in the context of NGS-based testing of cytology specimens.

AB Objective: To describe current practices and stakeholder perspectives of patient portals in the acute care setting. We aimed to: (1) identify key features, (2) recognize challenges, (3) understand current practices for design, configuration, and use, and (4) propose new directions for investigation and innovation.; Materials and Methods: Mixed methods including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and site visits with stakeholders at leading academic medical centers. Thematic analyses to inform development of an explanatory model and recommendations.; Results: Site surveys were administered to 5 institutions. Thirty interviews/focus groups were conducted at 4 site visits that included a total of 84 participants. Ten themes regarding content and functionality, engagement and culture, and access and security were identified, from which an explanatory model of current practices was developed. Key features included clinical data, messaging, glossary, patient education, patient personalization and family engagement tools, and tiered displays. Four actionable recommendations were identified by group consensus.; Discussion: Design, development, and implementation of acute care patient portals should consider: (1) providing a single integrated experience across care settings, (2) humanizing the patient-clinician relationship via personalization tools, (3) providing equitable access, and (4) creating a clear organizational mission and strategy to achieve outcomes of interest.; Conclusion: Portals should provide a single integrated experience across the inpatient and ambulatory settings. Core functionality includes tools that facilitate communication, personalize the patient, and deliver education to advance safe, coordinated, and dignified patient-centered care. Our findings can be used to inform a "road map" for future work related to acute care patient portals. © The Author 2016.

AB PURPOSE: The radiology report is a critical component of the Imaging Value Chain. Unfortunately, the quality of this aspect of a radiologist's work is often heterogeneous and fails to add significant value to the referring provider and, ultimately, the patient. Gauging what defines quality can be elusive; however, we elucidate techniques that can be employed to ensure that reports are more comprehensible, actionable, and useful to our customers.; METHODS: Four hundred consecutive studies (July-August 2015) submitted to our institution with request for a formal over-read were reviewed retrospectively, specifically focused on analyzing differences in language, organization, and impression between the outside reports and the formal over-reads performed at our institution. The formal over-reads were classified into one of the following categories: (1) no clinically significant change; (2) emergent clinically significant change; (3) nonemergent clinically significant change. Clinically significant changes were further classified as either perceptual or cognitive errors.; RESULTS: A total of 12.4% of formally over-read reports had clinically significant changes. Of these, 22.2% were emergent changes. Clinically significant changes were composed of 64.4% perceptual error and 35.6% cognitive error. Four strategies were discovered specifically related to reporting techniques that helped mitigate these errors on formal over-reads: (1) synthesizing varied anatomic findings into a cohesive disease process; (2) integration of relevant electronic health record data; (3) use of structured reporting; and (4) forming actionable impressions.; CONCLUSIONS: We identify, through examples, four strategies for reporting that add value through reduction of radiologic error, helping to mitigate the 12.4% clinically significant error rate found in reinterpretation of outside studies.

AB The concept of value in radiology has been strongly advocated in recent years as a means of advancing patient care and decreasing waste. This article explores the concept of value creation in radiology and offers a framework for how radiology practices can create value according to the needs of their referring clinicians. Value only exists in the eyes of a customer. We propose that the primary purpose of diagnostic radiology is to answer clinical questions using medical imaging to help guide management of patient care. Because they are the direct recipient of this service, we propose that referring clinicians are the direct customers of a radiology practice and patients are indirect customers. Radiology practices create value as they understand and fulfill their referring clinicians' needs. To narrow those needs to actionable categories, we propose a framework consisting of four major dimensions: (1) how quickly the clinical question needs to be answered, (2) the degree of specialization required to answer the question, (3) how often the referring clinician uses imaging, and (4) the breadth of imaging that the referring clinician uses. We further identify three major settings in which referring clinicians utilize radiological services: (1) emergent or urgent care, (2) primary care, and (3) specialty care. Practices best meet these needs as they engage with their referring clinicians, create a shared vision, work together as a cohesive team, structure the organization to meet referring clinicians' needs, build the tools, and continually improve in ways that help referring clinicians care for patients.

AB The long and short noncoding RNAs have been involved in the molecular diagnosis, targeted therapy, and predicting prognosis of lung cancer. Utilizing noncoding RNAs as biomarkers and systemic RNA interference as an innovative therapeutic strategy has an immense likelihood to generate novel concepts in precision oncology. Targeting of RNA interference payloads such as small interfering RNAs, microRNA mimetic, or anti-microRNA (antagomirs) into specific cell types has achieved initial success. The clinical trials of noncoding RNA-based therapies are on the way with some positive results. Many attempts are done for developing novel noncoding RNA delivery strategies that could overcome systemic or local barriers. Furthermore, it precipitates concerted efforts to define the molecular subtypes of lung cancer, characterize the genomic landscape of lung cancer subtypes, identify novel therapeutic targets, and reveal mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to targeted therapies. These efforts contribute a visible effect now in lung cancer precision medicine: patients receive molecular testing to determine whether their tumor harbors an actionable come resistance to the first-generation drugs are in clinical trials, and drugs targeting the immune system are showing activity in patients. This extraordinary promise is tempered by the sobering fact that even the newest treatments for metastatic disease are rarely curative and are effective only in a small fraction of all patients. Thus, ongoing and future efforts to find new vulnerabilities of lung cancers unravel the complexity of drug resistance, increase the efficacy of immunotherapies, and perform biomarker-driven clinical trials are necessary to improve the outcome of lung cancer patients.

AB Background: Since 2003, Afghanistan's largely unregulated for-profit private health sector has grown at a rapid pace. In 2008, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) launched a long-term stewardship initiative to oversee and regulate private providers and align the sector with national health goals.; Aim: We examine the progress the MoPH has made towards more effective stewardship, consider the challenges and assess the early impacts on for-profit performance.; Methods: We reviewed publicly available documents, publications and the grey literature to analyse the development, adoption and implementation of strategies, policies and regulations. We carried out a series of key informant/participant interviews, organizational capacity assessments and analyses of hospital standards checklists. Using a literature review of health systems strengthening, we proposed an Afghan-specific definition of six key stewardship functions to assess progress towards MoPH stewardship objectives.; Results: The MoPH and its partners have achieved positive results in strengthening its private sector stewardship functions especially in generating actionable intelligence and establishing strategic policy directions, administrative structures and a legal and regulatory framework. Progress has also been made on improving accountability and transparency, building partnerships and applying minimum required standards to private hospitals. Procedural and operational issues still need resolution and the MoPH is establishing mechanisms for resolving them.; Conclusions: The MoPH stewardship initiative is notable for its achievements to date under challenging circumstances. Its success is due to the focus on developing a solid policy framework and building institutions and systems aimed at ensuring higher quality private services, and a rational long-term and sustainable role for the private sector. Although the MoPH stewardship initiative is still at an early stage, the evidence suggests that enhanced stewardship functions in the MoPH are leading to a more efficient and effective for-profit private sector. These successful early efforts offer high-leverage potential to rapidly scale up going forward. © VC The Author 2016.

AB Youth with severe emotional and behavioral problems receiving services in public behavioral health systems have strengths that are understudied in research and underutilized in practice. This study explores four alternative strategies (individual item scores, the number of "actionable" strengths, subscales, and a total composite) for summarizing the strengths of youth assessed with the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) in a large, urban, public behavioral health system. The paper examines whether these summarization strategies produce divergent understandings of the prevalence of strengths across gender, age, and racial groups. Analyses suggest that youth enter this system with high levels of strengths. There are few group differences in strengths across the diverse summarization strategies. Though the practice-preferred method of using individual strengths items provides the most interpretable information about strengths, the aggregation strategies may be useful for programs and systems. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

AB Genomic risk information for potentially actionable complex diseases and pharmacogenomics communicated through genomic counseling (GC) may motivate physicians and patients to take preventive actions. The Ohio State University-Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative is a randomized trial to measure the effects of in-person GC on chronic disease patients provided with multiplex results. Nine personalized genomic risk reports were provided to patients through a web portal, and to physicians via electronic medical record (EMR). Active arm participants (98, 39% female) received GC within 1 month of report viewing; control arm subjects (101, 54% female) could access counseling 3-months post-report viewing. We examined whether GC affected documentation of physician-patient communication by reviewing the first clinical note following the patient's GC visit or report upload to the EMR. Multivariable logistic regression modeling estimated the independent effect of GC on physician-patient communication, as intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP), adjusted for physician educational intervention. Counselees in the active arm had more physician-patient communications than control subjects [ITT, odds ratio (OR): 3.76 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-10.22, p < 0.0094); PP, OR: 5.53 (95% CI: 2.20-13.90, p = 0.0017). In conclusion, GC appreciably affected physician-patient communication following receipt of potentially actionable genomic risk information. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB Targeting genomic alterations has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with lung cancer. In an effort to better identify potentially actionable alterations that may predict response to FDA-approved and or investigational therapies, many centers have migrated towards performing targeted exome sequencing in patients with stage IV disease. The implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the evaluation of tumor tissue from patients with NSCLC has led to the discovery of targetable alterations in tumors that previously had no known actionable targets by less comprehensive profiling. An improved understanding of the molecular pathways that drive oncogenesis in NSCLC and a revolution in the technological advances in NGS have led to the development of new therapies through biomarker-driven clinical trials. This review will focus on the advances in molecular profiling that continue to fuel the revolution of precision medicine, identifying targets such as MET exon 14 skipping alterations and select recurrent gene alterations with increasing frequency.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the use of molecular diagnostics in glioma and its effect on the development of novel therapeutics and management decisions.; RECENT FINDINGS: Genomic and proteomic profiling of brain tumors has provided significant expansion of our understanding of oncogenesis, characterization, and prognostication of brain tumors. Molecular markers such as MGMT, EGFR, IDH, 1p19q, ATRX, TERT, FGFR-TACC, and BRAF are now being used to classify brain tumors as well as influence management decisions. Several of these markers are also being used as therapeutic targets. We review the use of several molecular diagnostics in gliomas and discuss their impact on drug development and clinical trial design. In the future, molecular characterization based on a specific genomic, proteomic as well as transcriptomes for bioformatics analysis will provide clinicians the ability to rationally select drugs with actionable targets for each patient.

AB INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition in clinical practice. There are currently no objective tests to rule in the disease, but rather tests to rule out other diseases. Biomarkers in IBS may provide the tools needed for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. These include identification of differences in microbial composition, immune activation, bile acid composition, colonic transit, and alteration in sensation in subgroups of IBS patients. Areas covered: Studies included in our review were chosen based on a PubMed search for 'biomarkers' and 'IBS'. We have reviewed the literature on biomarkers to appraise their accuracy, validity and whether they are actionable. We have not covered genetic associations as biomarkers in this review. Expert commentary: There is significant promise in the usefulness of biomarkers for IBS. The most promising actionable biomarkers are markers of changes in bile acid balance, such as elevated bile acid in the stool, and altered colonic transit. However, there is also potential for microbial studies and mucosal proteases as future actionable biomarkers.

AB Improving diagnosis and treatment depends on clinical monitoring and computing. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been in existence for over 50years. While the literature points to positive impacts on quality and patient safety, outcomes, and the avoidance of medical errors, technical and regulatory challenges continue to retard their rate of integration into clinical care processes and thus delay the refinement of diagnoses towards personalized care. We conducted a systematic review of pertinent articles in the MEDLINE, US Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Health Research and Quality, and US Food and Drug Administration databases, using a Boolean approach to combine terms germane to the discussion (clinical decision support, tools, systems, critical care, trauma, outcome, cost savings, NSQIP, APACHE, SOFA, ICU, and diagnostics). References were selected on the basis of both temporal and thematic relevance, and subsequently aggregated around four distinct themes: the uses of CDSS in the critical and surgical care settings, clinical insertion challenges, utilization leading to cost-savings, and regulatory concerns. Precision diagnosis is the accurate and timely explanation of each patient's health problem and further requires communication of that explanation to patients and surrogate decision-makers. Both accuracy and timeliness are essential to critical care, yet computed decision support systems (CDSS) are scarce. The limitation arises from the technical complexity associated with integrating and filtering large data sets from diverse sources. Provider mistrust and resistance coupled with the absence of clear guidance from regulatory bodies further retard acceptance of CDSS. While challenges to develop and deploy CDSS are substantial, the clinical, quality, and economic impacts warrant the effort, especially in disciplines requiring complex decision-making, such as critical and surgical care. Improving diagnosis in health care requires accumulation, validation and transformation of data into actionable information. The aggregate of those processes-CDSS-is currently primitive. Despite technical and regulatory challenges, the apparent clinical and economic utilities of CDSS must lead to greater engagement. These tools play the key role in realizing the vision of a more 'personalized medicine', one characterized by individualized precision diagnosis rather than population-based risk-stratification.

AB Lower limb vascular amputations represent serious problem in the vascular care. As a consequence of critical limb ischemia, often associated with diabetes, it is highly critical to health care service aiming at prevention of limb loss. Understanding of the nature and complexity of amputation scenario is paramount for the effective preventive strategy planning and implementation. Amputation incidence and data of the trends show high variability in the international reports. Variability is also remarkable in a more granular, regional comparison. Different calculation methods for incidence fraction, varying epidemiological, demographic features of the populations, different socio-economic, cultural backgrounds and disparity in vascular care are the main factors contributing to this variability in reports. Lower limb amputations can be considered as a valuable healthcare quality indicator with some limitations. One of these limitations is the lower actionability that corresponds to the reduced ability of health care providers to intervene influencing the burden of amputations. Lower limb vascular amputations represent a lifetime risk, therefore not only the effective revascularization is to be achieved but the importance of the early recognition of peripheral arterial disease, no delay in referral to special vascular care, effective vascular risk prevention and collaboration in multidisciplinary teams should be also emphasized.

AB Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is an orphan malignancy with poorly understood biology and suboptimal systemic therapy. Given that kinases may be drivers and readily actionable, we performed comprehensive multiplatform analysis of kinases in PSCC tumor and normal tissue. Fresh frozen tumors were collected from 11 patients with PSCC. After macrodissection to demarcate tumor from normal tissue, the samples underwent multiplatform analysis of kinases. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of 517 kinase genes was performed using Agilent Kinome capture and run on the Illumina MiSeq at PE150bp. The NanoString nCounter platform analyzed the expression of 519 kinase genes. Kinase activity of tissue lysates was measured using PamStation12 high-content phospho-peptide substrate microarray system. Network mapping was done with GeneGo MetaCore and upstream kinase prediction was performed with BioNavigator and the Kinexus database. Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to integrate elevated kinase activity and gene over-expression with coexisting missense mutations at DNA level. Top pathways upregulated in both the kinase activity and gene expression platforms were PTEN, STAT3, GNRH, IL-8 and B cell receptor signaling. Potentially relevant missense mutations were seen in 176 kinase genes, with the top altered pathways overlapping with gene overexpression being GNRH, NF-kB and STAT3 signaling. ERBB2, ERBB3 and SYK were altered on NGS and also exhibited elevated kinase activity. To summarize, multiplatform comprehensive analysis of kinases discovered potential drivers of PSCC and actionable therapeutic targets. Translational studies are necessary to validate the functional relevance of our data to make advances in this rare malignancy.

AB Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is an indolent translocation-associated soft tissue sarcoma with a high propensity for metastases. Using a clinical sequencing approach, we genomically profiled patients with metastatic EMC to elucidate the molecular biology and identify potentially actionable mutations. We also evaluated potential predictive factors of benefit to sunitinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with reported activity in a subset of EMC patients. Between January 31, 2012 and April 15, 2016, six patients with EMC participated in the clinical sequencing research study. High quality DNA and RNA was isolated and matched normal samples underwent comprehensive next generation sequencing (whole or OncoSeq capture exome of tumor and normal, tumor PolyA+ and capture transcriptome). The expression levels of sunitinib targeted-kinases were measured by transcriptome sequencing for KDR, PDGFRA/B, KIT, RET, FLT1, and FLT4. The previously reported EWSR1-NR4A3 translocation was identified in all patient tumors; however, other recurring genomic abnormalities were not detected. RET expression was significantly greater in patients with EMC relative to other types of sarcomas except for liposarcoma (p<0.0002). The folate receptor was overexpressed in two patients. Our study demonstrated that similar to other translocation-associated sarcomas, the mutational profile of metastatic EMC is limited beyond the pathognomonic translocation. The clinical significance of RET expression in EMC should be explored. Additional pre-clinical investigations of EMC may help elucidate molecular mechanisms contributing to EMC tumorigenesis that could be translated to the clinical setting.

AB BACKGROUND: Cancer of unknown primary site is still a demanding condition as it is per definition metastatic, with heterogeneous biological behavior, and it is often resistant to therapy. Cancer of unknown primary site accounts for approximately 1 to 5 % of all cancers, but is currently among the top six causes of cancer deaths in Western countries. To correctly identify the biological origin of the tumor, a large spectrum of differential diagnoses must be considered and scrutinized. At progression, re-biopsy might be necessary to reveal the true origin of the tumor or actionable targets.; CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Norwegian woman, with a fast growing lump in her left groin, was primarily diagnosed as having undifferentiated carcinoma that was BRAF V600 positive. There was complete response with paclitaxel-carboplatin and she was recurrence-free for 18 months. She had recurrence in both lungs and subcutaneously in her left groin and thigh; a re-biopsy revealed transformation to a malignant melanoma. She was resistant to BRAF inhibitors, then treated with ipilimumab and is currently a long-term survivor of 4 years and 4 months since the first diagnosis, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence.; CONCLUSIONS: A biopsy from patients with metastasis of unknown primary should be analyzed thoroughly to identify organ of origin, molecular make-up, and possible molecular targets. Re-biopsy of cancer of unknown primary site at progression can reveal the true cellular origin of the tumor as well as provide novel therapeutic opportunities, including immunotherapy.

AB Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of related clonal hematologic disorders characterized by excess accumulation of one or more myeloid cell lineages and a tendency to transform to acute myeloid leukemia. Deregulated JAK2 signaling has emerged as the central phenotypic driver of BCR -ABL1-negative MPNs and a unifying therapeutic target. In addition, MPNs show unexpected layers of genetic complexity, with multiple abnormalities associated with disease progression, interactions between inherited factors and phenotype driver mutations, and effects related to the order in which mutations are acquired. Although morphology and clinical laboratory analysis continue to play an important role in defining these conditions, genomic analysis is providing a platform for better disease definition, more accurate diagnosis, direction of therapy, and refined prognostication. There is an emerging consensus with regard to many prognostic factors, but there is a clear need to synthesize genomic findings into robust, clinically actionable and widely accepted scoring systems as well as the need to standardize the laboratory methodologies that are used.

AB Studies on the material throughput in the socioeconomic system from the viewpoint of metabolism is not only important for understanding the relationship between human activities and natural environment, but also helpful for utilizing resources in a reasonable and sustainable manner. Based on the review of the research progress in material metabolism worldwide, which included the methodology, application on different scales, and effects on resource and environment, the state of the art of existing literature and the challenges remained for future studies were summarized systema-tically. The material metabolism research should shift its focus on the single theory and method to the integration of multi-theories and methods so as to address the complex metabolism problems. With the increasingly important role that cities play in global ecological environment, more emphasis should be laid on the combination of traditional metabolism research with spatial analysis, and the incorporation of indicators like human wellbeing into the research scope in city-scale research. By doing so, more actionable and sustainable policies could be designed to conserve resources, mitigate the environmental load, and enhance the coordination among the development in economy, environment and society.

AB Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is one of the most pressing challenges in the field of infectious diseases and is one of 4 key areas of unmet medical need identified by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG). The mission of the Gram-Negative Committee is to advance our knowledge of these challenging infections and implement studies to improve patient outcomes. Studies have fallen primarily into 2 broad categories: prospective cohort studies and interventional trials. Among the observational studies, CRACKLE (Consortium on Resistance Against Carbapenems in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Other Enterobacteriaceae) has contributed seminal multicenter data describing risk factors and clinical outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in sentinel US hospitals. Building on this success, CRACKLE II will expand the network to hospitals across the United States and Colombia. Similar protocols have been proposed to include Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (SNAP and POP studies). In addition, the CREST study (Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Solid Organ Transplant Patients) has provided pivotal data on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE carriage among solid organ transplant recipients to inform management of this vulnerable patient population. Two clinical trials to define novel ways of using an existing antibiotic, fosfomycin, to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (one that has completed enrollment and the other in late protocol development) will determine the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin as step-down oral therapy to treat complicated urinary tract infections. Additional clinical studies and trials using immunotherapeutic or newly approved agents are also in the planning stage, with the main goals of generating actionable data that will inform clinical decision making and facilitate development of new treatment options for highly resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. © The Author 2017.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa), the most common malignancy in men, is a major cause of cancer deaths. A better understanding of the mechanisms that drive tumor initiation and progression may identify actionable targets to improve treatment of this patient group. As a dietary carotenoid, astaxanthin has been demonstrated to exert beneficial effects against inflammation, cardiovascular disease, oxidative damage, or different cancer sites. This study used intragastric administration of astaxanthin to detect its role on tumor proliferation, apoptosis, microRNA (miRNA) overexpression, and microbacteria composition change by establishing androgen-independent PCa cell PC-3 xenograft nude mice. Nude mice were inoculated with androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells subcutaneously. The intervention was started when tumors reached 0.5-0.6 cm in diameter. Mice were intragastrically administered 100 mg/kg astaxanthin (HA), 25 mg/kg astaxanthin (LA), or olive oil (TC). The results showed that 100 mg/kg astaxanthin significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the TC group, with an inhibitory rate of 41.7%. A decrease of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as well as an increase of cleaved caspase-3 were observed in HA-treated tumors, along with increasing apoptotic cells, obtained by TUNEL assay. The HA significantly elevated the levels of tumor suppressors miR-375 and miR-487b in tumor tissues and the amount of Lactobacillus sp. and Lachnospiraceae in mice stools, while there was no significant difference between LA and TC groups. These results provide a promising regimen to enhance the therapeutic effect in a dietary supplement manner.

AB BACKGROUND: Widespread application of research findings to improve patient outcomes remains inadequate, and failure to routinely translate research findings into daily clinical practice is a major barrier for the implementation of any evidence-based guideline. Strategies to increase guideline uptake in primary care pediatric practices and to facilitate adherence to recommendations are required.; OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to operationalize the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents into a mobile clinical decision support (CDS) system for healthcare providers, and to describe the process development and outcomes.; METHODS: To overcome the difficulty of translating clinical practice guidelines into a computable form that can be used by a CDS system, we used a multilayer framework to convert the evidence synthesis into executable knowledge. We used an iterative process of design, testing, and revision through each step in the translation of the guidelines for use in a CDS tool to support the development of 4 validated modules: an integrated risk assessment; a blood pressure calculator; a body mass index calculator; and a lipid management instrument.; RESULTS: The iterative revision process identified several opportunities to improve the CDS tool. Operationalizing the integrated guideline identified numerous areas in which the guideline was vague or incorrect and required more explicit operationalization. Iterative revisions led to workable solutions to problems and understanding of the limitations of the tool.; CONCLUSIONS: The process and experiences described provide a model for other mobile CDS systems that translate written clinical practice guidelines into actionable, real-time clinical recommendations. ©Robert D.

AB OBJECTIVES: Despite documented increases in emergency department (ED) mental health (MH) presentations, there are inconsistent findings on the characteristics of patients with repeat presentations to pediatric EDs (PEDs) for MH concerns. Our study sought to explore the characteristics of MH patients with repeat PED visits and determine predictors of return visits, of earlier repeat visits, and of more frequent repeat visits.; METHODS: We examined data collected prospectively in a clinical database looking at MH presentations to a crisis intervention program housed within a PED from October 2006 to December 2011. Predictive models based on demographic and clinical variables were constructed using logistic, Cox, and negative binomial regression.; RESULTS: A total of 4,080 presentations to the PED were made by the 2,900 children and youth. Repeat visits accounted for almost half (45.8%) of all presentations. Multivariable analysis identified five variables that independently predicted greater odds of having repeat presentations, greater risk of earlier repeat presentations, and greater risk of frequent repeat presentations. The five variables were: female, living in the metropolitan community close to the PED, being in the care of child protective services, taking psychotropic medications, and presenting with an actionable need in the area of mood disturbances.; CONCLUSIONS: Repeat visits account for a large portion of all MH presentations to the PED. Furthermore, several patient characteristics are significant predictors of repeat PED use and of repeating use sooner and more frequently. Further research is needed to examine interventions targeting this patient group to ensure appropriate MH patient management.

AB In this review, we provide an update on the current and future applications of saliva for diagnostic purposes. There are many advantages of using saliva as a biofluid. Its collection is fast, easy, inexpensive, and non-invasive. In addition, saliva, as a "mirror of the body," can reflect the physiological and pathological state of the body. Therefore, it serves as a diagnostic and monitoring tool in many fields of science such as medicine, dentistry, and pharmacotherapy. Introduced in 2008, the term "Salivaomics" aimed to highlight the rapid development of knowledge about various "omics" constituents of saliva, including: proteome, transcriptome, micro-RNA, metabolome, and microbiome. In the last few years, researchers have developed new technologies and validated a wide range of salivary biomarkers that will soon make the use of saliva a clinical reality. However, a great need still exists for convenient and accurate point-of-care devices that can serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. In addition, there is an urgent need to decipher the scientific rationale and mechanisms that convey systemic diseases to saliva. Another promising technology called liquid biopsy enables detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and fragments of tumor DNA in saliva, thus enabling non-invasive early detection of various cancers. The newly developed technology-electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM) provides near perfect detection of actionable mutations in lung cancer patients. These recent advances widened the salivary diagnostic approach from the oral cavity to the whole physiological system, and thus point towards a promising future of salivary diagnostics for personalized individual medicine applications including clinical decisions and post-treatment outcome predictions. Impact statement The purpose of this mini-review is to make an update about the present and future applications of saliva as a diagnostic biofluid in many fields of science such as dentistry, medicine and pharmacotherapy. Using saliva as a fluid for diagnostic purposes would be a huge breakthrough for both patients and healthcare providers since saliva collection is easy, non-invasive and inexpensive. We will go through the current main diagnostic applications of saliva, and provide a highlight on the emerging, newly developing technologies and tools for cancer screening, detection and monitoring.

AB BACKGROUND: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is quickly becoming the preferred procedure for bariatric surgery. According to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery guidelines, routine preoperative upper gastrointestinal endoscopies are not recommended universally for bariatric surgery. Some studies have shown that the histologic examination of SG specimens is insignificant and not a cost-effective practice. However, some speculate SG examination may unveil pertinent findings and prevent further progression of precursor lesions.; OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the clinically significant or actionable lesions that can be revealed with SG examination.; SETTING: Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA.; RESULTS: We analyzed 511 SG specimens obtained during bariatric surgery. Incidental findings were grouped in 2 categories: clinically significant/actionable and minor lesions. The clinically significant lesions accounted for 5.8%. This category included 5 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor; one case of MALT lymphoma; 4 cases of autoimmune gastritis with concomitant pancreatic metaplasia or neuroendocrine dysplasia. Intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia was identified in 3 cases; 14 cases of Helicobacter pylori associated active gastritis; 1 case of iron pill induced gastritis and 1 case of gastric glandular siderosis. The minor lesions accounted for 6.3%, showing findings other than chronic gastritis. This category included 19 cases of fundic polyps and 1 case of hyperplastic polyp; one case of leiomyoma; 11 cases of H pylori negative active gastritis.; CONCLUSIONS: The majority of histopathology results after SG showed no significant changes. However, a few cases had clinically significant lesions in seemingly healthy patients, altering patient's postoperative management. Copyright © 2017 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Providers are assuming growing responsibility for healthcare spending, and prior studies have shown that spending is concentrated in a small proportion of patients. Using simple methods to segment these patients into clinically meaningful subgroups may be a useful and accessible strategy for targeting interventions to control costs.; METHODS: Using Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2011 (baseline year, used to determine comorbidities and subgroups) and 2012 (spending year), we used basic demographics and comorbidities to group beneficiaries into 6 cohorts, defined by expert opinion and consultation: under-65 disabled/ESRD, frail elderly, major complex chronic, minor complex chronic, simple chronic, and relatively healthy. We considered patients in the highest 10% of spending to be "high-cost."; RESULTS: 611,245 beneficiaries were high-cost; these patients were less often white (76.2% versus 80.9%) and more often dually-eligible (37.0% versus 18.3%). By segment, frail patients were the most likely (46.2%) to be high-cost followed by the under-65 (14.3%) and major complex chronic groups (11.1%); fewer than 5% of the beneficiaries in the other cohorts were high-cost in the spending year. The frail elderly ($70,196) and under-65 disabled/ESRD ($71,210) high-cost groups had the highest spending; spending in the frail high-cost group was driven by inpatient ($23,704) and post-acute care ($24,080), while the under 65-disabled/ESRD spent more through part D costs ($23,003).; CONCLUSIONS: Simple criteria can segment Medicare beneficiaries into clinically meaningful subgroups with different spending profiles.; IMPLICATIONS: Under delivery system reform, interventions that focus on frail or disabled patients may have particularly high value as providers seek to reduce spending.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB Routine mass immunization programs have contributed greatly to the control of infectious diseases and to the improvement of the health of populations. Over the last decades, the rise of antivaccination movements has threatened the advances made in this field to the point that vaccination coverage rates have decreased and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases have resurfaced. One of the critical points of the immunization debate revolves around the level of risk attributable to vaccination, namely the possibility of experiencing serious and possibly irreversible adverse events. Unfortunately, the knowledge about adverse events, especially rare ones, is usually incomplete at best and the attribution of a causal relationship with vaccinations is subject to significant uncertainties. The aim of this paper is to provide a narrative review of seven rare or very rare adverse events: hypotonic hyporesponsive episode, multiple sclerosis, apnea in preterm newborns, Guillain-Barre syndrome, vasculitides, arthritis/ arthralgia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura. We have selected these adverse events based on our experience of questions asked by health care workers involved in vaccination services. Information on the chosen adverse events was retrieved from Medline using appropriate search terms. The review is in the form of questions and answers for each adverse event, with a view to providing useful and actionable concepts while not ignoring the uncertainties that remain. We also highlight in the conclusion possible future improvements to adverse event detection and assessment that could help identify individuals at higher risk against the probable future backdrop of ever-greater abandonment of compulsory vaccination policies.

AB BACKGROUND: There is emergence of resistance to the last-line antibiotics such as carbapenems in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), leaving little effective therapeutic options. Since there are no more newer antibiotics in the armamentarium in the near future, it has become imperative that we harness the interdisciplinary knowledge for the best clinical outcome of the patient.; AIMS: The aim of the conference was to utilize the synergies between the clinical microbiologists and critical care specialists for better patient care and clinical outcome.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combined continuing medical education program (CME) under the aegis of the Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists - Delhi Chapter and the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, Delhi and national capital region was organized to share their expertise on the various topics covering epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of hospital-acquired infections in ICUs.; RESULTS: It was agreed that synergy between the clinical microbiologists and critical care medicine is required in understanding the scope of laboratory tests, investigative pathway testing, hospital epidemiology, and optimum use of antibiotics. A consensus on the use of rapid diagnostics such as point-of-care tests, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and molecular tests for the early diagnosis of infectious disease was made. It was agreed that stewardship activities along with hospital infection control practices should be further strengthened for better utilization of the antibiotics. Through this CME, we identified the barriers and actionables for appropriate antimicrobial usage in Indian ICUs.; CONCLUSIONS: A close coordination between clinical microbiology and critical care medicine opens up avenues to improve antimicrobial prescription practices.

AB Foodborne infection is a result of exposure to complex, dynamic food systems. The efficiency of foodborne infection is driven by ongoing shifts in genetic machinery. Next-generation sequencing technologies can provide high-fidelity data about the genetics of a pathogen. However, food safety surveillance systems do not currently provide similar high-fidelity epidemiological metadata to associate with genetic data. As a consequence, it is rarely possible to transform genetic data into actionable knowledge that can be used to genuinely inform risk assessment or prevent outbreaks. Big data approaches are touted as a revolution in decision support, and pose a potentially attractive method for closing the gap between the fidelity of genetic and epidemiological metadata for food safety surveillance. We therefore developed a simple food chain model to investigate the potential benefits of combining 'big' data sources, including both genetic and high-fidelity epidemiological metadata. Our results suggest that, as for any surveillance system, the collected data must be relevant and characterize the important dynamics of a system if we are to properly understand risk: this suggests the need to carefully consider data curation, rather than the more ambitious claims of big data proponents that unstructured and unrelated data sources can be combined to generate consistent insight. Of interest is that the biggest influencers of foodborne infection risk were contamination load and processing temperature, not genotype. This suggests that understanding food chain dynamics would probably more effectively generate insight into foodborne risk than prescribing the hazard in ever more detail in terms of genotype.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic testing has multigenerational and familial repercussions. However, the "trickle-down effect" of providing genetic counseling and testing to family members at risk after an initial identification of a pathogenic variant in a medically actionable gene has been poorly understood.; METHODS: Three probands were identified during the pharmacogenetics research phase of eMERGEII (electronic MEdical Record and Genomics, phase II) to have variants in genes associated with autosomal dominant adult-onset disorders determined to be actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Two of the three probands had variants that were classified as pathogenic and the third proband had a variant ultimately classified of uncertain significance, but of concern due to the proband's own phenotype. All probands had additional family members at risk for inheriting the variant. Two of the three probands had family members who received their medical care from the same health care system, Group Health Cooperative (GHC). It was recommended that the proband contact their family members at risk to be referred to genetic counseling for consideration of genetic testing.; RESULTS: The two probands with pathogenic variants contacted some of their family members at risk. Individuals contacted included children and adult grandchildren, particularly if they received their medical care at GHC. To the best of our knowledge, siblings and more distant relatives at risk were not informed by the proband of their genetic risk.; CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a family network is essential to disseminate knowledge of genetic risk. These three initial cases describe our experience of contacting eMERGE participants with identified variants, providing the probands with appropriate genetic counseling and care coordination, and recommendations for contacting family members at risk. Greater challenges were observed for coordinating genetics care for family members and extending the family network to include other relatives at risk.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: The treatment of congestive heart failure is an expensive undertaking with much of this cost occurring as a result of hospitalization. It is not surprising that many remote monitoring strategies have been developed to help patients maintain clinical stability by avoiding congestion. Most of these have failed. It seems very unlikely that these failures were the result of any one underlying false assumption but rather from the fact that heart failure is a progressive, deadly disease and that human behavior is hard to modify. One lesson that does stand out from the myriad of methods to detect congestion is that surrogates of congestion, such as weight and impedance, are not reliable or actionable enough to influence outcomes. Too many factors influence these surrogates to successfully and confidently use them to affect HF hospitalization. Surrogates are often attractive because they can be inexpensively measured and followed. They are, however, indirect estimations of congestion, and due to the lack specificity, the time and expense expended affecting the surrogate do not provide enough benefit to warrant its use. We know that high filling pressures cause transudation of fluid into tissues and that pulmonary edema and peripheral edema drive patients to seek medical assistance. Direct measurement of these filling pressures appears to be the sole remote monitoring modality that shows a benefit in altering the course of the disease in these patients. Congestive heart failure is such a serious problem and the consequences of hospitalization so onerous in terms of patient well-being and costs to society that actual hemodynamic monitoring, despite its costs, is beneficial in carefully selected high-risk patients. Those patients who benefit are ones with a prior hospitalization and ongoing New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III symptoms. Patients with NYHA class I and II symptoms do not require hemodynamic monitoring because they largely have normal hemodynamics. Those with NYHA class IV symptoms do not benefit because their hemodynamics are so deranged that they cannot be substantially altered except by mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation. Finally, hemodynamic monitoring offers substantial hope to those patients with normal ejection fraction (EF) heart failure, a large group for whom medical therapy has largely been a failure. These patients have not benefited from the neurohormonal revolution that improved the lives of their brothers and sisters with reduced ejection fractions. Hemodynamic stabilization improves the condition of both but more so of the normal EF cohort. This is an important observation that will help us design future trials for the 50% of heart failure patients with normal systolic function.

AB Biobank research has the potential to return results that could have beneficial and even life-saving consequences for participants. This possibility raises some important questions, not only about the ethical duty to return results within a research setting, but also about participants' right to refuse results and researchers' responsibility to respect that choice. This article argues in favor of adopting a return-of-results policy that limits participants' ability to refuse clinically relevant and actionable results. We state that biobanks should allow donors only if they are aware of and agree to this return policy. If they do not agree to this, they retain the option not to participate in the biobank research. The aim of this article is to discuss the practical and ethical reasons in favor of this return-of-result policy and, thus, to underline the importance of "honesty" in biobanking regulations.

AB BACKGROUND: Advances in genomics have led to calls for returning information about medically actionable genes (MAGs) to patients, research subjects, biobank participants, and through screening programs, the general adult population. Which MAGs are returned affects the harms and benefits of every genetic testing endeavor. Despite published recommendations of selection criteria for MAGs to return, scant data exist regarding how decision makers actually apply such criteria.; METHODS: The process and criteria used by researchers when selecting MAGs for a preventive genomic sequencing program targeting the general adult population were examined. The authors observed and audio-recorded the gene selection meetings, and analyzed meeting transcripts, gene scoring sheets, and meeting handouts.; RESULTS: To select MAGs, the committee imported, from a preexisting project, "a semiquantitative metric" that scores genes on five criteria. Numerous subjective judgments and conceptual challenges in defining and applying the five criteria complicated the selection process. Criteria-related challenges also included the limited evidence available about facts fundamental to the scoring decisions and the emergence and application of criteria that were not part of the original metric.; CONCLUSIONS: When identifying MAGs appropriate for screening and return, decision makers must expect and prepare to address such issues as the inevitability of subjective judgments, limited evidence about fundamental decision-making elements, the conceptual complexity of defining criteria, and the emergence of unplanned criteria during the gene selection process.

AB OBJECTIVES: To prevent opioid-related mortality, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) developed a national Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program.; SETTING: VHA's OEND program sought national implementation of OEND across all medical facilities (n= 142).; PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: This paper describes VHA's efforts to facilitate nationwide health care system-based OEND implementation, including the critical roles of VHA's national pharmacy services and academic detailing services.; PRACTICE INNOVATION: VHA is the first large health care system in the United States to implement OEND nationwide. Launching the national program required VHA to translate a primarily community-based public health approach to OEND into a health care system-based approach that distributed naloxone to patients with opioid use disorders as well as to patients prescribed opioid analgesics. Key innovations included developing steps to implement OEND, pharmacy developing standard naloxone rescue kits, adding those kits to the VHA National Formulary, centralizing kit distribution, developing clinical guidance for issuing naloxone kits, and supporting OEND as a focal campaign of academic detailing. Other innovations included the development of patient and provider education resources (e.g., brochures, videos, accredited training) and implementation and evaluation resources (e.g., technical assistance, clinical decision support tools).; EVALUATION: Clinical decision support tools that leverage VHA national data are available to clinical staff with appropriate permissions. These tools allow staff and leaders to evaluate OEND implementation and provide actionable next steps to help them identify patients who could benefit from OEND.; RESULTS: Through fiscal year 2016, VHA dispensed 45,178 naloxone prescriptions written by 5693 prescribers to 39,328 patients who were primarily prescribed opioids or had opioid use disorder. As of February 2, 2016, there were 172 spontaneously reported opioid overdose reversals with the use of VHA naloxone prescriptions.; CONCLUSION: VHA has successfully translated community-based OEND into health care system-based OEND targeting 2 patient populations. There is a tremendous amount that can be learned from VHA's experience implementing this novel health care innovation nationwide. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: In this study, we aimed to validate our extensive preclinical data on phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) as actionable target in B-cell malignancies. Our specific objectives were to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (PI3K/AKT activity), as well as to capture any potential antitumor activity of the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast in combination with prednisone in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies.Experimental Design: Single-center, exploratory phase Ib open-label, nonrandomized study. Roflumilast (500 mcg PO) was given daily for 21 days with prednisone on days 8 to 14. Additional 21-day cycles were started if patients tolerated cycle 1 and had at least stable disease.Results: Ten patients, median age 65 years with an average of three prior therapies, were enrolled. The median number of cycles administered was 4 (range, 1-13). Treatment was well tolerated; the most common ≥grade 2 treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, anorexia (≥25%), and transient ≥ grade 2 neutropenia (30%). Treatment with roflumilast as a single agent significantly suppressed PI3K activity in the 77% of patients evaluated; on average, patients with PI3K/AKT suppression stayed in trial for 156 days (49-315) versus 91 days (28-139 days) for those without this biomarker response. Six of the nine evaluable patients (66%) had partial response or stable disease. The median number of days in trial was 105 days (range, 28-315).Conclusions: Repurposing the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast for treatment of B-cell malignancies is safe, suppresses the oncogenic PI3K/AKT kinases, and may be clinically active.

AB BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, progress in prevention and treatment of caries and periodontal diseases has been translated to better oral health and improved tooth retention in the adult population. The ageing population and the increasing expectations of good oral health-related quality of life in older age pose formidable challenges to clinical care and healthcare systems.; AIMS: The objective of this workshop was to critically review scientific evidence and develop specific recommendations to: (i) prevent tooth loss and retain oral function through prevention and treatment of caries and periodontal diseases later in life and (ii) increase awareness of the health benefits of oral health as an essential component of healthy ageing.; METHODS: Discussions were initiated by three systematic reviews covering aspects of epidemiology of caries and periodontal diseases in elders, the impact of senescence on caries and periodontal diseases and the effectiveness of interventions. Recommendations were developed based on evidence from the systematic reviews and expert opinion.; RESULTS: Key messages included: (i) the ageing population, trends in risk factors and improved tooth retention point towards an expected increase in the total burden of disease posed by caries and periodontal diseases in the older population; (ii) specific surveillance is required to monitor changes in oral health in the older population; (iii) senescence impacts oral health including periodontitis and possibly caries susceptibility; (iv) evidence indicates that caries and periodontal diseases can be prevented and treated also in older adults; (v) oral health and functional tooth retention later in life provides benefits both in terms of oral and general quality of life and in terms of preventing physical decline and dependency by fostering a healthy diet; (vi) oral healthcare professionals and individuals should not base decisions impacting tooth retention on chronological age but on level of dependency, life expectancy, frailty, comfort and quality of life; and (vii) health policy should remove barriers to oral health care for vulnerable elders.; CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was reached on specific actionable priorities for public health officials, oral healthcare professionals, educators and workforce planners, caregivers and relatives as well as for the public and ageing patients. Some priorities have major implications for policymakers as health systems need to adapt to the challenge by systemwide changes to enable (promote) tooth retention later in life and management of deteriorating oral health in increasingly dependent elders. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with the majority of mortality resulting from metastatic spread. However, the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells acquire the ability to disseminate from primary tumors, seed distant organs, and grow into tissue-destructive metastases remains incompletely understood. We combined tumor barcoding in a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma with unbiased genomic approaches to identify a transcriptional program that confers metastatic ability and predicts patient survival. Small-scale in vivo screening identified several genes, including Cd109, that encode novel pro-metastatic factors. We uncovered signaling mediated by Janus kinases (Jaks) and the transcription factor Stat3 as a critical, pharmacologically targetable effector of CD109-driven lung cancer metastasis. In summary, by coupling the systematic genomic analysis of purified cancer cells in distinct malignant states from mouse models with extensive human validation, we uncovered several key regulators of metastatic ability, including an actionable pro-metastatic CD109-Jak-Stat3 axis.

AB The medical examiner/coroner (ME/C) death scene investigation systems of the United States play a pivotal role in the current public health crisis created by the expanding drug dependency epidemic in the United States. The first point of recognition of a drug-related death in a community is often the local ME/C agency. This circumstance places these entities in an ideal position to provide surveillance data regarding the epidemiology of drug-related deaths occurring within the jurisdiction of the agency. The ability to surveil for the distribution and determinants among drug-related deaths at the first point of contact enhances the capacity to recognize actionable trends at the local, state, and national levels, including the ability to identify secular (longer-term) trends among various drugs and population subgroups, as well as activity spikes (outbreaks) associated with high-potency formulations and drug combinations. In this article, we describe the development and implementation of an online website that provides public access to a wide array of drug-related death surveillance resources and tools. The website gives users access to a detailed dataset that includes information regarding specific drugs, demographic information pertaining to the decedent, and to investigational findings related to the circumstances of the death. A unique aspect of the database is that it is populated by ME/C agencies and accessed by the public with no intermediary agency, so that the lag time between the identification and investigation of the death as drug-related and community knowledge of the circumstances of the death is minimized. Wide dissemination of accurate drug death surveillance information in an easily accessible and customizable format promotes societal awareness of the drug death epidemic, but also provides information to public health, law enforcement, regulatory, and other community-based organizations that can benefit from the most up-to-date knowledge. We envision a national system of surveillance at the regional ME/C level that would allow for optimal information dissemination and sharing. Such a system would likely allow for more efficacious allocation of resources at the regional and national level.

AB Multiple national reports identify actionable recommendations to transform education and practice to meet the needs of health care and healthcare delivery beyond the hospital walls. The Josiah Macy Jr. Conference (2016) focused on transforming primary care and changing healthcare culture to support expansion of roles for registered nurses (RNs). Partnerships between academia and clinical practice are critical to expanding learning opportunities beyond traditional acute care settings. Development of primary care expertise in nursing faculty and adjunct faculty, in collaboration with primary care and ambulatory care nursing leaders, is essential. Academic-practice partnerships must advocate for removing regulatory and practice barriers to allow RNs to practice to the full scope of education and training. Recommendations from national reports extend beyond enhanced roles in primary care practice and have global implications for all RNs practicing in ambulatory care.

AB BACKGROUND: The ubiquity of the Internet is changing the way people obtain their health information. Although there is an abundance of heart failure information online, the quality and health literacy demand of these information are still unknown.; OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality and health literacy demand (readability, understandability, and actionability) of the heart failure information found online.; METHODS: Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask.com, and DuckDuckGo were searched for relevant heart failure Web sites. Two independent raters then assessed the quality and health literacy demand of the included Web sites. The quality of the heart failure information was assessed using the DISCERN instrument. Readability was assessed using 7 established readability tests. Finally, understandability and actionability were assessed using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print Materials.; RESULTS: A total of 46 Web sites were included in this analysis. The overall mean quality rating was 46.0 ± 8.9 and the mean readability score was 12.6 grade reading level. The overall mean understandability score was 56.3% ± 16.2%. Finally, the overall mean actionability score was 34.7% ± 28.7%.; CONCLUSIONS: The heart failure information found online was of fair quality but required a relatively high health literacy level. Web content authors need to consider not just the quality but also the health literacy demand of the information found in their Web sites. This is especially important considering that low health literacy is likely prevalent among the usual audience.

AB INTRODUCTION: While healthcare expenditure continues to increase overall health outcomes in the United States continue to be submarginal. The changes we make in our healthcare system need to be informed by a comprehensive and actionable definition of healththat canunite patients, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.; METHODS: A literature review across multiple disciplines was conducted to assess a broad range of factors associated with health and well-being and based on this literature review a novel definition of health was developed.; RESULTS: Development of a definition of health as the ability to dynamically recognize and resolve dissonance in one's physical, mental, social and spiritual worlds via cooperation with social and spiritual connections, the medical community and with the natural world in a way that fosters and promotes harmony, resilience, and relief from suffering. This definition is then expanded into six domains (connection, communication, creativity, cooperation, cost-consciousness, and computerization) which are applicableto individuals, society and the healthcare system and which form the basis for actionableguidelines to promotemeasurable and sustained change on a public health scale.; CONCLUSION: Healthcare in the United States is changing and in order to move forward in an evidence-based and compassionate way, we need to understand what we mean by 'health' and how that definition can be operational atindividual, societal, and public policy levels.

AB Globally, an increasing and aging population is contributing to the prevalence of cancer. To be effective, cancer care needs to involve the coordination of multidisciplinary specialties, and also needs to be affordable, accessible, and capable of producing optimal patient outcomes. Porter and Teisberg (2006) have postulated that shifting current healthcare strategies from volume-based to patient-centric care redirects economic competition to providing treatments which promote the best patient outcomes while driving down costs. Therefore, the value in value-based healthcare (VBH) is defined as patient outcome per currency spent on providing care. Based on the experiences of healthcare organizations currently transitioning to the value-based system, this review details actionable guidelines to transition current cancer care practices to the value-based system in four main steps: by defining universal clinical and patient-reported measures, creating cancer-specific units that provide the full care cycle, establishing a data capture model to routinely determine the value of the care delivered, and continually improving treatment strategies through research. As healthcare providers in more developed countries move to value-based care, those located in lessdeveloped countries should also be assisted in their transition to relieve the cancer burden globally.

AB Health is not defined by the absence of disease or suffering, but by response to a series of life events that can markedly alter the quality and quantity of life. Patients with cancer experience significant but dynamic physical, psychosocial, and financial challenges. With the increasing number of patients with early stage cancers transitioning to survivorship, there is a critical need to address health promotion and overall well-being. For those with advanced cancer, discussion about prognosis and early integration of palliative care can have a profound impact on the quality of life. Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is important in aligning treatment recommendations with patient goals and preferences throughout cancer therapy. This review provides a dynamic definition of health and proposes actionable guidelines for health promotion at any point along the cancer continuum: survivorship after early cancer or when goals of care transition to improve quality at the end of life.

AB Genomic medicine attempts to build individualized strategies for diagnostic or therapeutic decision-making by utilizing patients' genomic information. Big Data analytics uncovers hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and other insights through examining large-scale various data sets. While integration and manipulation of diverse genomic data and comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs) on a Big Data infrastructure exhibit challenges, they also provide a feasible opportunity to develop an efficient and effective approach to identify clinically actionable genetic variants for individualized diagnosis and therapy. In this paper, we review the challenges of manipulating large-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and diverse clinical data derived from the EHRs for genomic medicine. We introduce possible solutions for different challenges in manipulating, managing, and analyzing genomic and clinical data to implement genomic medicine. Additionally, we also present a practical Big Data toolset for identifying clinically actionable genetic variants using high-throughput NGS data and EHRs.

AB Previous precision medicine studies have investigated conventional molecular techniques and/or limited sets of gene alterations. The aim of this study was to describe the impact of the next-generation sequencing of the largest panel of genes used to date in tumour tissue and blood in the context of institutional molecular screening programmes. DNA analysis was performed by next-generation sequencing using a panel of 426 cancer-related genes and by comparative genomic hybridization from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded archived tumour samples when available or from fresh tumour samples. Five hundred sixty-eight patients were enrolled. The median number of prior lines of treatment was 2 (range 0-9). The most common primary tumour types were lung (16.9%), colorectal (14.4%), breast (10.6%), ovarian (10.2%) and sarcoma (10.2%). The median patient age was 63years (range 19-88). A total of 292 patients (51.4%) presented with at least one actionable genetic alteration. The 20 genes most frequently altered were TP53, CDKN2A, KRAS, PTEN, PI3KCA, RB1, APC, ERBB2, MYC, EGFR, CDKN2B, ARID1A, SMAD4, FGFR1, MDM2, BRAF, ATM, CCNE1, FGFR3 and FRS2. One hundred fifty-nine patients (28%) were included in early phase trials. The treatment was matched with a tumour profile in 86 cases (15%). The two main reasons for non-inclusion were non-progressive disease (31.5%) and general status deterioration (25%). Twenty-eight percent of patients presented with a growth modulation index (time to progression under the early phase trial treatment/time to progression of the previous line of treatment) >1.3.Extensive molecular profiling using high-throughput techniques allows for the identification of actionable mutations in the majority of cases and is associated with substantial clinical benefit in up to one in four patients.

AB BACKGROUND: New patients are a particularly vulnerable population because they are at high risk of missing a subsequent visit or dropping out of care completely. However, few data exist on what new patients value in the beginning of a relationship with a new provider. Persons with HIV infection may be an ideal population to study the drivers of a positive initial patient-provider relationship, as it is a chronic and serious condition that requires a reliable, ongoing relationship with a provider. Informed by patients' real experiences, this study aims to identify what patients see as the most critical elements for building trust and rapport from the outset.; METHODS: We conducted longitudinal, in-person interviews with 21 patients new to the HIV clinic at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, Texas, from August 2013 to March 2015. Patients were interviewed across three time points: once before their first provider visit, a second time within two weeks after the first visit, and a third time at 6 to 12months after the first provider visit.; RESULTS: We conducted 61h of patient interviews. The mean age was 53years; 52% were non-Hispanic white, 23% were non-Hispanic black and 19% were Hispanic. Patients described significant anxiety and vulnerability not just from HIV itself, but also in starting a relationship as a new patient to a new provider. Our analysis of these experiences revealed five actions providers can take to reduce their patients' anxiety and build trust early in the first visit: 1) provide reassurance to patients, 2) tell patients it's okay to ask questions, 3) show patients their lab results and explain what they mean, 4) avoid language and behaviors that are judgmental of patients, and 5) ask patients what they want [i.e., treatment goals and preferences].; CONCLUSIONS: Our study incorporates direct input from patients and highlights the unique psychological challenges that patients face in seeking care from a new provider. The actionable opportunities cited by patients have the potential to mitigate patients' feelings of anxiety and vulnerability, and thereby improve their overall health care experience.

AB BACKGROUND: We investigated provider and regional variation in payments made to surgeons by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) by indexing payments to unique beneficiaries treated and examined the proportion of charges that resulted in payments. Understanding variation in care within CMS may prove actionable by identifying modifiable, and potentially unwarranted, variations.; METHODS: We analyzed the Medicare Part B Provider Utilization and Payment Data released by CMS for 2012. We included Medicare B participants in the fee-for-service program. We calculated for each provider the ratio of number of services provided to individual beneficiaries, and the ratio of total submitted charges to total Medicare payments. We also categorized each provider into deciles of total Medicare payments, and calculated the means per decile of total Medicare payment for surgeons and urologists. To determine any associations with ratio of services to beneficiaries, we conducted multivariate linear regressions.; RESULTS: The 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles for the services-per-beneficiary ratios are 1.6, 2.2, 3.1, and 5.0, respectively (n=83,376). Greater-earning surgeons offered more services per beneficiary, with a precipitous increase from the lowest decile to the highest. Charges were consistently greater than payments by a factor of 3. In our multivariate analysis of services per beneficiary ratio, female providers had lower ratios (P<.01), and we noted significant regional variation in the ratio of services per unique beneficiary (P<.001 for each of the 10 Standard Federal Regions).; CONCLUSION: We found significant variation in patterns of payments for surgical care in CMS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, continues to present diagnostic challenges. Newborn screening and an evolving understanding of CF genetics have prompted a reconsideration of the diagnosis criteria.; STUDY DESIGN: To improve diagnosis and achieve standardized definitions worldwide, the CF Foundation convened a committee of 32 experts in CF diagnosis from 9 countries to develop clear and actionable consensus guidelines on the diagnosis of CF and to clarify diagnostic criteria and terminology for other disorders associated with CFTR mutations. An a priori threshold of≥80% affirmative votes was required for acceptance of each recommendation statement.; RESULTS: After reviewing relevant literature, the committee convened to review evidence and cases. Following the conference, consensus statements were developed by an executive subcommittee. The entire consensus committee voted and approved 27 of 28 statements, 7 of which needed revisions and a second round of voting.; CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that diagnoses associated with CFTR mutations in all individuals, from newborn to adult, be established by evaluation of CFTR function with a sweat chloride test. The latest mutation classifications annotated in the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR project (http://www.cftr2.org/index.php) should be used to aid in diagnosis. Newborns with a high immunoreactive trypsinogen level and inconclusive CFTR functional and genetic testing may be designated CFTR-related metabolic syndrome or CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis; these terms are now merged and equivalent, and CFTR-related metabolic syndrome/CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis may be used. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision codes for use in diagnoses associated with CFTR mutations are included. Copyright © 2016.

AB 'Does it work?' is not the only question that practical improvers have of those investigating of quality improvements. They also want to know, 'Will it work here? What conditions do we need to implement and sustain it? Can we adapt it? How much will it cost and save? Is there enough evidence to spread it?'This perspectives article describes methods that investigators can use to answer these questions about improvement changes and improvement methods. It suggests that one reason why research is underused by improvers is because there is little research that answers these questions that would enable improvers to decide whether or how to implement an improvement in their local setting. It shows improvers that answers are possible and where improvers might find research and reports which answer these questions. It is based on reviews of research and reports about methods for producing valid and actionable knowledge to answer these questions. It describes a new 'quality improvement investigation movement' which is uniting applied researchers and improvers to use innovative methods to answer these questions. These investigators recognize the strengths of the randomized controlled trail method, and how easy it is to draw the wrong conclusions from data generated using lower cost and more timely methods. It emphasizes how investigators can choose a method suited to each question, describe the limitations of the method and communicate to improvers the degree of certainty of their answers to the questions. © The Author 2016.

AB BACKGROUND: Appendiceal cancers are rare and consist of carcinoid, mucocele, pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), goblet cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma histologies. Current treatment involves surgical resection or debulking, but no standard exists for adjuvant chemotherapy or treatment for metastatic disease.; METHODS: Samples were identified from approximately 60,000 global tumors analyzed at a referral molecular profiling CLIA-certified laboratory. A total of 588 samples with appendix primary tumor sites were identified (male/female ratio of 2:3; mean age =55). Sixty-two percent of samples were adenocarcinomas (used for analysis); the rest consisted of 9% goblet cell, 15% mucinous; 6% pseudomyxoma, and less than 5% carcinoids and 2% neuroendocrine. Tests included sequencing [Sanger, next generation sequencing (NGS)], protein expression/immunohistochemistry (IHC), and gene amplification [fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or CISH].; RESULTS: Profiling across all appendiceal cancer histological subtypes for IHC revealed: 97% BRCP, 81% MRP1, 81% COX-2, 71% MGMT, 56% TOPO1, 5% PTEN, 52% EGFR, 40% ERCC1, 38% SPARC, 35% PDGFR, 35% TOPO2A, 25% RRM1, 21% TS, 16% cKIT, and 12% for TLE3. NGS revealed mutations in the following genes: 50.4% KRAS, 21.9% P53, 17.6% GNAS, 16.5% SMAD4, 10% APC, 7.5% ATM, 5.5% PIK3CA, 5.0% FBXW7, and 1.8% BRAF.; CONCLUSIONS: Appendiceal cancers show considerable heterogeneity with high levels of drug resistance proteins (BCRP and MRP1), which highlight the difficulty in treating these tumors and suggest an individualized approach to treatment. The incidence of low TS (79%) could be used as a backbone of therapy (using inhibitors such as 5FU/capecitabine or newer agents). Therapeutic options includeTOPO1 inhibitors (irinotecan/topotecan), EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, cetuximab), PDGFR antagonists (regorafenib, axitinib), MGMT (temozolomide). Clinical trials targeting pathways involving KRAS, p53, GNAS, SMAD4, APC, ATM, PIK3CA, FBXW7, and BRAF may be also considered. Overall, appendiceal cancers have similar patterns in their molecular profile to pancreatic cancers (can we say this, any statistical analysis done?) and have differential expression from colorectal cancers. These findings indicate the need to evaluate patient samples for patterns in marker expression and alteration, in order to better understand the molecular biology and formulate a personalized therapy approach in these difficult to treat cancers (supported by a grant from Caris Life Sciences).

AB Dramatic advances have been made in the understanding of cancer over the past decade. Prime among those are better appreciation of the biology of cancer and the development of targeted therapies. Despite these improvements, however, most tumors remain refractory to anti-cancer medications and frequently recur. Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs), which in some cases express markers of pluripotency (e.g., Oct-4), share many of the molecular features of normal stem cells. These cells have been hypothesised to play a role in tumor resistance and relapse. They exhibit dependence on many primitive regulatory pathways and may be best viewed in the context of embryonic signaling pathways. In this article, we review important embryonic signaling cascades and their differential expression in CSCs. We also discuss these pathways as actionable targets for novel therapies in hopes that eliminating cancer stem cells will lead to an improvement in overall survival for patients.

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer with an overall 5-year survival rate less than 5% due to the poor early diagnosis and lack of effective therapeutic options. The most effective therapy remains surgery, however post-operative survival could be enhanced with effective adjuvant therapy. The massive information gained from Omics techniques on PDAC at the beginning of the 21st century is a remarkable accomplishment. However, the information gained from the omics data, including next generation sequencing data, has yet to successfully affect care of patients suffering with PDAC. Therefore, we propose the development of an actionable genomic platform that matches a patient's PDAC clinically actionable genes with potential targeted adjuvant therapies. Using this platform, PDX1 has been identified as a potential actionable gene for PDAC, therefore, RNAi therapy, gene therapy and small inhibitory drugs, all targeting PDX1, serve as potential targeted adjuvant therapies. Preclinical studies support the hypothesis that identification of PDAC actionable genes could permit translation of a patient's genomic information into precision targeted adjuvant therapy for PDAC.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of clinically meaningful change in functional disability in low-income Hispanic patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the US.; METHODS: We evaluated 156 low-socioeconomic status, uninsured, largely immigrant Hispanic patients, collectively described as vulnerable patients, on 3 consecutive visits (baseline, 6, and 12 months followup) at a single center. Disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] disability index [DI]), pain (visual analog scale), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) were assessed each time. Disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28] using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate), serology results, radiographs, treatments, and irreversible articular damage were also recorded.; RESULTS: At baseline, 71% had significant disability (HAQ DI >1), and 34% were depressed. HAQ DI improved significantly over time (P=0.032), and absence of depression (PHQ-9 <10), lower pain, lack of erosions, and no biologic agent use at baseline all predicted the greatest improvement (P<0.001). Baseline to 12-month HAQ DI recovery exceeding the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) occurred in 42% of patients. Recovery was associated with concurrent improvements in DAS28, pain, and PHQ-9 scores (albeit below their respective MCIDs), as well as with absence of erosions. Notably, isolated shifts in PHQ-9 or pain scores over MCID were sufficient to yield clinically meaningful HAQ DI changes.; CONCLUSION: Results suggest that disease activity, depression, and pain are modifiable parameters with consistent, significant, independent, and additive contributions to HAQ DI changes across the disease trajectory in vulnerable Hispanic patients with RA. Their improvement over time, collectively or in isolation, may yield clinically measurable improvements in functional disability and reaffirms these parameters as actionable items in a patient-centered treat-to-target approach. © 2016, American College of Rheumatology.

AB Health disparities persist despite ongoing efforts. Given the United States' rapidly changing demography and socio-cultural diversity, a paradigm shift in behavioral medicine is needed to advance research and interventions focused on health equity. This paper introduces the ConNECT Framework as a model to link the sciences of behavioral medicine and health equity with the goal of achieving equitable health and outcomes in the twenty-first century. We first evaluate the state of health equity efforts in behavioral medicine science and identify key opportunities to advance the field. We then discuss and present actionable recommendations related to ConNECT's five broad and synergistic principles: (1) Integrating Context; (2) Fostering a Norm of Inclusion; (3) Ensuring Equitable Diffusion of Innovations; (4) Harnessing Communication Technology; and (5) Prioritizing Specialized Training. The framework holds significant promise for furthering health equity and ushering in a new and refreshing era of behavioral medicine science and practice.

AB OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of imaging clinical decision support (CDS) varies. Our objective was to identify CDS factors contributing to imaging order cancellation or modification.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This pre-post study was performed across four institutions participating in the Medicare Imaging Demonstration. The intervention was CDS at order entry for selected outpatient imaging procedures. On the basis of the information entered, computerized alerts indicated to providers whether orders were not covered by guidelines, appropriate, of uncertain appropriateness, or inappropriate according to professional society guidelines. Ordering providers could override or accept CDS. We considered actionable alerts to be those that could generate an immediate order behavior change in the ordering physician (i.e., cancellation of inappropriate orders or modification of orders of uncertain appropriateness that had a recommended alternative). Chi-square and logistic regression identified predictors of order cancellation or modification after an alert.; RESULTS: A total of 98,894 radiology orders were entered (83,114 after the intervention). Providers ignored 98.9%, modified 1.1%, and cancelled 0.03% of orders in response to alerts. Actionable alerts had a 10 fold higher rate of modification (8.1% vs 0.7%; p < 0.0001) or cancellation (0.2% vs 0.02%; p < 0.0001) orders compared with nonactionable alerts. Orders from institutions with preexisting imaging CDS had a sevenfold lower rate of cancellation or modification than was seen at sites with newly implemented CDS (1.4% vs 0.2%; p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, actionable alerts were 12 times more likely to result in order cancellation or modification. Orders at sites with preexisting CDS were 7.7 times less likely to be cancelled or modified (p < 0.0001).; CONCLUSION: Using results from the Medicare Imaging Demonstration project, we identified potential factors that were associated with CDS effect on provider imaging ordering; these findings may have implications for future design of such computerized systems.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic alterations that activate the MAPK signaling pathway frequently occur in Type I Epithelial Ovarian Cancers (EOCs). We evaluated therapeutic response outcomes in patients with type I EOC treated with genotype-matched therapy on clinical trials enrolled in a prospective molecular profiling program.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissues were prospectively screened for genomic alterations using MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometry platform or targeted sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel. Treatment outcomes on genotype-matched trials were retrospectively reviewed using RECIST version 1.1 and Gynecological Cancer Intergroup CA125 related-response criteria RESULTS: 55 patients with type I EOC underwent molecular profiling, 41 (75%) low grade serous (LGS), 9 (16%) clear cell (CC), and 5 (9%) mucinous (MC) histologies. Thirty-five patients (64%) were found to have ≥1 somatic mutations: 23 KRAS, 6 NRAS, 5 PIK3CA, 2 PTEN, 1 BRAF, 1 AKT, 1 TP53, and 1 CTNNB1. Fifteen patients were subsequently enrolled in genotype-matched phase I or II trials, including 14 patients with KRAS/NRAS mutations treated with MEK inhibitor targeted combinations. Among 14 RECIST evaluable patients, there were 7 partial responses (PR), 7 stable disease (SD) and 1 disease progression (PD). CA125 responses were observed in 10/10 evaluable KRAS/NRAS mutant patients treated with MEK inhibitor combinations CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping and targeted sequencing of Type I EOCs frequently identifies actionable mutations. Matched treatment with MEK-based combination therapy in KRAS and/or NRAS mutant type I EOC patients is an active therapeutic strategy. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Injury and violence prevention strategies have greater potential for impact when they are based on scientific evidence. Systematic reviews of the scientific evidence can contribute key information about which policies and programs might have the greatest impact when implemented. However, systematic reviews have limitations, such as lack of implementation guidance and contextual information, that can limit the application of knowledge. "Technical packages," developed by knowledge brokers such as the federal government, nonprofit agencies, and academic institutions, have the potential to be an efficient mechanism for making information from systematic reviews actionable. Technical packages provide information about specific evidence-based prevention strategies, along with the estimated costs and impacts, and include accompanying implementation and evaluation guidance to facilitate adoption, implementation, and performance measurement. We describe how systematic reviews can inform the development of technical packages for practitioners, provide examples of technical packages in injury and violence prevention, and explain how enhancing review methods and reporting could facilitate the use and applicability of scientific evidence.

AB Importance: Recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer is usually incurable. Implementation of precision oncology for these patients has been limited by incomplete understanding of the molecular alterations underlying advanced disease. At the same time, the molecular profiles of many rare head and neck cancer types are unknown. These significant gaps in knowledge need to be addressed to rationally devise new therapies.; Objective: To illuminate the distinct biology of recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancers and review implementation of precision oncology for patients with advanced disease.; Design, Setting, and Participants: After exclusions, 151 patients with advanced, treatment-resistant head and neck tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), and other salivary and cutaneous cancers, whose tumors were sequenced between January 2014 and July 2015 at Memorial Sloan Kettering were recruited. Next-generation sequencing of tumors as part of clinical care included high-depth (median 600*) exonic coverage of 410 cancer genes and whole-genome copy number analysis.; Interventions: Next-generation sequencing of tumors and matched normal DNA.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Feasibility, the frequency of actionable molecular alterations, the effect on decision making, and identification of alterations associated with recurrent and metastatic disease.; Results: Overall, 151 patients (95 men and 56 women; mean [range] age, 61.8 [17-100] years) were included in the study. Next-generation sequencing ultimately guided therapy in 21 of 151 patients (14%) (13 of 53 [25%] of patients with HNSCC) by refining diagnoses and matching patients to specific therapies, in some cases with dramatic responses on basket studies. Molecular alterations were potentially actionable in 28 of 135 patients (21%). The genetic profiles of recurrent and metastatic tumors were often distinct from primary tumors. Compared to primary human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tumors, many recurrent and metastatic HPV-positive tumors exhibited a molecular profile more similar to HPV-negative tumors, including enriched frequencies of TP53 mutation (3 of 20 tumors [15%]), whole genome duplication (5 of 20 tumors [25%]), and 3p deletion (11 of 20 tumors [55%]). There were high rates of TERT promoter mutation in recurrent and metastatic HPV-negative HNSCC (13 of 30 tumors [43%]), cutaneous SCC (11 of 21 tumors [52%]), basal cell carcinoma (3 of 4 tumors [75%]), and ACC (5 of 36 tumors [14%]). Activating NOTCH1 mutations were enriched in metastatic ACCs (8 of 36 tumors [22%]).; Conclusions and Relevance: These findings reveal the molecular landscape of advanced disease and rare cancer subtypes, both predominant challenges in head and neck oncology. To understand the repertoire of targetable alterations in advanced cancers, it is necessary to sequence recurrent and metastatic tumors. These data are important first steps toward implementation of precision head and neck oncology.

AB Renal cell cancer (RCC) is characterized by histological and molecular heterogeneity that may account for variable response to targeted therapies. We evaluated retrospectively with a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach using a pre-designed cancer panel the mutation burden of 32 lesions from 22 metastatic RCC patients treated with at least one tyrosine kinase or mTOR inhibitor. We identified mutations in the VHL, PTEN, JAK3, MET, ERBB4, APC, CDKN2A, FGFR3, EGFR, RB1, TP53 genes. Somatic alterations were correlated with response to therapy. Most mutations hit VHL1 (31,8%) followed by PTEN (13,6%), JAK3, FGFR and TP53 (9% each). Eight (36%) patients were wild-type at least for the genes included in the panel.A genotype concordance between primary RCC and its secondary lesion was found in 3/6 cases. Patients were treated with Sorafenib, Sunitinib and Temsirolimus with partial responses in 4 (18,2%) and disease stabilization in 7 (31,8%). Among the 4 partial responders, 1 (25%) was wild-type and 3 (75%) harbored different VHL1 variants. Among the 7 patients with disease stabilization 2 (29%) were wild-type, 2 (29%) PTEN mutated, and single patients (14% each) displayed mutations in VHL1, JAK3 and APC/CDKN2A. Among the 11 non-responders 7 (64%) were wild-type, 2 (18%) were p53 mutated and 2 (18%) VHL1 mutated.No significant associations were found among RCC histotype, mutation variants and response to therapies. In the absence of predictive biomarkers for metastatic RCC treatment, a NGS approach may address single patients to basket clinical trials according to actionable molecular specific alterations.

AB BACKGROUND: Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL), the most common lymphoma of the eye, is a rare form of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). Most frequently a high-grade diffuse large B cell lymphoma, VRL can cause vision loss and its prognosis remains dismal: the overall survival time is 3 years after diagnosis. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used but remain frequently ineffective, and no standardized treatment regimen exists. Furthermore, no biologically targeted treatments, based on the genetic profile of the tumor, are available, as VRL has hitherto not comprehensively been profiled. To address these unmet needs, we hypothesized that a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based, National Cancer Institute (NCI) MATCH Trial-modified panel would be able to identify actionable genomic alterations from small-volume, intraocular liquid biopsies.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective study, we collected diluted vitreous biopsies from 4 patients with a high suspicion for VRL. Following cytological confirmation of lymphoma (all were diffuse large B cell lymphomas), we subjected genomic DNA from the biopsies to NGS, using a panel containing 126 genes (3,435 amplicons across several hotspots per gene), which was modified from that of the NCI MATCH Trial, a new trial that has matched patients with cancers that have not responded (or never responded), to investigational therapeutics based on their prioritized mutation profile rather than site of tumor origin. Using a validated bioinformatics pipeline, we assessed for the presence of actionable mutations and copy number alterations. In all four small-volume, intraocular liquid biopsies, we obtained sufficient genomic DNA for analysis, even in diluted samples in which the undiluted vitreous was used for cytology and flow cytometry. Using NGS, we found targetable heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the MYD88 oncogene, and confirmed in our cohort the presence the L265 mutations, previously described using PCR-based assays. For the first time in VRL, we also identified the MYD88 S243N mutation. We also identified two-copy copy number losses in the tumor suppressor CDKN2A in all four cases, and one copy loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN in one sample. In one case, in which vitreous biopsies were originally read as cytologically negative, but which was confirmed as lymphoma when a lesion appeared in the brain two years later, our NGS-based approach detected tumoral DNA in the banked, original liquid biopsy.; CONCLUSIONS: We performed the first systematic exploration of the actionable cancer genome in VRL. Our NGS-based approach identified exploitable genomic alterations such as gain-of-function MYD88 oncogene mutations and loss of the tumor suppressor CDKN2A, and thus illuminates new routes to biologically targeted therapies for VRL, a cancer with a dismal prognosis. This precision medicine strategy could be used to nominate novel, targeted therapies in lymphomas and other blinding and deadly ocular, orbital, and ocular adnexal diseases for which few treatments exist.

AB Synchronous multifocal tumors often pose a diagnostic challenge for oncologists. The purpose of this study was to determine the clonal origin and metastatic relationship of synchronous multifocal tumors in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system using multi-omic platforms. DNA samples were extracted from three masses harvested from a 50-year-old Han Chinese male patient who suffered from synchronous multifocal tumors in the pancreatic tail, upper biliary duct, and omentum at the time of diagnosis. The clonal origin of these samples was tested using two platforms: next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 390 key genes harboring cancer-relevant actionable mutations and whole-genome copy number variation (CNV) chip analysis. The NGS approach revealed high mutational concordance, and the gene CNV profiles were similar between lesions. Whole-genome CNVs for the three samples were further investigated using an Affymetrix chip. Using matched CNV chip data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we developed a computational model that generated tissue-specific CNV signatures for hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma to accurately identify the origin of the tumor samples. After adding the patient's CNV chip data to the model, all three samples were clustered into the pancreatic cancer branch. Both our NGS and CNV chip analyses suggested that clinically diagnosed synchronous pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma originated from the same cell population in the pancreas in our patient. This study highlights the use of genomic tools to infer the origin of synchronous multifocal tumors, which could help to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis.

AB PURPOSE: Gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare cancer with no clinical standard treatment. With the rapid development of next generation sequencing, it has been able to provide reasonable treatment options for patients based on genetic variations. However, most cancer drugs are not approval for gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma indications. The correlation between drug response and a genetic variation needs to be further elucidated.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three patient-derived cells-JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002, and JXQ-3D-003, were derived from biopsy samples of one gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma patient with progression and have been characterized. In order to study the relationship between drug sensitivity and gene alteration, genetic mutations of three patient-derived cells were discovered by whole exome sequencing, and drug screening has been performed based on the gene alterations and related signaling pathways that are associated with drug targets.; RESULTS: It has been found that there are differences in biological characteristics such as morphology, cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation activity among these three patient-derived cells although they are derived from the same patient. Their sensitivities to the chemotherapy drugs-Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin are distinct. Moreover, none of common chemotherapy drugs could inhibit the proliferations of all three patient-derived cells. Comprehensive analysis of their whole exome sequencing demonstrated that tumor-associated genes TP53, AKT2, FGFR3, FGF10, SDHA, and PI3KCA were mutated or amplified. Part of these alterations are actionable. By screening a set of compounds that are associated with the genetic alteration, it has been found that GDC-0941 and PF-04691502 for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors could dramatically decrease the proliferation of three patient-derived cells. Importantly, expression of phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated S6 were markedly decreased after treatments with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors GDC-0941 (0.5 muM) and PF-04691502 (0.1 muM) in all three patient-derived cells. These data suggested that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that was activated by PIK3CA amplification in all three patient-derived cells could reduce the cell proliferation.; CONCLUSIONS: A patient-derived cell model combined with whole exome sequencing is a powerful tool to elucidate relationship between drug sensitivities and genetic alternations. In these gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma patient-derived cells, it is found that PIK3CA amplification could be used as a biomarker to indicate PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation. Block of the pathway may benefit the gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma patient with this alternation in hypothesis. The real efficacy needs to be confirmed in vivo or in a clinical trial.

AB PURPOSE: The clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in breast cancer has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that we could perform NGS of a new biopsy from patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in a clinically actionable timeframe.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We planned to enroll 40 patients onto a prospective study, Individualized Molecular Analyses Guide Efforts (IMAGE), to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining a new biopsy of a metastatic site, perform NGS (FoundationOne), and convene a molecular tumor board to formulate treatment recommendations within 28 days. We collected blood at baseline and at time of restaging to assess cell-free circulating plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA).; RESULTS: We enrolled 26 women with metastatic TNBC who had received ≥1 line of prior chemotherapy, and 20 (77%) underwent NGS of a metastatic site biopsy. Twelve (60%) evaluable patients received treatment recommendations within 28 days of consent. The study closed after 20 patients underwent NGS, based on protocol-specified interim futility analysis. Three patients went on to receive genomically directed therapies. Twenty-four of 26 patients had genetic alterations successfully detected in ptDNA. Among 5 patients, 4 mutations found in tumor tissues were not identified in blood, and 4 mutations found in blood were not found in corresponding tumors. In 9 patients, NGS of follow-up blood samples showed 100% concordance with baseline blood samples.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates challenges of performing NGS on prospective tissue biopsies in patients with metastatic TNBC within 28 days, while also highlighting the potential use of blood as a more time-efficient and less invasive method of mutational assessment.

AB Until recently, the molecular diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) was mostly based on BRCA1/2 testing. Next generation sequencing and the recent discovery of new genes involved in HBOC now permit the transfer of genomic capture targeting multiple candidate genes from research to clinical use. However, the implications for the management of patients and their families have not been extensively studied, in particular since some of these genes are not well-established cancer predisposing genes. We studied 583 consecutive patients from Burgundy (France) fulfilling the criteria for BRCA testing using a next generation sequencing 25-genes panel including 20 well-established high-risk cancer genes as well as more recently identified predisposing HBOC cancer. A pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation was found in 51 patients (9%). Besides, we found 37 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in 10 different high to low-risk genes in 34 patients (6%). The most frequently mutated genes were CHEK2 (n = 12; 2%), ATM (n = 9; 1.5%), and PALB2 (n = 4; 0.6%). Three patients had a mutation in two different predisposing genes. The analysis of clinical actionability conducted in mutation-positive individuals revealed that additional disease-specific screening and/or prevention measures beyond those based on personal and family history alone had been recommended in 69% of cases. In conclusion, multigene panel testing is a powerful tool to identifying high to low-risk HBOC susceptibility genes. The penetrance and spectrum of cancers with these other genes are sometimes undefined, and further collaborative work is crucial to address this question.

AB We investigated the patients with solid cancers harboring Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) amplification using targeted sequencing of tumor tissue specimen and FISH assay. Simultaneously, FLT3-amplified patient-derived cells (PDCs) were generated to evaluate the sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition. A patient with metastatic colon cancer who was previously treated with more than 3rd line cytotoxic chemotherapy was found to have FLT3 amplification and then received regorafenib showing partial response. In two PDC cell lines with FLT3 amplification, FLT3 mRNA expression was increased, however, the growth of tumor cells was not significantly inhibited by either regorafenib or sorafenib which is known to block the activity FLT3. Additional drug combinations with mTOR inhibitor did not affect the cell proliferation of PDC. FLT3 amplification in solid cancers is infrequently observed using targeted genomic profile, as yet, FLT3 amplification does not seem to be an actionable target or a proper biomarker for FLT3 inhibitor sensitivity.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Due to the high incidence of post-operative recurrence after current treatments, the identification of new and more effective drugs is required. In previous years, new targetable genes/pathways involved in HCC pathogenesis have been discovered through the help of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Mutations in TP53 and beta-catenin genes are the most frequent aberrations in HCC. However, approaches able to reverse the effect of these mutations might be unpredictable. In fact, if the reactivation of proteins, such as p53 in tumours, holds great promise as anticancer therapy, there are studies arguing that chronic activation of these types of molecules may be deleterious. Thus, recently the efforts on potential targets have focused on actionable mutations, such as those occurring in the gene encoding for focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This tyrosine kinase, localized to cellular focal contacts, is over-expressed in a variety of human tumours, including HCC. Moreover, several lines of evidence demonstrated that FAK depletion or inhibition impair in vitro and in vivo HCC growth and metastasis. Here, we provide an overview of FAK expression and activity in the context of tumour biology, discussing the current evidence of its connection with HCC development and progression.

AB This review focuses on three areas of interest with respect to the treatment of stage II and III colon and rectal cancer, including (1) tailoring adjuvant therapy for the geriatric population, (2) the controversy as to the optimal adjuvant therapy strategy for patients with locoregional rectal cancer and for patients with colorectal resectable metastatic disease, and (3) discussion of the microenvironment, molecular profiling, and the future of adjuvant therapy. It has become evident that age is the strongest predictive factor for receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, duration of treatment, and risk of treatment-related toxicity. Although incorporating adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery would appear to be a reasonable strategy to improve survivorship as an extrapolation from stage III colon cancer adjuvant trials, attempts at defining the optimal rectal cancer population that would benefit from adjuvant therapy remain elusive. Similarly, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients after resection of metastatic colorectal cancer has not been clearly defined because of very limited data to provide guidance. An understanding of the biologic hallmarks and drivers of metastatic spread as well as the micrometastatic environment is expected to translate into therapeutic strategies tailored to select patients. The identification of actionable targets in mesenchymal tumors is of major interest.

AB PURPOSE: Precision oncology is hindered by the lack of decision support for determining the functional and therapeutic significance of genomic alterations in tumors and relevant clinically available options. To bridge this knowledge gap, we established a Precision Oncology Decision Support (PODS) team that provides annotations at the alteration-level and subsequently determined if clinical decision-making was influenced.; METHODS: Genomic alterations were annotated to determine actionability based on a variant's known or potential functional and/or therapeutic significance. The medical records of a subset of patients annotated in 2015 were manually reviewed to assess trial enrollment. A web-based survey was implemented to capture the reasons why genotype-matched therapies were not pursued.; RESULTS: PODS processed 1,669 requests for annotation of 4,084 alterations (2,254 unique) across 49 tumor types for 1,197 patients. 2,444 annotations for 669 patients included an actionable variant call: 32.5% actionable, 9.4% potentially, 29.7% unknown, 28.4% non-actionable. 66% of patients had at least one actionable/potentially actionable alteration. 20.6% (110/535) patients annotated enrolled on a genotype-matched trial. Trial enrolment was significantly higher for patients with actionable/potentially actionable alterations (92/333, 27.6%) than those with unknown (16/136, 11.8%) and non-actionable (2/66, 3%) alterations (p=0.00004). Actionable alterations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and ERBB2 most frequently led to enrollment on genotype-matched trials. Clinicians cited a variety of reasons why patients with actionable alterations did not enroll on trials.; CONCLUSION: Over half of alterations annotated were of unknown significance or non-actionable. Physicians were more likely to enroll a patient on a genotype-matched trial when an annotation supported actionability. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the impact of decision support on trial enrollment and oncologic outcomes.

AB There are considerable quality differences across private Medicare Advantage insurance plans, so it is important that beneficiaries make informed choices. During open enrollment for the 2013 coverage year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services sent letters to beneficiaries enrolled in low-quality Medicare Advantage plans (i.e., plans rated less than 3 stars for at least 3 consecutive years by Medicare) explaining the stars and encouraging them to reexamine their choices. To understand the effectiveness of these low-cost, behavioral "nudge" letters, we used a beneficiary-level national retrospective cohort and performed multivariate regression analysis of plan selection during the 2013 open enrollment period among those enrolled in plans rated less than 3 stars. Our analysis controls for beneficiary demographic characteristics, health and health care spending risks, the availability of alternative higher rated plan options in their local market, and historical disenrollment rates from the plans. We compared the behaviors of those beneficiaries who received the nudge letters with those who enrolled in similar poorly rated plans but did not receive such letters. We found that beneficiaries who received the nudge letter were almost twice as likely (28.0% [95% confidence interval = 27.7%, 28.2%] vs. 15.3% [95% confidence interval = 15.1%, 15.5%]) to switch to a higher rated plan compared with those who did not receive the letter. White beneficiaries, healthier beneficiaries, and those residing in areas with more high-performing plan choices were more likely to switch plans in response to the nudge. Our findings highlight both the importance and efficacy of providing timely and actionable information to beneficiaries about quality in the insurance marketplace to facilitate informed and value-based coverage decisions.

AB Objectives. There have been advances in the identification and understanding of molecular subsets of lung cancer, defined by specific oncogenic aberrations. A number of actionable genetic alterations have been identified, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. We aimed to establish the reasons why patients were not undergoing EGFR mutation testing at the time of histological diagnosis. Methods. The records of 70 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung managed through a single multidisciplinary team at a single institution were reviewed. Data were collected on method of tumour sample collection, whether this was sent for EGFR testing, and the result. Results. Seventy patients were identified. In 21/25 (84%) cases, cytological sampling was sufficient for EGFR mutation analysis, compared with 40/45 (89%) cases with histological sampling. EGFR mutation testing was not carried out in 22/70 (31.4%) patients. There was insufficient tumour sample for EGFR testing in 9/22 (40.9%) patients. Other reasons for not testing included poor patient fitness and problems in the diagnostic pathway. Conclusions. In this series, cytological tumour sampling was not the predominant reason why cancers failed to have EGFR mutation status established.

AB A triple-negative breast cancer patient had no hereditary BRCA1, BRCA2, or TP53 risk variants. After exhaustion of standard treatments, she underwent experimental treatments and whole-exome sequencing of tumor, blood, and a metastasis. Well-tolerated experimental bortezomib monotherapy was administered for a progression-free period of 11 mo. After progression, treatments were changed and the exome data were evaluated, expanded with RNA and exome sequencing of a late-stage metastasis. In the final stage, eribulin alone and in combination with anthracyclines were administered. While suffering from grade 3 adverse events, skin metastases progressed. She lived 51 mo after initial diagnosis.Toxicity from anthracyclines and cisplatin may have been due to associated germline variants CBR3 C4Y and V224M and GSTP1 I105V, respectively. Somatic mutations predicted or reported as pathogenic were detected in 38 genes in tumor tissues. All tumor samples harbored the heterozygous TP53 Y220C variant, known to destabilize p53 and down-regulate p53-mediated apoptosis. The success of bortezomib may be explained by the previously reported up-regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which is p53-independent. Phylogenetic analysis of blood, primary tumor, and two metastases inferred an ancestral tumor cell with 12 expressed tumor mutations from which all three tumors may have evolved.Although our first urgent analysis could only include 40 genes, postmortem analysis uncovered the aggressiveness and suggested experimental therapies including 16 actionable targets, partly validated by immunohistochemistry. Exome and transcriptome analyses yielded comprehensive therapy-relevant information and should be considered for patients at first diagnosis. © 2017 MeiSSner et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Development and implementation of effective, sustainable, and scalable interventions that advance equity could be propelled by innovative and inclusive partnerships. Readied catalytic frameworks that foster communication, collaboration, a shared vision, and transformative translational research across scientific and non-scientific divides are needed to foster rapid generation of novel solutions to address and ultimately eliminate disparities. To achieve this, we transformed and expanded a community-academic board into a translational science board with members from public, academic and private sectors. Rooted in team science, diverse board experts formed topic-specific "accelerators", tasked with collaborating to rapidly generate new ideas, questions, approaches, and projects comprising patients, advocates, clinicians, researchers, funders, public health and industry leaders. We began with four accelerators-digital health, big data, genomics and environmental health-and were rapidly able to respond to funding opportunities, transform new ideas into clinical and community programs, generate new, accessible, actionable data, and more efficiently and effectively conduct research. This innovative model has the power to maximize research quality and efficiency, improve patient care and engagement, optimize data democratization and dissemination among target populations, contribute to policy, and lead to systems changes needed to address the root causes of disparities.

AB Purpose: Microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair (MMR) status is increasingly important in the management of patients with cancer to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We determined MSI status from large-panel clinical targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data across various solid cancer types.; Methods: The MSI statuses of 12,288 advanced solid cancers consecutively sequenced with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets clinical NGS assay were inferred by using MSIsensor, a program that reports the percentage of unstable microsatellites as a score. Cutoff score determination and sensitivity/specificity were based on MSI polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and MMR immunohistochemistry.; Results: By using an MSIsensor score ≥ 10 to define MSI high (MSI-H), 83 (8%) of 996 colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 42 (16%) of 260 uterine endometrioid cancers (UECs) were MSI-H. Validation against MSI PCR and/or MMR immunohistochemistry performed for 138 (24 MSI-H, 114 microsatellite stable [MSS]) CRCs, and 40 (15 MSI-H, 25 MSS) UECs showed a concordance of 99.4%. MSIsensor also identified 68 MSI-H/MMR-deficient (MMR-D) non-CRC/UECs. Of 9,591 non-CRC/UEC tumors with MSS MSIsensor status, 456 (4.8%) had slightly elevated scores(≥3 and <10) of which 96.6% with available material were confirmed to be MSS by MSI PCR. MSI-H was also detected and confirmed in three non-CRC/UECs with low exonic mutation burden (< 20). MSIsensor correctly scored all 15 polymerase epsilon ultra-mutated cancers as negative for MSI.; Conclusion: MSI status can be reliably inferred by MSIsensor from large-panel targeted NGS data. Concurrent MSI testing by NGS is resource efficient, is potentially more sensitive for MMR-D than MSI PCR, and allows identification of MSI-H across various cancers not typically screened, as highlighted by the finding that 35% (68 of 193) of all MSI-H tumors were non-CRC/ UEC.

AB An increased intensity of inpatient treatment, hospital-based routines, and separation from the familiar home environment may collectively increase the burden of the pediatric cancer experience. This study explored children and adolescents' perceived sources of bother related to hospitalization using two questions: (1) What bothered you the most about the hospital or hospital environment? and (2) What do you think could improve the hospital or hospital environment? Fifty children and adolescents (mean age 12.6 years) responded to these questions during each shift of a 3-day/3-night data collection period. Responses were analyzed using content analysis and chi-square analyses. Themes related to sources of bother included (1) "nothing/don't know," (2) "treatment and its consequences," (3) "isolation and loneliness," (4) "imposed bother," (5) "negative environment," and (6) "staff behaviors." Themes related to improving the hospital environment included (1) "nothing/don't know," (2) "normalizing activities," (3) "quality of the hospital environment," (4) "decrease burden of cancer and its treatment," and (5) "patient care issues." Participants' responses to these questions provide a foundation for actionable change to alleviate the burden associated with hospitalization.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of protein-coding genes and represent potential biomarkers for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, information linking miRNAs with their messenger RNA (mRNA) target genes modulating white blood cell (WBC) count is lacking. Here, we analyzed miRNAs and gene expression data from pediatric patients with ALL to identify a signature of miRNAs involved in ALL and their mRNA target genes, molecular networks, and biological pathways modulating WBC. We discovered a signature of miRNAs differentially expressed in ALL and a signature of mRNA target genes distinguishing patients with high WBC from patients with low WBC. In addition, we identified molecular networks and biological pathways, among them PI3/AKT, JAK/STAT, IL-17, TGF-beta, apoptosis, IL-15, STAT3, IGF-1, FGF, mTOR, VEGF, NF-kB, and P53 signaling pathways, enriched for or targeted by miRNAs. The discovered miRNAs and their target genes and pathways represent potential clinically actionable biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite known benefits of patient-perceived collaborative goal setting, we have a limited ability to monitor this process in practice. We developed the Patient Measure of Collaborative Goal Setting (PM-CGS) to evaluate the use of collaborative goal setting from the patient's perspective.; RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A random sample of 400 patients aged 40 years or older, receiving diabetes care from the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System between 8/2012 and 8/2013, were mailed a survey containing potential PM-CGS items (n=44) as well as measures of patient demographics, perceived self-management competence, trust in their physician, and self-management behaviors. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate construct validity. External validity was evaluated via a structural equation model (SEM) that tested the association of the PM-CGS with self-management behaviors. The direct and two mediated (via trust and self-efficacy) pathways were tested.; RESULTS: A total of 259 patients responded to the survey (64% response rate), of which 192 were eligible for inclusion. Results from the factor analysis supported a 37-item measure of patient-perceived CGS spanning five domains: listen and learn; share ideas; caring relationship; measurable objective; and goal achievement support (chi=4366.13, p<0.001; RMSEA=0.08). Results from the SEM supported the external validity of the PM-CGS. The relationship between CGS and self-management was partially mediated by perceived competence (p<0.05). The direct effect between the PM-CGS and self-management was significant (p<0.001).; CONCLUSIONS: CGS can be validly measured by the 37-item PM-CGS. Use of the PM-CGS can help illustrate actionable deficits in goal-setting discussions.

AB AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the interest of adult inpatients and selected outpatients in engaging in a large, real-life, hospital-based, genomic medicine research project and in receiving clinically actionable incidental findings.; METHODS: Within the framework of the cross-sectional Institutional Biobank of Lausanne, Switzerland, a total of 25721 patients of the CHUV University Hospital were systematically invited to grant researchers access to their biomedical data and to donate blood for future analyses, including whole-genome sequencing. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify personal factors, including age, gender, religion, ethnicity, citizenship, education level and mode of admission, associated with willingness to participate in this genomic research project and with interest in receiving clinically actionable incidental findings.; RESULTS: The overall participation rate was 79% (20343/25721). Participation rate declined progressively with age, averaging 83%, 75%, 67% and 62% in patients aged <64 years (n = 13108), ≥64 years (n = 12613), ≥80 years (n = 4557) and ≥90 years (n = 1050), respectively. Factors associated with participation substantially differed between age strata. Patients less likely to participate included women (odds ratio 0.86, [95% confidence interval 0.79-0.95] and 0.78 [0.71-0.85] before and after age 64, respectively), non-Swiss (0.81 [0.74-0.90] and 0.58 [0.52-0.65]) and those admitted through the emergency ward (0.88 [0.79-0.98] and 0.66 [0.60-0.73]). Religion and marital status were associated with participation among patients aged <64 years. A total of 19 018 (93%) participants were willing to be re-contacted for incidental findings. A high education level was associated with higher participation rate, but not with higher willingness to receive incidental findings within the population who had agreed to participate.; CONCLUSION: A large proportion of adult patients, even among the elderly, are willing to actively participate and receive incidental findings in this systematic hospital-based precision and genomic medicine research program with broad consent.

AB Myxofibrosarcomas are morphologically heterogeneous soft tissue sarcomas lacking a specific immunohistochemical expression profile and recurrent genetic changes. The study was designed to gain further insights into the molecular landscape of myxofibrosarcomas by targeted re-sequencing of known cancer driver hotspot mutations and the analysis of genomewide somatic copy number alterations. A well-defined group of myxofibrosarcomas, including myxofibrosarcomas G1 (n=6), myxofibrosarcomas G3 (n=7), myxofibrosarcomas with morphologically heterogeneous and independently selectable G1 and G3 areas within a tumor (n=8), and myxofibrosarcomas G3 with subsequent tumor recurrence (n=1) or metastatic disease (n=3) were evaluated. Mutational analysis demonstrated mutations in TP53, PTEN, FGFR3, CDKN2A, and RB1. TP53 mutations were seen in 11 (44%) of patients and detected in myxofibrosarcomas G1, G3, with heterogeneous morphology and G3 with subsequent metastases in 1 patient (16%), 3 patients (42%), 2 patients (62.5%), and 3 patients (75%), respectively. Additional mutations were detected in 2patients, intratumoral mutational heterogeneity in 1patient. We observed a variety of copy number alterations typical for myxofibrosarcomas, with higher numbers in G3 compared with G1 myxofibrosarcomas. Cluster analysis revealed distinctive features especially in metastatic and recurrent disease. Focal alterations affected CDKN2A, CCND1, CCNE1, EGFR, EPHA3, EPHB1, FGFR1, JUN, NF1, RB1, RET, TP53, and additional novel amplifications in CCNE1, KIT, EGFR, RET, BRAF, NTRK2 were seen in G3 compared with the G1 tumor areas. The total number of focal events in G1 versus G3 tumors differed significantly (P=0.0014). TRIO and RICTOR co-amplification was seen in 8 (44%) G3 and 1 (10%) G1 myxofibrosarcomas and RICTOR amplification alone in 4 (40%) G1 myxofibrosarcomas. TRIO amplification was significantly (P=0.0218) higher in G3 myxofibrosarcomas indicating a late genetic event. These findings support the use of expanded molecular profiling in myxofibrosarcomas to detect drug-able targets to allow patients to participate in basket trials.

AB Purpose: Tumor genomic profiling for personalized oncology therapy is being widely applied in clinical practice even as it is being evaluated more formally in clinical trials. Given the complexities of genomic data and its application to clinical use, molecular tumor boards with diverse expertise can provide guidance to oncologists and patients seeking to implement personalized genetically targeted therapy in practice.; Methods: A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board reviewed tumor molecular profiling reports from consecutive referrals at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins over a 3-year period. The tumor board weighed evidence for actionability of genomic alterations identified by molecular profiling and provided recommendations including US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug therapy, clinical trials of matched targeted therapy, off-label use of such therapy, and additional tumor or germline genetic testing.; Results: One hundred fifty-five patients were reviewed. Actionable genomic alterations were identified in 132 patients (85%). Off-label therapies were recommended in 37 patients (24%). Eleven patients were treated off-label, and 13 patients were enrolled onto clinical trials of matched targeted therapies. Median progression-free survival of patients treated with matched therapies was 5 months (95% CI, 2.9 months to not reached), and the progression-free survival probability at 6 months was 43%(95% CI, 26% to 71%). Lack of locally available clinical trials was the major limitation on clinical actionability of tumor profiling reports.; Conclusion: The molecular tumor board recommended off-label targeted therapies for a quarter of all patients reviewed. Outcomes were heterogeneous, although 43% of patients receiving genomically matched therapy derived clinical benefit lasting at least 6 months. Until more data become available from precision oncology trials, molecular tumor boards can help guide appropriate use of tumor molecular testing to direct therapy.

AB Nivolumab is a treatment option for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) previously treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapy. Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) comprises 10-15% of RCC cases but non-clear cell subtypes were excluded from the immunotherapy trials. We report the case of a woman with recurrent metastatic PRCC who had an impressive therapeutic response to nivolumab with no significant adverse events. She had previously been treated with sunitinib and pazopanib with no response. She showed a remarkable clinical improvement after only the first 2 immunotherapy cycles and subsequent radiographic studies demonstrated a marked decrease in tumor burden. At present, she continues to show a durable benefit after 8months of treatment. Her tumor had <1% positivity for PD-L1 staining and a low tumor mutational burden with no actionable mutations on genomic sequencing. Considering its high genetic variation, checkpoint blockade immunotherapies (CBIs) are attractive treatment options in PRCC. This is the third case that reports objective responses of nivolumab in PRCC. We believe our patient's experience supports the inclusion of non-clear cell RCC on clinical trials using CBIs. PD-L1 status and TMB may not serve as predictive biomarkers for response.

AB Biological therapies have improved survival outcomes of advanced-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Genotype-directed therapies have changed treatment paradigms of patients with EGFR-mutant and ALK/ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas, and the list of druggable targets with demonstrated clinical actionability (BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK1 and HER2) continues to expand. Furthermore, we have incrementally understood the mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and foresee ways to effectively circumvent them, particularly at the immune checkpoint level. Drugs targeting the tumour immune-evasive PD-1 pathway have demonstrated remarkable treatment benefits in this disease, with a non-negligible fraction of patients potentially receiving long-term survival benefits. Herein, we briefly discuss the role of various medical disciplines in the management of advanced-stage NSCLC and review the most relevant biological therapies for this disease, with particular emphasis in genotype-directed therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

AB Background: Precision therapy for lung cancer will require comprehensive genomic testing to identify actionable targets as well as ascertain disease prognosis. RNA-seq is a robust platform that meets these requirements, but microarray-derived prognostic signatures are not optimal for RNA-seq data. Thus, we undertook the first prognostic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma RNA-seq data and generated a prognostic signature.; Methods: Lung adenocarcinoma RNA-seq and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were divided chronologically into training (n=255) and validation (n=157) cohorts. In the training cohort, prognostic association was assessed by univariate Cox analysis. A prognostic signature was built with stepwise multivariable Cox analysis. Outcomes by risk group, stage, and mutation status were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox analyses. All the statistical tests were two-sided.; Results: In the training cohort, 96 genes had prognostic association with P values of less than or equal to 1.00x10-4, including five long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Stepwise regression generated a four-gene signature, including one lncRNA. Signature high-risk cases had worse overall survival (OS) in the TCGA validation cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.00 to 14.62) and a University of Michigan institutional cohort (n=67; HR=2.05, 95% CI=1.18 to 4.55), and worse metastasis-free survival in the TCGA validation cohort (HR=3.05, 95% CI=2.31 to 13.37). The four-gene prognostic signature also statistically significantly stratified overall survival in important clinical subsets, including stage I (HR=2.78, 95% CI=1.91 to 11.13), EGFR wild-type (HR=3.01, 95% CI=1.73 to 14.98), and EGFR mutant (HR=8.99, 95% CI=62.23 to 141.44). The four-gene prognostic signature also stood out on top when compared with other prognostic signatures.; Conclusions: Here, we present the first RNA-seq prognostic signature for lung adenocarcinoma that can provide a powerful prognostic tool for precision oncology as part of an integrated RNA-seq clinical sequencing program. © The Author 2016.

AB As part of an enterprise-wide rollout of a new EHR, Intermountain Healthcare is investing significant effort in building a central library of best-practice order sets. As part of this effort, we have built analytics tools that can capture and determine actionable opportunities for change to order set templates, as reflected by aggregate user data. In order to determine the acceptability of this system and set meaningful thresholds for actual use, we extracted recommendations for additions, removals, and change in initial order selection status for a series of thirteen order sets. We asked local clinical experts to review the changes and classify them as acceptable or not. In total, the system identified 362 potential changes in the order set templates and 186 were deemed acceptable. While further enhancement will co sharpen the efficacy of the intervention, we expect that this type of utility will provide useful insight for content owners.

AB Healthcare quality research is a fundamental task that involves assessing treatment patterns and measuring the associated patient outcomes to identify potential areas for improving healthcare. While both qualitative and quantitative approaches are used, a major obstacle for the quantitative approach is that many useful healthcare quality indicators are buried within provider narrative notes, requiring expensive and laborious manual chart review to identify and measure them. Information extraction is a key Natural Language Processing (NLP) task for discovering and mining critical knowledge buried in unstructured clinical data. Nevertheless, widespread adoption of NLP has yet to materialize; the technical skills required for the development or use of such software present a major barrier for medical researchers wishing to employ these methods. In this paper we introduce Canary, a free and open source solution designed for users without NLP and technical expertise and apply it to four tasks, aiming to measure the frequency of: (1) insulin decline; (2) statin medication decline; (3) adverse reactions to statins; and (3) bariatric surgery counselling. Our results demonstrate that this approach facilitates mining of unstructured data with high accuracy, enabling the extraction of actionable healthcare quality insights from free-text data sources.

AB Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Obtaining patients' smoking status is the first step in delivering smoking cessation counseling. In this study, we assessed the quality of smoking status captured in an electronic health record from a large academic medical center. We analyzed data from structured notes, finding that smoking status was documented in 98% of 64,451 hospital encounters in 2016. 32% hospital encounters had discrepant documentation, and 54.5% of patients had implausible changes (e.g., changes from "current smoker" to "never smoker"). Overall, only 2.9% of patients were documented as active smokers, but 36.4% were documented as "unknown" or had discrepancies in their smoking status. These results suggest that patients that smoke are not appropriately identified. Centralized documentation with clinically actionable smoking status categories and implementation of patient-facing tools that allow patients to directly record their information could improve data quality of smoking status.

AB Unbiased genetic association studies, including genome-wide association and whole-genome sequencing studies, have uncovered many novel disease-associated variants. Relatively few of these associated regions, however, have led to insights that are biologically mechanistic or clinically actionable due in part to the difficulty in designing appropriate functional validation studies to understand how variants contribute to disease. Asthma is a complex inflammatory lung disease for which many genetic associations have been identified. Using asthma as a disease model, we designed Reducing Associations by Linking Genes And transcriptomic Results (REALGAR), an app that facilitates the design of functional validation studies by integrating cell- and tissue-specific results of diseaserelevant gene expression and other omics studies. Via specific examples, we demonstrate how integrated gene- centric and disease-specific information leads to asthma insights, and more broadly, can help understand complex diseases.

AB In theory, the logic of decision rules should be atomic. In practice, this is not always possible; initially simple logic statements tend to be overloaded with additional conditions restricting the scope of such rules. By doing so, the original logic soon becomes encumbered with contextual knowledge. Contextual knowledge is re-usable on its own and could be modeled separately from the logic of a rule without losing the intended functionality. We model constraints to explicitly define the context where knowledge of decision rules is actionable. We borrowed concepts from Semantic Web, Complex Adaptive Systems, and Contextual Reasoning. The proposed approach provides the means for identifying and modeling contextual knowledge in a simple, sound manner. The methodology presented herein facilitates rule authoring, fosters consistency in rules implementation and maintenance; facilitates developing authoritative knowledge repositories to promote quality, safety and efficacy of healthcare; and paves the road for future work in knowledge discovery.

AB Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are epidemic in the United States, and efforts to shift this trend have been largely ineffective. The greatest challenge that health care practitioners face is inspiring the lifestyle changes necessary to prevent or reverse these conditions. New evidence suggests that minimal activity, such as simply standing up periodically and moving around can reduce biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Given the challenge and temporary nature of inspiring habitually sedentary individuals to take on intensive exercise routines, this is an exciting prospect. With this new information, the question becomes: "How do we inspire individuals and populations to get up and move?" Dr. Matthew Buman and his group at Arizona State University are addressing this question through researching methods to inspire individuals and groups to stand at move at work. In support of Dr. Buman's work, we have leveraged subject generated postural data gathered by his group to create a pipeline that processes and analyzes the patterns of subject movement with the prompts they received in order to identify the most effective prompt that elicits standing and moving behavior. The pipeline helps researchers in his group visualize their data in an interactive way and to help inform statistical analyses. In future directions, this pipeline structure can be adopted by various aspects of clinical work such as diagnosis, selection of treatment options, monitoring for changes in a patient's conditions over time, evaluating efficacy of different treatment options, and promoting shared decision-making between providers and patients. They can range from novel ways to visualize PGD to help clinicians and patients identify important and actionable trends, to novel computational solutions, to using these data together with the traditional EHR data to provide clinical decision support that may or may not include visual presentations. Importantly, in this challenge, our focus is on integrating PGD with EHR to improve care within the clinical context, rather than on using these data outside of traditional care settings to promote health and wellness.

AB The cancer genome provides the blueprint for identifying oncogenic mutations driving tumor growth and these mutant proteins and pathways are the targets for precision cancer therapies. However, many oncogenes are capable of reprogramming the landscape of active portion of the genome, commonly known as the epigenome. This creates fluidity, and thereby heterogeneity, that demands consideration of this additional layer of complexity for effective therapeutic design and application. Molecular dissection of the epigenome may identify oncogene-induced, actionable vulnerabilities, broadening the spectrum of precision oncology treatments.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: The genomic landscape of metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) reveals that up to 90% of patients harbor actionable mutations and >20% have somatic DNA repair gene defects (DRD). This provides the therapeutic rationale of PARP inhibition (PARPi) to achieve "synthetic lethality" in treating this fatal disease. Clinical trials with PARP inhibitors have shown significant response rates up to 88% for PCa patients having DRD like BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations. The FDA has awarded "breakthrough designation" to develop the PARPi olaparib in treating this subset of metastatic PCa patients. The search for predictive biomarkers has expanded the realm of DNA repair genetic defects and combination genetic platforms are being evaluated as tools to assess potential "BRCAness" of tumors. Ongoing clinical trials seek to determine the optimal timing and sequence of using these agents in current PCa treatment algorithms. Combination strategies of PARPi with chemo-, radiation, and hormonal therapies, targeted agents, and immunotherapy are promising avenues of current research. Multi-center international collaborations in well-designed biomarker-driven clinical trials will be key to harness the potential of PARPi in managing a heterogeneous disease like prostate cancer.

AB A key ingredient to successful health promotion is a primary care provider who can offer an informed first response to lifestyle issues, emerging problems and chronic challenges. This article aims to assist family physicians to play their role in promoting the health of people with SCI, by summarizing the latest evidence in the management of spinal cord injury in primary care. This study used a scoping review methodology to survey peer-reviewed journal articles and clinical guidelines published between January 2012 to June 2016. This search strategy identified 153 articles across 20 topics. A prevention framework is used to identify five primary, nine secondary, four tertiary, and two quaternary prevention issues about which family physicians require current information. Major changes in the management of SCI in primary care were noted for 8 of the 20 topics, specifically in the areas of pharmacological management of neuropathic pain and urinary tract infection; screening for bowel and bladder cancer; improvements in wound care; and clarification of dietary fibre recommendations. All of these changes are represented in the 3rd edition of Actionable Nuggets-an innovative tool to assist family physicians to be aware of the best practices in primary care for spinal cord injury.

AB Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is widely used in the acute care setting for acute respiratory failure (ARF) across a variety of aetiologies. This document provides European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society recommendations for the clinical application of NIV based on the most current literature.The guideline committee was composed of clinicians, methodologists and experts in the field of NIV.The committee developed recommendations based on the GRADE (Grading, Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology for each actionable question. The GRADE Evidence to Decision framework in the guideline development tool was used to generate recommendations. A number of topics were addressed using technical summaries without recommendations and these are discussed in the supplementary material.This guideline committee developed recommendations for 11 actionable questions in a PICO (population-intervention-comparison-outcome) format, all addressing the use of NIV for various aetiologies of ARF. The specific conditions where recommendations were made include exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, de novo hypoxaemic respiratory failure, immunocompromised patients, chest trauma, palliation, post-operative care, weaning and post-extubation.This document summarises the current state of knowledge regarding the role of NIV in ARF. Evidence-based recommendations provide guidance to relevant stakeholders. Copyright ©ERS 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with rare diseases face health disparities and are often challenged to find accurate information about their condition. We aimed to use the best available evidence and community partnerships to produce patient education materials for congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and the olfacto-genital (Kallmann) syndrome (i.e., CHH and defective sense of smell), and to evaluate end-user acceptability. Expert clinicians, researchers and patients co-created the materials in a multi-step process. Six validated algorithms were used to assess reading level of the final product. Comprehensibility and actionability were measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool via web-based data collection. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize data and thematic analysis for analyzing open-ended responses. Subsequently, translation and cultural adaption were conducted by clinicians and patients who are native speakers.; RESULTS: Co-created patient education materials reached the target 6th grade reading level according to 2/6 (33%) algorithms (range: grade 5.9-9.7). The online survey received 164 hits in 2months and 63/159 (40%) of eligible patients completed the evaluation. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 66years (median 36, mean 39±11) and 52/63 (83%), had adequate health literacy. Patients scored understandability at 94.2% and actionability at 90.5%. The patient education materials were culturally adapted and translated into 20 languages (available in Additional file 1).; CONCLUSIONS: Partnering with patients enabled us to create patient education materials that met patient- identified needs as evidenced by high end-user acceptability, understandability and actionability. The web-based evaluation was effective for reaching dispersed rare disease patients. Combining dissemination via traditional healthcare professional platforms as well as patient-centric sites can facilitate broad uptake of culturally adapted translations. This process may serve as a roadmap for creating patient education materials for other rare diseases.

AB The rapid rise in technologies for data collection has created an unmatched opportunity to advance the use of data-rich tools for lifecycle decision-making. However, the usefulness of these technologies is limited by the ability to translate lifecycle data into actionable insights for human decision-makers. This is especially true in the case of sustainable lifecycle design (SLD), as the assessment of environmental impacts, and the feasibility of making corresponding design changes, often relies on human expertise and intuition. Supporting human sense-making in SLD requires the use of both data-driven and user-driven methods while exploring lifecycle data. A promising approach for combining the two is through the use of visual analytics (VA) tools. Such tools can leverage the ability of computer-based tools to gather, process, and summarize data along with the ability of human-experts to guide analyses through domain knowledge or data-driven insight. In this paper, we review previous research that has created VA tools in SLD. We also highlight existing challenges and future opportunities for such tools in different lifecycle stages-design, manufacturing, distribution & supply chain, use-phase, end-of-life, as well as life cycle assessment. Our review shows that while the number of VA tools in SLD is relatively small, researchers are increasingly focusing on the subject matter. Our review also suggests that VA tools can address existing challenges in SLD and that significant future opportunities exist.

AB Background: Adolescent and young adult years are critical to the development of behaviors that influence health across the life course. To reveal which health communication channels should be used to effectively reach and influence younger populations in Senegal, we used a mixed methods approach to identify and interpret the multifaceted influences surrounding where and why this population accesses health information.; Methods: We conducted 16 focus group discussions among adolescents and young adults in Senegal in September 2012. We then collected survey data from a larger, more diverse sample of Senegalese youth in October-November 2014.; Results: Our results demonstrate that information sources vary by health topic, differential access, age, and other demographics. While there is a greater perception of credibility and usefulness in information received from health professionals, stigma remains a barrier for obtaining information about HIV/AIDS from health centers. Older youth are also less likely to seek health information from adults, which may be influenced by preferred use of information technologies, especially for information about taboo health topics.; Conclusions: Our findings support multi-pronged, targeted approaches to health communication efforts. We recommend that doctors continue to provide actionable information about preventing or treating specific diseases, whereas teachers should educate youth about general health topics and health promotion behaviors. The results suggest that traditional mass media, such as radio and television, are the best communication channels for information about HIV and sexual/reproductive health, especially for older adolescents and young adults.

AB Background: Hearing loss is defined as worsening of hearing acuity and is usually expressed as an increase in the hearing threshold. Tinnitus, defined as "ringing in the ear", is a common and often disturbing accompaniment of hearing loss. Hearing loss and environmental exposures to noise are increasingly recognized health problems. Objectives: The objective was to assess whether the exposure-response relationship can be established between exposures to non-occupational noise and permanent hearing outcomes such as permanent hearing loss and tinnitus. Methods: Information sources: Computer searches of all accessible medical and other databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) were performed and complemented with manual searches. The search was not limited to a particular time span, except for the effects of personal listening devices (PLDs). The latter was limited to the years 2008-June 2015, since previous knowledge was summarized by SCENIHR descriptive systematic review published in 2008. Study eligibility criteria: The inclusion criteria were as follows: the exposure to noise was measured in sound pressure levels (SPLs) and expressed in individual equivalent decibel values (LEX,8h), the studies included both exposed and reference groups, the outcome was a permanent health effect, i.e., permanent hearing loss assessed with pure-tone audiometry and/or permanent tinnitus assessed with a questionnaire. The eligibility criteria were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: The risk of bias was assessed for all of the papers using a template for assessment of quality and the risk of bias. The GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence. Meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological heterogeneity of included studies and the inadequacy of data. Results: Out of 220 references identified, five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All of them were related to the use of PLDs and comprised in total of 1551 teenagers and young adults. Three studies used hearing loss as the outcome and three tinnitus. There was a positive correlation between noise level and hearing loss either at standard or extended high frequencies in all three of the studies on hearing loss. In one study, there was also a positive correlation between the duration of PLD use and hearing loss. There was no association between prolonged listening to loud music through PLDs and tinnitus or the results were contradictory. All of the evidence was of low quality. Limitations: The studies are cross-sectional. No study provides odds ratios of hearing loss by the level of exposure to noise. Conclusions: While using very strict inclusion criteria, there is low quality GRADE evidence that prolonged listening to loud music through PLDs increases the risk of hearing loss and results in worsening standard frequency audiometric thresholds. However, specific threshold analyses focused on stratifying risk according to clearly defined levels of exposure are missing. Future studies are needed to provide actionable guidance for PLDs users. No studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria related to other isolated or combined exposures to environmental noise were identified.

AB High-quality, simplified, and low-cost human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance tests that are able to provide timely actionable HIV resistance data at individual, population, and programmatic levels are needed to confront the emerging drug-resistant HIV epidemic. Next-generation sequencing technologies embedded in automated cloud-computing analysis environments are ideally suited for such endeavor. Whereas NGS can reduce costs over Sanger sequencing, automated analysis pipelines make NGS accessible to molecular laboratories regardless of the available bioinformatic skills. They can also produce highly structured, high-quality data that could be examined by healthcare officials and program managers on a real-time basis to allow timely public health action. Here we discuss the opportunities and challenges of such an approach. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

AB Although agents that inhibit specific oncogenic kinases have been successful in a subset of cancers, there are currently few treatment options for malignancies that lack a targetable oncogenic driver. Nevertheless, during tumor evolution cancers engage a variety of protective pathways, which may provide alternative actionable dependencies. Here, we identify a promising combination therapy that kills NF1-mutant tumors by triggering catastrophic oxidative stress. Specifically, we show that mTOR and HDAC inhibitors kill aggressive nervous system malignancies and shrink tumors in vivo by converging on the TXNIP/thioredoxin antioxidant pathway, through cooperative effects on chromatin and transcription. Accordingly, TXNIP triggers cell death by inhibiting thioredoxin and activating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, this drug combination also kills NF1-mutant and KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancers. Together, these studies identify a promising therapeutic combination for several currently untreatable malignancies and reveal a protective nodal point of convergence between these important epigenetic and oncogenic enzymes.Significance: There are no effective therapies for NF1- or RAS-mutant cancers. We show that combined mTOR/HDAC inhibitors kill these RAS-driven tumors by causing catastrophic oxidative stress. This study identifies a promising therapeutic combination and demonstrates that selective enhancement of oxidative stress may be more broadly exploited for developing cancer therapies.

AB With biodiversity research activities being increasingly shifted to the web, the need for a system of persistent and stable identifiers for physical collection objects becomes increasingly pressing. The Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities agreed on a common system of HTTP-URI-based stable identifiers which is now rolled out to its member organizations. The system follows Linked Open Data principles and implements redirection mechanisms to human-readable and machine-readable representations of specimens facilitating seamless integration into the growing semantic web. The implementation of stable identifiers across collection organizations is supported with open source provider software scripts, best practices documentations and recommendations for RDF metadata elements facilitating harmonized access to collection information in web portals.; Database URL: : http://cetaf.org/cetaf-stable-identifiers. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a multi-gene panel is now available for patients with lung adenocarcinoma, but the performance characteristics and clinical utility of this testing are not well-described. We present the results of an extended 467 gene panel in a series of advanced, highly selected nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using a range of specimens, including predominantly small biopsy and cytology specimens.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 22 NSCLC biopsies sent for NGS using an extended gene panel from January 2014 to July 2015. The customized NGS panel sequences 467 cancer-associated genes with exonic and intronic sequences obtained from purified tumor DNA. Genomic alterations, patient characteristics, and success of testing were determined.; RESULTS: The majority of samples tested were metastatic lung adenocarcinoma on final pathology. Of the 22 specimens tested, 5 (22.7%) were surgical resections and 17 (77.3%) were small biopsy and cytology specimens. Twenty-one (95%) of the specimens were adequate for full sequencing and yielded a total of 204 genomic alterations (average 8.9 per tumor), of which 17 (average 0.81 per tumor) were actionable and/or clinically relevant. Genomic alterations were found most commonly in the TP53, EGFR, EPHB1, MLL3, APC, SETD2, KRAS, DNMT3A, RB1, CDKN2A, ARID1A, EP300, KDM6B, RAD50, STK11, and BRCA2 genes.; CONCLUSIONS: NGS using a comprehensive gene panel was performed successfully in 95% of all NSCLC cases in this series, including 94% small biopsy and cytology specimens and 100% surgical resections. This custom assay was performed on a range of tumor specimens and demonstrates that small specimens are able to provide a similar depth of information as larger ones. As many patients present at an advanced stage and only small specimens are obtained, the information these provide has the potential for guiding treatment in highly selected patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.

AB The massive molecular profiling of thousands of cancer patients has led to the identification of many tumor type specific driver genes. However, only a few (or none) of them are present in each individual tumor and, to enable precision oncology, we need to interpret the alterations found in a single patient. Cancer PanorOmics (http://panoromics.irbbarcelona.org) is a web-based resource to contextualize genomic variations detected in a personal cancer genome within the body of clinical and scientific evidence available for 26 tumor types, offering complementary cohort- and patient-centric views. Additionally, it explores the cellular environment of mutations by mapping them on the human interactome and providing quasi-atomic structural details, whenever available. This 'PanorOmic' molecular view of individual tumors, together with the appropriate genetic counselling and medical advice, should contribute to the identification of actionable alterations ultimately guiding the clinical decision-making process. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB Feedback, especially timely, specific, and actionable feedback, frequently does not occur. Efforts to better understand methods to improve the effectiveness of feedback are an important area of educational research. This study represents preliminary work as part of a plan to investigate the perceptions of a student-driven system to request feedback from faculty using a mobile device and Web-based application. We hypothesize that medical students will perceive learner-initiated, timely feedback to be an essential component of clinical education. Furthermore, we predict that students will recognize the use of a mobile device and Web application to be an advantageous and effective method when requesting feedback from supervising physicians. Focus group data from 18 students enrolled in a 4-week anesthesia clerkship revealed the following themes: (1) students often have to solicit feedback, (2) timely feedback is perceived as being advantageous, (3) feedback from faculty is perceived to be more effective, (4) requesting feedback from faculty physicians poses challenges, (5) the decision to request feedback may be influenced by the student's clinical performance, and (6) using a mobile device and Web application may not guarantee timely feedback. Students perceived using a mobile Web-based application to initiate feedback from supervising physicians to be a valuable method of assessment. However, challenges and barriers were identified.

AB Pediatric T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients often display resistance to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. These patients, classified as prednisone poor responders (PPR), have poorer outcome than do the other pediatric T-ALL patients receiving a high-risk adapted therapy. Because glucocorticoids are administered to ALL patients during all the different phases of therapy, GC resistance represents an important challenge to improving the outcome for these patients. Mechanisms underlying resistance are not yet fully unraveled; thus our research focused on the identification of deregulated signaling pathways to point out new targeted approaches. We first identified, by reverse-phase protein arrays, the lymphocyte cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK) as aberrantly activated in PPR patients. We showed that LCK inhibitors, such as dasatinib, bosutinib, nintedanib, and WH-4-023, are able to induce cell death in GC-resistant T-ALL cells, and remarkably, cotreatment with dexamethasone is able to reverse GC resistance, even at therapeutic drug concentrations. This was confirmed by specific LCK gene silencing and ex vivo combined treatment of cells from PPR patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, we observed that LCK hyperactivation in PPR patients upregulates the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling triggering to interleukin-4 (IL-4) overexpression. GC-sensitive cells cultured with IL-4 display an increased resistance to dexamethasone, whereas the inhibition of IL-4 signaling could increase GC-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. Treatment with dexamethasone and dasatinib also impaired engraftment of leukemia cells in vivo. Our results suggest a quickly actionable approach to supporting conventional therapies and overcoming GC resistance in pediatric T-ALL patients. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB Reports of neglected and underutilized crops' (NUS) potential remain mostly anecdotal with limited and often incoherent research available to support them. This has been attributed to lack of clear research goals, limited funding directed at NUS and journal apathy toward publishing work on NUS. The latter points also explain the lack of interest from emerging and established researchers. Additionally, the NUS community's inability to articulate a roadmap for NUS' promotion may have unintentionally contributed to this. The current study is a sequel to an initial study that assessed the status of NUS in South Africa. The objective of this follow-up study was then to (i) identify priority NUS, and (ii) articulate a strategy and actionable recommendations for promoting NUS in South Africa. The study identified 13 priority NUS, categorized into cereals, legumes, root, and tuber crops and leafy vegetables based on drought and heat stress tolerance and nutritional value. It is recommended that the available limited resources should be targeted on improving these priority NUS as they offer the best prospects for success. Focus should be on developing value chains for the priority NUS. This should be underpinned by science to provide evidence-based outcomes. This would assist to attract more funding for NUS research, development and innovation in South Africa. It is envisaged that through this roadmap, NUS could be transformed from the peripheries into mainstream agriculture. This study provides a template for developing a roadmap for promoting NUS that could be transposed and replicated among the 14 other southern African states.

AB Nutrigenetic research examines the effects of inter-individual differences in genotype on responses to nutrients and other food components, in the context of health and of nutrient requirements. A practical application of nutrigenetics is the use of personal genetic information to guide recommendations for dietary choices that are more efficacious at the individual or genetic subgroup level relative to generic dietary advice. Nutrigenetics is unregulated, with no defined standards, beyond some commercially adopted codes of practice. Only a few official nutrition-related professional bodies have embraced the subject, and, consequently, there is a lack of educational resources or guidance for implementation of the outcomes of nutrigenetic research. To avoid misuse and to protect the public, personalised nutrigenetic advice and information should be based on clear evidence of validity grounded in a careful and defensible interpretation of outcomes from nutrigenetic research studies. Evidence requirements are clearly stated and assessed within the context of state-of-the-art 'evidence-based nutrition'. We have developed and present here a draft framework that can be used to assess the strength of the evidence for scientific validity of nutrigenetic knowledge and whether 'actionable'. In addition, we propose that this framework be used as the basis for developing transparent and scientifically sound advice to the public based on nutrigenetic tests. We feel that although this area is still in its infancy, minimal guidelines are required. Though these guidelines are based on semi-quantitative data, they should stimulate debate on their utility. This framework will be revised biennially, as knowledge on the subject increases.

Sixty-seven variants in 19 genes with known effects on drug response were compared between genome sequencing and targeted genotyping data for coverage and concordance in 98 pediatric patients. We used targeted genotyping data as a benchmark to assess accuracy of variant calling, and to identify copy number variations of the CYP2D6 gene. We then predicted clinical impact of these variants on drug therapy. We find genotype concordance across those panels to be >97%. Concordance of CYP2D6 predicted phenotype between estimates of whole-genome sequencing and targeted genotyping panel were 90%; a result from a lower coverage depth or variant calling difficulties in our whole-genome sequencing data when copy number variation and/or the CYP2D6*4 haplotype were present. Importantly, 95 children had at least one clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variant. Diagnostic genomic sequencing data can be used for pre-emptive pharmacogenetic screening. However, concordance between genome-wide sequencing and target genotyping needs to be characterized for each of the pharmacologically important genes.

AB The lack of awareness and confidence in eHealth solutions among certain stakeholders creates a barrier for the implementation of e-Health services. The aim of this paper is to explore issues that promote the development and implementation of patient-centered care services for the elderly. An exploratory case study approach is applied to a e-Health monitoring service that was developed and piloted in 38 homes for the elderly in Sweden and the Netherlands. The unit of analysis, concept of 'value-in-use', was used in order to determine how pilot participants felt about a service of this kind benefiting them the most. The findings were then translated into actionable considerations for implementing organizations. The results indicate a need for active participation, technical support infrastructure, mobility demands, and an extension of the concept of trust in e-Health services. The knowledge presented in the study is important for decisions makers, public organization strategists, and policy writers.

AB Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are aggressive neoplasms representing approximately 20% of brain tumors in children. Current therapies offer limited disease control, and patients have a poor prognosis. Empiric use of targeted therapy, especially at progression, is increasingly practiced despite a paucity of data regarding temporal and therapy-driven genomic evolution in pHGGs. To study the genetic landscape of pHGGs at recurrence, we performed whole exome and methylation analyses on matched primary and recurrent pHGGs from 16 patients. Tumor mutational profiles identified three distinct subgroups. Group 1 (n=7) harbored known hotspot mutations in Histone 3 (H3) (K27M or G34V) or IDH1 (H3/IDH1 mutants) and co-occurring TP53 or ACVR1 mutations in tumor pairs across the disease course. Group 2 (n=7), H3/IDH1 wildtype tumor pairs, harbored novel mutations in chromatin modifiers (ZMYND11, EP300 n=2), all associated with TP53 alterations, or had BRAF V600E mutations (n=2) conserved across tumor pairs. Group 3 included 2 tumors with NF1 germline mutations. Pairs from primary and relapsed pHGG samples clustered within the same DNA methylation subgroup. ATRX mutations were clonal and retained in H3G34V and H3/IDH1 wildtype tumors, while different genetic alterations in this gene were observed at diagnosis and recurrence in IDH1 mutant tumors. Mutations in putative drug targets (EGFR, ERBB2, PDGFRA, PI3K) were not always shared between primary and recurrence samples, indicating evolution during progression. Our findings indicate that specific key driver mutations in pHGGs are conserved at recurrence and are prime targets for therapeutic development and clinical trials (e.g. H3 post-translational modifications, IDH1, BRAF V600E). Other actionable mutations are acquired or lost, indicating that re-biopsy at recurrence will provide better guidance for effective targeted therapy of pHGGs.

AB Personalised Medicine has become a reality over the last years. The emergence of 'omics' and big data has started revolutionizing healthcare. New 'omics' technologies lead to a better molecular characterization of diseases and a new understanding of the complexity of diseases. The approach of PM is already successfully applied in different healthcare areas such as oncology, cardiology, nutrition and for rare diseases. However, health systems across the EU are often still promoting the 'one-size fits all' approach, even if it is known that patients do greatly vary in their molecular characteristics and response to drugs and other interventions. To make use of the full potentials of PM in the next years ahead several challenges need to be addressed such as the integration of big data, patient empowerment, translation of basic to clinical research, bringing the innovation to the market and shaping sustainable healthcare systems.

AB In today's aging society, more people are living with lifestyle-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Numerous opinion-leader organizations recommend lifestyle medicine as the first-line approach in NCD prevention and treatment. However, there is a strong need for a personalized approach as "one-size-fits-all" public health recommendations have been insufficient in addressing the interindividual differences in the diverse populations. Advancement in systems biology and the "omics" technologies has allowed comprehensive analysis of how complex biological systems are impacted upon external perturbations (e.g., nutrition and exercise), and therefore is gradually pushing personalized lifestyle medicine toward reality. Clinicians and healthcare practitioners have a unique opportunity in advocating lifestyle medicine because patients see them as a reliable source of advice. However, there are still numerous technical and logistic challenges to overcome before personal "big data" can be translated into actionable and clinically relevant solutions. Clinicians are also facing various issues prior to bringing personalized lifestyle medicine to their practice. Nevertheless, emerging ground-breaking research projects have given us a glimpse of how systems thinking and computational methods may lead to personalized health advice. It is important that all stakeholders work together to create the needed paradigm shift in healthcare before the rising epidemic of NCDs overwhelm the society, the economy, and the dated health system.

AB Precision oncology, defined as molecular profiling of tumors to identify targetable alterations, is rapidly developing and has entered the mainstream of clinical practice. Genomic testing involves many stakeholders working in a coordinated fashion to deliver high-quality tissue samples to high-quality laboratories, where appropriate next-generation sequencing (NGS) molecular analysis leads to actionable results. Clinicians should be familiar with the types of genomic variants reported by the laboratory and the technology used to determine the results, including limitations of current testing methodologies and reports. Interpretation of genomic results is best undertaken with multidisciplinary input to reduce uncertainty in clinical recommendations relating to a documented variant. Non-small cell lung cancer has emerged as a prototype disease where genomic data from at least several well-documented alterations with approved targeted agents are essential for optimal treatment from diagnosis of advanced disease. Due to the development of resistance to targeted therapies, resampling and retesting of tumors, including using liquid biopsy technology after clinical progression, may be important in making treatment decisions. The value of molecular profiling depends on avoiding both underutilization for well-documented variant target-drug pairs and overutilization of variant-drug therapy without proven benefit. As techniques evolve and become more cost effective, the use of molecular testing may prove to add more specificity and improve outcomes for a larger number of patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer (mccRCC) portends a poor prognosis and urgently requires better clinical tools for prognostication as well as for prediction of response to treatment. Considerable investment in molecular risk stratification has sought to overcome the performance ceiling encountered by methods restricted to traditional clinical parameters. However, replication of results has proven challenging, and intratumoural heterogeneity (ITH) may confound attempts at tissue-based stratification.; METHODS: We investigated the influence of confounding ITH on the performance of a novel molecular prognostic model, enabled by pathologist-guided multiregion sampling (n=183) of geographically separated mccRCC cohorts from the SuMR trial (development, n=22) and the SCOTRRCC study (validation, n=22). Tumour protein levels quantified by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) were investigated alongside clinical variables. Regularised wrapper selection identified features for Cox multivariate analysis with overall survival as the primary endpoint.; RESULTS: The optimal subset of variables in the final stratification model consisted of N-cadherin, EPCAM, Age, mTOR (NEAT). Risk groups from NEAT had a markedly different prognosis in the validation cohort (log-rank p=7.62*10-7; hazard ratio (HR) 37.9, 95% confidence interval 4.1-353.8) and 2-year survival rates (accuracy=82%, Matthews correlation coefficient=0.62). Comparisons with established clinico-pathological scores suggest favourable performance for NEAT (Net reclassification improvement 7.1% vs International Metastatic Database Consortium score, 25.4% vs Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center score). Limitations include the relatively small cohorts and associated wide confidence intervals on predictive performance. Our multiregion sampling approach enabled investigation of NEAT validation when limiting the number of samples analysed per tumour, which significantly degraded performance. Indeed, sample selection could change risk group assignment for 64% of patients, and prognostication with one sample per patient performed only slightly better than random expectation (median logHR=0.109). Low grade tissue was associated with 3.5-fold greater variation in predicted risk than high grade (p=0.044).; CONCLUSIONS: This case study in mccRCC quantitatively demonstrates the critical importance of tumour sampling for the success of molecular biomarker studies research where ITH is a factor. The NEAT model shows promise for mccRCC prognostication and warrants follow-up in larger cohorts. Our work evidences actionable parameters to guide sample collection (tumour coverage, size, grade) to inform the development of reproducible molecular risk stratification methods.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical summaries are electronic health record (EHR)-generated documents given to hospitalised patients during the discharge process to review their hospital stays and inform postdischarge care. Presently, it is unclear whether clinical summaries include relevant content or whether healthcare organisations configure their EHRs to generate content in a way that promotes patient self-management after hospital discharge. We assessed clinical summaries in three relevant domains: (1) content; (2) organisation; and (3) readability, understandability and actionability.; METHODS: Two authors performed independent retrospective chart reviews of 100 clinical summaries generated at two Michigan hospitals using different EHR vendors for patients discharged 1 April -30 June 2014. We developed an audit tool based on the Meaningful Use view-download-transmit objective and the Society of Hospital Medicine Discharge Checklist (content); the Institute of Medicine recommendations for distributing easy-to-understand print material (organisation); and five readability formulas and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (readability, understandability and actionability).; RESULTS: Clinical summaries averaged six pages (range 3-12). Several content elements were universally auto-populated into clinical summaries (eg, medication lists); others were not (eg, care team). Eighty-five per cent of clinical summaries contained discharge instructions, more often generated from third-party sources than manually entered by clinicians. Clinical summaries contained an average of 14 unique messages, including non-clinical elements irrelevant to postdischarge care. Medication list organisation reflected reconciliation mandates, and dosing charts, when present, did not carry column headings over to subsequent pages. Summaries were written at the 8th-12th grade reading level and scored poorly on assessments of understandability and actionability. Inter-rater reliability was strong for most elements in our audit tool.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights opportunities to improve clinical summaries for guiding patients' postdischarge care.

AB Trials involving genomic-driven treatment selection require the coordination of many teams interacting with a great variety of information. The need of better informatics support to manage this complex set of operations motivated the creation of OpenGeneMed. OpenGeneMed is a stand-alone and customizable version of GeneMed (Zhao et al. GeneMed: an informatics hub for the coordination of next-generation sequencing studies that support precision oncology clinical trials. Cancer Inform 2015;14(Suppl 2):45), a web-based interface developed for the National Cancer Institute Molecular Profiling-based Assignment of Cancer Therapy (NCI-MPACT) clinical trial coordinated by the NIH. OpenGeneMed streamlines clinical trial management and it can be used by clinicians, lab personnel, statisticians and researchers as a communication hub. It automates the annotation of genomic variants identified by sequencing tumor DNA, classifies the actionable mutations according to customizable rules and facilitates quality control in reviewing variants. The system generates summarized reports with detected genomic alterations that a treatment review team can use for treatment assignment. OpenGeneMed allows collaboration to happen seamlessly along the clinical pipeline; it helps reduce errors made transferring data between groups and facilitates clear documentation along the pipeline. OpenGeneMed is distributed as a stand-alone virtual machine, ready for deployment and use from a web browser; its code is customizable to address specific needs of different clinical trials and research teams. Examples on how to change the code are provided in the technical documentation distributed with the virtual machine. In summary, OpenGeneMed offers an initial set of features inspired by our experience with GeneMed, a system that has been proven to be efficient and successful for coordinating the application of next-generation sequencing in the NCI-MPACT trial.

AB Significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). New insights into the biology and genetics of ALL as well as novel clinical observations and new drugs are changing the way we diagnose, risk-stratify and treat adult patients with ALL. New genetic subtypes and alterations refine risk stratification and uncover new actionable therapeutic targets. The incorporation of more intensive, paediatric and paediatric-inspired approaches for young adults seem to have a positive impact on survival in this population. Minimal residual disease at different time points can assist in tailoring risk-adapted interventions for patients based on individual response. Finally, novel targeted approaches with monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies and small molecules are moving through clinical development and entering the clinic. The aim of this review is to consolidate the abundance of emerging data and to review and revisit the concepts of risk-stratification, choice of induction and post-remission strategies as well as to discuss and update the approach to specific populations with ALL, such as young adult, elderly/unfit and relapsed/refractory patients with ALL. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB High-throughput genomic analyses may improve outcomes in patients with advanced cancers. MOSCATO 01 is a prospective clinical trial evaluating the clinical benefit of this approach. Nucleic acids were extracted from fresh-frozen tumor biopsies and analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization, next-generation sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The primary objective was to evaluate clinical benefit as measured by the percentage of patients presenting progression-free survival (PFS) on matched therapy (PFS2) 1.3-fold longer than the PFS on prior therapy (PFS1). A total of 1,035 adult patients were included, and a biopsy was performed in 948. An actionable molecular alteration was identified in 411 of 843 patients with a molecular portrait. A total of 199 patients were treated with a targeted therapy matched to a genomic alteration. The PFS2/PFS1 ratio was >1.3 in 33% of the patients (63/193). Objective responses were observed in 22 of 194 patients (11%; 95% CI, 7%-17%), and median overall survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 9.5-14.3 months).Significance: This study suggests that high-throughput genomics could improve outcomes in a subset of patients with hard-to-treat cancers. Although these results are encouraging, only 7% of the successfully screened patients benefited from this approach. Randomized trials are needed to validate this hypothesis and to quantify the magnitude of benefit. Expanding drug access could increase the percentage of patients who benefit.

AB Tumor genetic testing is standard of care for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, but the fraction of patients who derive clinical benefit remains undefined. Here, we report the experience of 860 patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma analyzed prospectively for mutations in >300 cancer-associated genes. Potentially actionable genetic events were stratified into one of four levels based upon published clinical or laboratory evidence that the mutation in question confers increased sensitivity to standard or investigational therapies. Overall, 37.1% (319/860) of patients received a matched therapy guided by their tumor molecular profile. Excluding alterations associated with standard-of-care therapy, 14.4% (69/478) received matched therapy, with a clinical benefit of 52%. Use of matched therapy was strongly influenced by the level of preexistent clinical evidence that the mutation identified predicts for drug response. Analysis of genes mutated significantly more often in tumors without known actionable mutations nominated STK11 and KEAP1 as possible targetable mitogenic drivers.Significance: An increasing number of therapies that target molecular alterations required for tumor maintenance and progression have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The data reported here suggest that broader, early testing for molecular alterations that have not yet been recognized as standard-of-care predictive biomarkers of drug response could accelerate the development of targeted agents for rare mutational events and could result in improved clinical outcomes.

AB The AACR Project GENIE is an international data-sharing consortium focused on generating an evidence base for precision cancer medicine by integrating clinical-grade cancer genomic data with clinical outcome data for tens of thousands of cancer patients treated at multiple institutions worldwide. In conjunction with the first public data release from approximately 19,000 samples, we describe the goals, structure, and data standards of the consortium and report conclusions from high-level analysis of the initial phase of genomic data. We also provide examples of the clinical utility of GENIE data, such as an estimate of clinical actionability across multiple cancer types (>30%) and prediction of accrual rates to the NCI-MATCH trial that accurately reflect recently reported actual match rates. The GENIE database is expected to grow to >100,000 samples within 5 years and should serve as a powerful tool for precision cancer medicine.Significance: The AACR Project GENIE aims to catalyze sharing of integrated genomic and clinical datasets across multiple institutions worldwide, and thereby enable precision cancer medicine research, including the identification of novel therapeutic targets, design of biomarker-driven clinical trials, and identification of genomic determinants of response to therapy.

AB Biliary tract cancers (BTC), including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, are poor-prognosis and low-incidence cancers, although the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is rising. A minority of patients present with resectable disease but relapse rates are high; benefit from adjuvant capecitabine chemotherapy has been demonstrated. Cisplatin/gemcitabine combination chemotherapy has emerged as the reference first-line treatment regimen; there is no standard second-line therapy. Selected patients may be suitable for liver-directed therapy (e.g., radioembolization or external beam radiation), pending confirmation of benefit in randomized studies. Initial trials targeting the epithelial growth factor receptor and angiogenesis pathways have failed to deliver new treatments. Emerging data from next-generation sequencing analyses have identified actionable mutations (e.g., FGFR fusion rearrangements and IDH1 and IDH2 mutations), with several targeted drugs entering clinical development with encouraging results. The role of systemic therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy for BTC, is rapidly evolving and is the subject of this review.Significance: The authors address genetic drivers and molecular biology from a translational perspective, in an intent to offer a clear view of the recent past, present, and future of BTC. The review describes a state-of-the-art update of the current status and future directions of research and therapy in advanced BTC.

AB Multiple myeloma remains treatable but incurable. Despite a growing armamentarium of effective agents, choice of therapy, especially in relapse, still relies almost exclusively on clinical acumen. We have developed a system, Ex vivo Mathematical Myeloma Advisor (EMMA), consisting of patient-specific mathematical models parameterized by an ex vivo assay that reverse engineers the intensity and heterogeneity of chemosensitivity of primary cells from multiple myeloma patients, allowing us to predict clinical response to up to 31 drugs within 5 days after bone marrow biopsy. From a cohort of 52 multiple myeloma patients, EMMA correctly classified 96% as responders/nonresponders and correctly classified 79% according to International Myeloma Working Group stratification of level of response. We also observed a significant correlation between predicted and actual tumor burden measurements (Pearson r = 0.5658, P < 0.0001). Preliminary estimates indicate that, among the patients enrolled in this study, 60% were treated with at least one ineffective agent from their therapy combination regimen, whereas 30% would have responded better if treated with another available drug or combination. Two in silico clinical trials with experimental agents ricolinostat and venetoclax, in a cohort of 19 multiple myeloma patient samples, yielded consistent results with recent phase I/II trials, suggesting that EMMA is a feasible platform for estimating clinical efficacy of drugs and inclusion criteria screening. This unique platform, specifically designed to predict therapeutic response in multiple myeloma patients within a clinically actionable time frame, has shown high predictive accuracy in patients treated with combinations of different classes of drugs. The accuracy, reproducibility, short turnaround time, and high-throughput potential of this platform demonstrate EMMA's promise as a decision support system for therapeutic management of multiple myeloma.

AB Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is a rare and difficult-to-treat malignancy, the management of which might be improved by the identification of actionable driver mutations. We interrogated 54 to 70 genes in 442 patients with CUP using targeted clinical-grade, next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Overall, 80% of patients exhibited ctDNA alterations; 66% (290/442) ≥1 characterized alteration(s), excluding variants of unknown significance. TP53-associated genes were most commonly altered [37.8% (167/442)], followed by genes involved in the MAPK pathway [31.2% (138/442)], PI3K signaling [18.1% (80/442)], and the cell-cycle machinery [10.4% (46/442)]. Among 290 patients harboring characterized alterations, distinct genomic profiles were observed in 87.9% (255/290) of CUP cases, with 99.7% (289/290) exhibiting potentially targetable alterations. An illustrative patient with dynamic changes in ctDNA content during therapy and a responder given a checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen because of a mismatch repair gene anomaly are presented. Our results demonstrate that ctDNA evaluation is feasible in CUP and that most patients harbor a unique somatic profile with pharmacologically actionable alterations, justifying the inclusion of noninvasive liquid biopsies in next-generation clinical trials.

AB The basis for molecular and cellular heterogeneity in ependymomas of the central nervous system is not understood. This study suggests a basis for this phenomenon in the selection for mitogen-independent (MI) stem-like cells with impaired proliferation but increased intracranial tumorigenicity. MI ependymoma cell lines created by selection for EGF/FGF2-independent proliferation exhibited constitutive activation of EGFR, AKT, and STAT3 and sensitization to the antiproliferative effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). One highly tumorigenic MI line harbored membrane-bound, constitutively active, truncated EGFR. Two EGFR mutants (DeltaN566 and DeltaN599) were identified as products of intrachromosomal rearrangements fusing the 3' coding portion of the EGFR gene to the 5'-UTR of the SEC61G, yielding products lacking the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor while retaining the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. EGFR TKI efficiently targeted DeltaN566/DeltaN599-mutant-mediated signaling and prolonged the survival of mice bearing intracranial xenografts of MI cells harboring these mutations. RT-PCR sequencing of 16 childhood ependymoma samples identified SEC61G-EGFR chimeric mRNAs in one infratentorial ependymoma WHO III, arguing that this fusion occurs in a small proportion of these tumors. Our findings demonstrate how in vitro culture selections applied to genetically heterogeneous tumors can help identify focal mutations that are potentially pharmaceutically actionable in rare cancers.

AB Enhancements in clinical-grade next-generation sequencing (NGS) have fueled the advancement of precision medicine in the clinical oncology field. Here, we survey the molecular profiles of 1,113 patients with diverse malignancies who successfully underwent clinical-grade NGS (236-404 genes) in an academic tertiary cancer center. Among the individual tumors examined, the majority showed at least one detectable alteration (97.2%). Among 2,045 molecular aberrations was the involvement of 302 distinct genes. The most commonly altered genes were TP53 (47.0%), CDKN2A (18.0%), TERT (17.0%), and KRAS (16.0%), and the majority of patients had tumors that harbored multiple alterations. Tumors displayed a median of four alterations (range, 0-29). Most individuals had at least one potentially actionable alteration (94.7%), with the median number of potentially actionable alterations per patient being 2 (range, 0-13). A total of 1,048 (94.2%) patients exhibited a unique molecular profile, with either genes altered or loci within the gene(s) altered being distinct. Approximately 13% of patients displayed a genomic profile identical to at least one other patient; although genes altered were the same, the affected loci may have differed. Overall, our results underscore the complex heterogeneity of malignancies and argue that customized combination therapies will be essential to optimize cancer treatment regimens.

AB Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive soft-tissue malignancy characterized by expression of SS18-SSX fusions, where treatment options are limited. To identify therapeutically actionable genetic dependencies in SS, we performed a series of parallel, high-throughput small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens and compared genetic dependencies in SS tumor cells with those in >130 non-SS tumor cell lines. This approach revealed a reliance of SS tumor cells upon the DNA damage response serine/threonine protein kinase ATR. Clinical ATR inhibitors (ATRi) elicited a synthetic lethal effect in SS tumor cells and impaired growth of SS patient-derived xenografts. Oncogenic SS18-SSX family fusion genes are known to alter the composition of the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex, causing ejection and degradation of wild-type SS18 and the tumor suppressor SMARCB1. Expression of oncogenic SS18-SSX fusion proteins caused profound ATRi sensitivity and a reduction in SS18 and SMARCB1 protein levels, but an SSX18-SSX1 Delta71-78 fusion containing a C-terminal deletion did not. ATRi sensitivity in SS was characterized by an increase in biomarkers of replication fork stress (increased gammaH2AX, decreased replication fork speed, and increased R-loops), an apoptotic response, and a dependence upon cyclin E expression. Combinations of cisplatin or PARP inhibitors enhanced the antitumor cell effect of ATRi, suggesting that either single-agent ATRi or combination therapy involving ATRi might be further assessed as candidate approaches for SS treatment.

AB Cancer immunotherapy can induce long lasting responses in patients with metastatic cancers of a wide range of histologies. Broadening the clinical applicability of these treatments requires an improved understanding of the mechanisms limiting cancer immunotherapy. The interactions between the immune system and cancer cells are continuous, dynamic, and evolving from the initial establishment of a cancer cell to the development of metastatic disease, which is dependent on immune evasion. As the molecular mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy are elucidated, actionable strategies to prevent or treat them may be derived to improve clinical outcomes for patients.

AB Secreted proteins in the bone marrow microenvironment play critical roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through an exvivo functional screen of 94 cytokines, we identified that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) elicited profound expansion of myeloid progenitors in 67% of AML patients while suppressing the growth of normal progenitors. Levels of IL-1beta and IL-1 receptors were increased inAML patients, and silencing of the IL-1 receptor led to significant suppression of clonogenicity and invivo disease progression. IL-1 promoted AML cell growth by enhancing p38MAPK phosphorylation and promoting secretion of various other growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with p38MAPK inhibitors reversed these effects and recovered normal CD34+ cells from IL-1-mediated growth suppression. These results highlight the importance of exvivo functional screening to identify common and actionable extrinsic pathways in genetically heterogeneous malignancies and provide impetus for clinical development of IL-1/IL1R1/p38MAPK pathway-targeted therapies in AML.

AB Population-based carrier screening is limited to well-studied or high-impact genetic conditions for which the benefits may outweigh the associated harms and costs. As the cost of genome sequencing declines and availability increases, the balance of risks and benefits may change for a much larger number of genetic conditions, including medically actionable additional findings. We designed an RCT to evaluate genomic clinical sequencing for women and partners considering a pregnancy. All results are placed into the medical record for use by healthcare providers. Through quantitative and qualitative measures, including baseline and post result disclosure surveys, post result disclosure interviews, 1-2year follow-up interviews, and team journaling, we are obtaining data about the clinical and personal utility of genomic carrier screening in this population. Key outcomes include the number of reportable carrier and additional findings, and the comparative cost, utilization, and psychosocial impacts of usual care vs. genomic carrier screening. As the study progresses, we will compare the costs of genome sequencing and usual care as well as the cost of screening, pattern of use of genetic or mental health counseling services, number of outpatient visits, and total healthcare costs. This project includes novel investigation into human reactions and responses from would-be parents who are learning information that could both affect a future pregnancy and their own health.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The objective of this review was to summarize evidence gathered for the prognostic value of routine and novel blood lipids and lipoproteins measured in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).; RECENT FINDINGS: Data supports clear association with risk and actionable value for non-high-density lipoprotein (Non-HDL) cholesterol and plasma ceramides in a setting of ACS. The prognostic value and clinical actionability of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in ACS have not been thoroughly tested, while the data for omega-3 fatty acids and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) are either untested or more varied. Measuring basic lipids, which should include Non-HDL cholesterol, at the time of presentation for ACS is guideline mandated. Plasma ceramides also provide useful information to guide both treatment decisions and follow-up. Additional studies targeting ACS patients are necessary for apoB, Lp(a), omega-3 fatty acids, and Ox-LDL.

AB BACKGROUND: During lead identification and optimization, the advancement criteria may be driven based on scientific principles, prior experiences, and/or by examining the path paved by approved drugs. However, accessing the discovery data on physicochemical and ADME properties of the approved kinase inhibitors is a monumental task as these are either scattered in the literature or have not been published.; OBJECTIVE: Our goals were: 1) To compile the relevant data on all kinase inhibitors approved prior to 2016 for easy access by the biopharmaceutical community, 2) To provide a retrospective analysis to highlight trends and attributes which may have contributed to the "developability" of these drugs, and 3) To ignite focused debates on what constitutes "actionable", "nice-to-have", and unnecessary data. Such debates bring about more clarity on stage appropriateness of different types of information and prevent confusion due to abundance of unnecessary data, leading to more efficient and less costly drug discovery programs.; METHODS: A careful and thorough analysis of different bodies of data such as published manuscripts, and available regulatory documents were employed.; RESULTS: We were able to assemble a large body of data on the first thirty kinase inhibitors approved by US FDA since 2001.; CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have compiled physicochemical and ADME data on the first 30 approved kinase inhibitors and provided our retrospective analysis, which we hope is helpful in constructing advancement criteria in discovery programs. The examination of this data provides an opportunity to develop an opinion on data prioritization and stage appropriateness of assays.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous carcinoma in which various tumor-suppressor genes are lost by mutation, deletion, or silencing. Here we report a tumor-suppressive mode of action for growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and an unusual mechanism of its inactivation in TNBC. GDF11 promotes an epithelial, anti-invasive phenotype in 3D triple-negative cultures and intraductal xenografts by sustaining expression of E-cadherin and inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2). Surprisingly, clinical TNBCs retain the GDF11 locus and expression of the protein itself. GDF11 bioactivity is instead lost because of deficiencies in its convertase, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), causing inactive GDF11 precursor to accumulate intracellularly. PCSK5 reconstitution mobilizes the latent TNBC reservoir of GDF11 invitro and suppresses triple-negative mammary cancer metastasis to the lung of syngeneic hosts. Intracellular GDF11 retention adds to the concept oftumor-suppressor inactivation and reveals a cell-biological vulnerability for TNBCs lacking therapeutically actionable mutations.

AB BACKGROUND: Inpatient care is a fundamental part of gastroenterology training and involves the recommendation, performance, and interpretation of diagnostic tests. However, test results are not always communicated to patients or treating providers. We determined the process of communication of test results and recommendations in our inpatient gastroenterology (GI) consult service.; METHODS: Test recommendations on 304 consecutive new GI consults (age 60.2±1.0year) over a 2-month period were recorded. Demographic factors (age, race, gender, zip code, insurance status) were extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR). Charts were independently reviewed 6months later to determine results of recommended tests, follow-up of actionable test results, 30-day readmission rates, and predictors of suboptimal communication.; RESULTS: Of 490 recommended tests, 437 (89.2%) were performed, and 199 (45.5%) had actionable findings. Of these, 48 (24.1%) did not have documented follow-up. Failure of follow-up was higher for upper endoscopy (31.9%) compared to colonoscopy (18.0%, p=0.07). Women (p=0.07), patients on Medicare (p=0.05), and procedures supervised by advanced GI fellows (p=0.06) were less likely to receive follow-up. Median income and identification of a primary provider did not influence follow-up rates; 30-day readmission rates were not impacted. Female gender, insurance (Medicare) status, and attending type remained independent predictors of failure of follow-up on multivariate regression (p≤0.03).; CONCLUSIONS: Failure to follow up test results on inpatient services at a large academic center was unacceptably high. Maximizing personnel participation together with diligence and technology (EMR) will be required to improve communication.

AB Knowledge of variant pathogenicity is key to implementing genomic medicine. We describe variability between expert reviewers in assigning pathogenicity to sequence variants in LDLR, the causal gene in the majority of cases of familial hypercholesterolemia. LDLR was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform (average read depth >200 * ) in 1013 Mayo Biobank participants recruited from 2012 to 2013. Variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) <5% predicted to be functional or referenced in HGMD (Human Gene Mutation Database) or NCBI-ClinVar databases were reviewed. To assign pathogenicity, variant frequency in population data sets, computational predictions, reported observations and patient-level data including electronic health record-based post hoc phenotyping were leveraged. Of 178 LDLR variants passing quality control, 25 were selected for independent review using either an in-house protocol or a disease/gene-specific semi-quantitative framework based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-recommended lines of evidence. NCBI-ClinVar included interpretations for all queried variants with 74% (14/19) of variants with >1 submitter showing inconsistency in classification and 26% (5/19) appearing with conflicting clinical actionability. The discordance rate (one-step level of disagreement out of five classes in variant interpretation) between the reviewers was 40% (10/25). Two LDLR variants were independently deemed clinically actionable and returnable. Interpretation of LDLR variants was often discordant among ClinVar submitters and between expert reviewers. A quantitative approach based on strength of each predefined criterion in the context of specific genes and phenotypes may yield greater consistency between different reviewers.

AB CONTEXT: Recent whole genome mRNA expression profiling studies revealed that bladder cancers can be grouped into molecular subtypes, some of which share clinical properties and gene expression patterns with the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer and the molecular subtypes found in other solid tumors. The molecular subtypes in other solid tumors are enriched with specific mutations and copy number aberrations that are thought to underlie their distinct progression patterns, and biological and clinical properties.; OBJECTIVE: The availability of comprehensive genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large projects made it possible to correlate the presence of DNA alterations with tumor molecular subtype membership. Our overall goal was to determine whether specific DNA mutations and/or copy number variations are enriched in specific molecular subtypes.; EVIDENCE: We used the complete TCGA RNA-seq dataset and three different published classifiers developed by our groups to assign TCGA's bladder cancers to molecular subtypes, and examined the prevalence of the most common DNA alterations within them. We interpreted the results against the background of what was known from the published literature about the prevalence of these alterations in nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancers.; EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The results confirmed that alterations involving RB1 and NFE2L2 were enriched in basal cancers, whereas alterations involving FGFR3 and KDM6A were enriched in luminal tumors.; CONCLUSIONS: The results further reinforce the conclusion that the molecular subtypes of bladder cancer are distinct disease entities with specific genetic alterations.; PATIENT SUMMARY: Our observation showed that some of subtype-enriched mutations and copy number aberrations are clinically actionable, which has direct implications for the clinical management of patients with bladder cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) may provide a biologic rationale for treatment response and novel therapeutic strategies.; OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic alterations with potential clinical implications in NMIBC.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pretreatment index tumors and matched germline DNA from 105 patients with NMIBC on a prospective Institutional Review Board-approved protocol underwent targeted exon sequencing analysis in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified clinical laboratory.; OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comutation patterns and copy number alterations were compared across stage and grade. Associations between genomic alterations and recurrence after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.; RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: TERT promoter mutations (73%) and chromatin-modifying gene alterations (69%) were highly prevalent across grade and stage, suggesting these events occur early in tumorigenesis. ERBB2 or FGFR3 alterations were present in 57% of high-grade NMIBC tumors in a mutually exclusive pattern. DNA damage repair (DDR) gene alterations were seen in 30% (25/82) of high-grade NMIBC tumors, a rate similar to MIBC, and were associated with a higher mutational burden compared with tumors with intact DDR genes (p<0.001). ARID1A mutations were associated with an increased risk of recurrence after BCG (hazard ratio=3.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.51-6.51, p=0.002).; CONCLUSIONS: Next-generation sequencing of treatment-naive index NMIBC tumors demonstrated that the majority of NMIBC tumors had at least one potentially actionable alteration that could serve as a target in rationally designed trials of intravesical or systemic therapy. DDR gene alterations were frequent in high-grade NMIBC and were associated with increased mutational load, which may have therapeutic implications for BCG immunotherapy and ongoing trials of systemic checkpoint inhibitors. ARID1A mutations were associated with an increased risk of recurrence after BCG therapy. Whether ARID1A mutations represent a predictive biomarker of BCG response or are prognostic in NMIBC patients warrants further investigation.; PATIENT SUMMARY: Analysis of frequently mutated genes in superficial bladder cancer suggests potential targets for personalized treatment and predictors of treatment response, and also may help develop noninvasive tumor detection tests.

AB Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and is usually classified as angle closure and open angle glaucoma (OAG). Primary open angle glaucoma represents the most frequent clinical presentation leading to ganglion cell death and optic nerve degeneration as a main consequence of an intraocular pressure' (IOP) increase. The mechanisms of this IOP increase in such pathology remain unclear but one protein called Myocilin could be a part of the puzzle in the trabecular meshwork (TM). Previously described to be transcriptionally regulated by glucocorticoids, the comprehension of the trabecular regulation of Myocilin' expression has only weakly progressed since 15 years. Due to the essential molecular and cellular implications of retinoids' pathway in eye development and physiology, we investigate the potential role of the retinoic acid in such regulation and expression. This study demonstrates that the global retinoids signaling machinery is present in immortalized TM cells and that Myocilin (MYOC) expression is upregulated by retinoic acid alone or combined with a glucocorticoid co-treatment. This regulation by retinoic acid acts through the MYOC promoter which contains a critical cluster of four retinoic acid responsive elements (RAREs), with the RARE-DR2 presenting the strongest effect and binding the RARalpha/RXRalpha heterodimer. All together, these results open up new perspectives for the molecular understanding glaucoma pathophysiology and provide further actionable clues on Myocilin gene regulation.

AB INTRODUCTION: Treatment for children with clinically aggressive, high-risk neuroblastoma remains challenging. Less than 50% of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma will survive long-term with current therapies, and survivors are at risk for serious treatment-related late toxicities. Here, we review new and evolving treatments that may ultimately improve outcome for children with high-risk neuroblastoma with decreased potential for late adverse events.; AREAS COVERED: New strategies for treating high-risk neuroblastoma are reviewed including: radiotherapy, targeted cytotoxics, biologics, immunotherapy, and molecularly targeted agents. Recently completed and ongoing neuroblastoma clinical trials testing these novel treatments are highlighted. In addition, we discuss ongoing clinical trials designed to evaluate precision medicine approaches that target actionable somatic mutations and oncogenic cellular pathways.; EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genomic medicine and molecular biology have led to the development of early phase studies testing biologically rational therapies targeting aberrantly activated cellular pathways. Because many of these drugs have a wider therapeutic index than standard chemotherapeutic agents, these treatments may be more effective and less toxic than current strategies. However, to effectively integrate these targeted strategies, robust predictive biomarkers must be developed that will identify patients who will benefit from these approaches and rapidly match treatments to patients at diagnosis.

AB Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related death in both men and women. However, over the last few years, we have witnessed improved outcomes that are largely attributable to early detection, increased efforts in tobacco control, improved surgical approaches, and the development of novel targeted therapies. Currently, there are several novel therapies in clinical practice, including those targeting actionable mutations and more recently immunotherapeutic agents. Immunotherapy represents the most significant step forward in eradicating this deadly disease. Given the ever-changing landscape of lung cancer management, here we present an overview of the most recent advances in the management of non-small cell lung cancer.

AB Rampant inter-patient and intra-tumor heterogeneity present formidable challenges in the clinical management of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and mandate a "divide-and-conquer" approach wherein deep biomarker profiling drives patient segmentation and development of customized treatments. Genomic and proteomic studies have uncovered several TNBC subtypes each of which represents a distinct disease pathobiology and harbors unique actionable targets that may illuminate sensitivities to specific classes of therapeutics. This review details the mind-boggling complexity of TNBC, its ramifications for prognosis and therapeutic response, and discusses what treatments might befit each TNBC subtype. Additionally, focused efforts geared toward translating these findings into the clinic are urged. This review also supports an evidence-based paradigm shift towards inclusion of agents that target the mechanisms that drive intra-tumor heterogeneity, in order to improve long-term outcomes for TNBC patients.

AB The development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering has painted a great future for the bio-based economy, including fuels, chemicals, and drugs produced from renewable feedstocks. With the rapid advance of genome-scale modeling, pathway assembling and genome engineering/editing, our ability to design and generate microbial cell factories with various phenotype becomes almost limitless. However, our lack of ability to measure and exert precise control over metabolite concentration related phenotypes becomes a bottleneck in metabolic engineering. Genetically encoded small molecule biosensors, which provide the means to couple metabolite concentration to measurable or actionable outputs, are highly promising solutions to the bottleneck. Here we review recent advances in the design, optimization and application of small molecule biosensor in metabolic engineering, with particular focus on optimization strategies for transcription factor (TF) based biosensors.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains as one of the most common cause of worldwide cancer morbidity and mortality. Improvements in surgical modalities and adjuvant chemotherapy have increased the cure rates in early stage disease, but a significant portion of the patients will develop recurrence or advanced disease. The efficacy of chemotherapy of recurrence and advanced CRC has improved significantly over the last decade. Previously, the historical drug 5-fluorouracil was used as single chemotherapeutic agent. Now with the addition of other drugs such as capecitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib, the median survival of patients with advanced CRC has significantly improved from less than a year to the current standard of almost 2 years. However, the side effects of systemic therapy such as toxicity may cause fatal complications and have a major consequences on the patients' quality of life. Hence, there is an urgent need for key biomarkers which will enable the selection of optimal drug singly or in combination for an individual patient. The application of personalized therapy based on DNA testing could aid the clinicians in providing the most effective chemotherapy agents and dose modifications for each patient. Yet, some of the current findings are controversial and the evidences are conflicting. This review aims at summarizing the current state of knowledge about germline pharmacogenomics DNA variants that are currently used to guide therapeutic decisions and variants that have the potential to be clinically useful in the future. In addition, current updates on germline variants conferring treatment sensitivity, drug resistance to existing chemotherapy agents and variants affecting prognosis and survival will also be emphasized. Different alteration in the same gene might confer resistance or enhanced sensitivity; and while most of other published reviews generally stated only the gene name and codon location, we will specifically discuss the exact variants to offer more accurate information in this mini review.

AB Disclaimer: These recommendations are designed primarily as an educational resource for medical geneticists and other healthcare providers to help them provide quality medical services. Adherence to these recommendations is completely voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These recommendations should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinician should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific clinical circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinicians are encouraged to document the reasons for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with this statement. Clinicians also are advised to take notice of the date this statement was adopted and to consider other medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures.To promote standardized reporting of actionable information from clinical genomic sequencing, in 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a minimum list of genes to be reported as incidental or secondary findings. The goal was to identify and manage risks for selected highly penetrant genetic disorders through established interventions aimed at preventing or significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. The ACMG subsequently established the Secondary Findings Maintenance Working Group to develop a process for curating and updating the list over time. We describe here the new process for accepting and evaluating nominations for updates to the secondary findings list. We also report outcomes from six nominations received in the initial 15 months after the process was implemented. Applying the new process while upholding the core principles of the original policy statement resulted in the addition of four genes and removal of one gene; one gene did not meet criteria for inclusion. The updated secondary findings minimum list includes 59 medically actionable genes recommended for return in clinical genomic sequencing. We discuss future areas of focus, encourage continued input from the medical community, and call for research on the impact of returning genomic secondary findings.Genet Med 19 2, 249-255.

AB PurposeClinVar is increasingly used as a resource for both genetic variant interpretation and clinical practice. However, controversies exist regarding the consistency of classifications in ClinVar, and questions remain about how best to use these data. Our study systematically examined ClinVar to identify common sources of discordance and thus inform ongoing practices.MethodsWe analyzed variants that had multiple classifications in ClinVar, excluding benign polymorphisms. Classifications were categorized by potential actionability and pathogenicity. Consensus interpretations were calculated for each variant, and the properties of the discordant outlier classifications were summarized.ResultsOur study included 74,065 classifications of 27,224 unique variants in 1,713 genes. We found that (i) concordance rates differed among clinical areas and variant types; (ii) clinical testing methods had much higher concordance than basic literature curation and research efforts; (iii) older classifications had greater discordance than newer ones; and (iv) low-penetrance variants had particularly high discordance.ConclusionRecent variant classifications from clinical testing laboratories have high overall concordance in many (but not all) clinical areas. ClinVar can be a reliable resource supporting variant interpretation, quality assessment, and clinical practice when factors uncovered in this study are taken into account. Ongoing improvements to ClinVar may make it easier to use, particularly for nonexpert users.

AB BACKGROUND: The return of research results (RoR) remains a complex and well-debated issue. Despite the debate, actual data related to the experience of giving individual results back, and the impact these results may have on clinical care and health outcomes, is sorely lacking. Through the work of the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (APGI) we: (1) delineate the pathway back to the patient where actionable research data were identified; and (2) report the clinical utilisation of individual results returned. Using this experience, we discuss barriers and opportunities associated with a comprehensive process of RoR in large-scale genomic research that may be useful for others developing their own policies.; METHODS: We performed whole-genome (n=184) and exome (n=208) sequencing of matched tumour-normal DNA pairs from 392 patients with sporadic pancreatic cancer (PC) as part of the APGI. We identified pathogenic germline mutations in candidate genes (n=130) with established predisposition to PC or medium-high penetrance genes with well-defined cancer associated syndromes or phenotypes. Variants from candidate genes were annotated and classified according to international guidelines. Variants were considered actionable if clinical utility was established, with regard to prevention, diagnosis, prognostication and/or therapy.; RESULTS: A total of 48,904 germline variants were identified, with 2356 unique variants undergoing annotation and in silico classification. Twenty cases were deemed actionable and were returned via previously described RoR framework, representing an actionable finding rate of 5.1%. Overall, 1.78% of our cohort experienced clinical benefit from RoR.; CONCLUSION: Returning research results within the context of large-scale genomics research is a labour-intensive, highly variable, complex operation. Results that warrant action are not infrequent, but the prevalence of those who experience a clinical difference as a result of returning individual results is currently low.

AB BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cancer gene panels are widely applied to enable personalized cancer therapy and to identify novel oncogenic mutations.; METHODS: We performed targeted NGS on 932 clinical cases of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot panel v2 assay.; RESULTS: Actionable mutations were identified in 65% of the cases with available targeted therapeutic options, including 26% of the patients with mutations in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline genes. Most notably, we discovered JAK2 p.V617F somatic mutation, a hallmark of myeloproliferative neoplasms, in 1% (9/932) of the NSCLCs. Analysis of cancer cell line pharmacogenomic data showed that a high level of JAK2 expression in a panel of NSCLC cell lines is correlated with increased sensitivity to a selective JAK2 inhibitor. Further analysis of TCGA genomic data revealed JAK2 gain or loss due to genetic alterations in NSCLC clinical samples are associated with significantly elevated or reduced PD-L1 expression, suggesting that the activating JAK2 p.V617F mutation could confer sensitivity to both JAK inhibitors and anti-PD1 immunotherapy. We also detected JAK3 germline activating mutations in 6.7% (62/932) of the patients who may benefit from anti-PD1 treatment, in light of recent findings that JAK3 mutations upregulate PD-L1 expression.; CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study demonstrated the clinical utility of targeted NGS with a focused hotspot cancer gene panel in NSCLCs and identified activating mutations in JAK2 and JAK3 with clinical implications inferred through integrative analysis of cancer genetic, genomic, and pharmacogenomic data. The potential of JAK2 and JAK3 mutations as response markers for the targeted therapy against JAK kinases or anti-PD1 immunotherapy warrants further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND: Intertumoral heterogeneity represents a significant hurdle to identifying optimized targeted therapies in gastric cancer (GC). To realize precision medicine for GC patients, an actionable gene alteration-based molecular classification that directly associates GCs with targeted therapies is needed.; METHODS: A total of 207 Japanese patients with GC were included in this study. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues were obtained from surgical or biopsy specimens and were subjected to DNA extraction. We generated comprehensive genomic profiling data using a 435-gene panel including 69 actionable genes paired with US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapies, and the evaluation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and microsatellite instability (MSI) status.; RESULTS: Comprehensive genomic sequencing detected at least one alteration of 435 cancer-related genes in 194 GCs (93.7%) and of 69 actionable genes in 141 GCs (68.1%). We classified the 207 GCs into four The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtypes using the genomic profiling data; EBV (N=9), MSI (N=17), chromosomal instability (N=119), and genomically stable subtype (N=62). Actionable gene alterations were not specific and were widely observed throughout all TCGA subtypes. To discover a novel classification which more precisely selects candidates for targeted therapies, 207 GCs were classified using hypermutated phenotype and the mutation profile of 69 actionable genes. We identified a hypermutated group (N=32), while the others (N=175) were sub-divided into six clusters including five with actionable gene alterations: ERBB2 (N=25), CDKN2A, and CDKN2B (N=10), KRAS (N=10), BRCA2 (N=9), and ATM cluster (N=12). The clinical utility of this classification was demonstrated by a case of unresectable GC with a remarkable response to anti-HER2 therapy in the ERBB2 cluster.; CONCLUSIONS: This actionable gene-based classification creates a framework for further studies for realizing precision medicine in GC.

AB BACKGROUND: Providers have traditionally established priorities for quality improvement; however, patients and their family members have recently become involved in priority setting. Little is known about how to reconcile priorities of different stakeholder groups into a single prioritized list that is actionable for organizations.; OBJECTIVE: To describe the decision-making process for establishing consensus used by a diverse panel of stakeholders to reconcile two sets of quality improvement priorities (provider/decision maker priorities n=9; patient/family priorities n=19) into a single prioritized list.; DESIGN: We employed a modified Delphi process with a diverse group of panellists to reconcile priorities for improving care of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Proceedings were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis to explore the decision-making process for establishing consensus.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nine panellists including three providers, three decision makers and three family members of previously critically ill patients.; RESULTS: Panellists rated and revised 28 priorities over three rounds of review and reached consensus on the "Top 5" priorities for quality improvement: transition of patient care from ICU to hospital ward; family presence and effective communication; delirium screening and management; early mobilization; and transition of patient care between ICU providers. Four themes were identified as important for establishing consensus: storytelling (sharing personal experiences), amalgamating priorities (negotiating priority scope), considering evaluation criteria and having a priority champion.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating families of patients into a multistakeholder prioritization exercise. The approach described can be used to guide consensus building and reconcile priorities of diverse stakeholder groups. © 2017 The Authors Health Expectations Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: state-of-the-art algorithms that quantify nonlinear dynamics in physiologic waveforms are underutilized clinically due to their esoteric nature. We present a generalizable framework for classifying multiscalar waveform features, designed for patient-state tracking directly at the bedside.; METHODS: an artificial neural network classifier was designed to evaluate multiscale waveform features against a fingerprint database of multifractal synthetic time series. The results are mapped into a physiologic state space for near real-time patient-state tracking.; RESULTS: the framework was validated on cardiac beat-to-beat dynamics processed with the multiscale entropy algorithm, and assessed using PhysioNet databases. We then applied our algorithm to predict 28-day mortality for sepsis patients, and found it had greater prognostic accuracy than standard clinical severity scores.; CONCLUSION: we developed a novel framework to classify multiscale features of beat-to-beat dynamics, and performed an initial clinical validation to demonstrate that our approach generates a robust quantification of a patient's state, compatible with real-time bedside implementations.; SIGNIFICANCE: the framework generates meaningful and actionable patient-specific information, and could facilitate the dissemination of a new class of "always-on" diagnostic tools.

AB Importance: Despite a decade of effort by national stakeholders to bring cancer survivorship to the forefront of primary care, there is little evidence to suggest that primary care has begun to integrate comprehensive services to manage the care of long-term cancer survivors.; Objective: To explain why primary care has not begun to integrate comprehensive cancer survivorship services.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Comparative case study of 12 advanced primary care practices in the United States recruited from March 2015 to February 2017. Practices were selected from a national registry of 151 workforce innovators compiled for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Practices were recruited to include diversity in policy context and organizational structure. Researchers conducted 10 to 12 days of ethnographic data collection in each practice, including interviews with practice personnel and patient pathways with cancer survivors. Fieldnotes, transcripts, and practice documents were analyzed within and across cases to identify salient themes.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Description of cancer survivorship care delivery in advanced patient-centered medical homes, including identification of barriers and promotional factors related to that care.; Results: The 12 practices came from multiple states and policy contexts and had a mix of clinicians trained in family or internal medicine. All but 3 were recognized as National Committee on Quality Assurance level 3 patient-centered medical homes. None of the practices provided any type of comprehensive cancer survivorship services. Three interdependent explanatory factors emerged: the absence of a recognized, distinct clinical category of survivorship in primary care; a lack of actionable information to treat this patient population; and current information systems unable to support survivorship care.; Conclusions and Relevance: To increase the potential for primary care transformation efforts to integrate survivorship services into routine care, survivorship must become a recognized clinical category with actionable care plans supported by a functional information system infrastructure.

AB PURPOSE: Genomic profiling is increasingly used in the management of cancer. We have previously reported preliminary results of our precision medicine program. Here, we present response and survival outcomes for 637 additional patients who were referred for phase I trials and were treated with matched targeted therapy (MTT) when available.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer who underwent tumor genomic analyses were treated with MTT when available.; RESULTS: Overall, 1,179 (82.1%) of 1,436 patients had one or more alterations (median age, 59.7 years; men, 41.2%); 637 had one or more actionable aberrations and were treated with MTT (n = 390) or non-MTT (n = 247). Patients who were treated with MTT had higher rates of complete and partial response (11% v 5%; P = .0099), longer failure-free survival (FFS; 3.4 v 2.9 months; P = .0015), and longer overall survival (OS; 8.4 v 7.3 months; P = .041) than did unmatched patients. Two-month landmark analyses showed that, for MTT patients, FFS for responders versus nonresponders was 7.6 versus 4.3 months (P < .001) and OS was 23.4 versus 8.5 months (P < .001), whereas for non-MTT patients (responders v nonresponders), FFS was 6.6 versus 4.1 months (P = .001) and OS was 15.2 versus 7.5 months (P = .43). Patients with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations matched to PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin axis inhibitors alone demonstrated outcomes comparable to unmatched patients.; CONCLUSION: Our results support the use of genomic matching. Subset analyses indicate that matching patients who harbor a PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alteration to only a PI3K pathway inhibitor does not improve outcome. We have initiated IMPACT2, a randomized trial to compare treatment with and without genomic selection.

AB The increased use of genomic sequencing in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics makes imperative the development of guidelines and policies about how to handle secondary findings. For reasons both practical and ethical, the creation of these guidelines must take into consideration the informed opinions of the lay public. As part of a larger Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium project, we organized a deliberative democracy (DD) session that engaged 66 participants in dialogue about the benefits and risks associated with the return of secondary findings from clinical genomic sequencing. Participants were educated about the scientific and ethical aspects of the disclosure of secondary findings by experts in medical genetics and bioethics, and then engaged in facilitated discussion of policy options for the disclosure of three types of secondary findings: 1) medically actionable results; 2) adult onset disorders found in children; and 3) carrier status. Participants' opinions were collected via surveys administered one month before, immediately following, and one month after the DD session. Post DD session, participants were significantly more willing to support policies that do not allow access to secondary findings related to adult onset conditions in children (Chi 2 (2, N=62)=13.300, p=0.001) or carrier status (Chi 2 (2, N=60)=11.375, p=0.003). After one month, the level of support for the policy denying access to secondary findings regarding adult-onset conditions remained significantly higher than the pre-DD level, although less than immediately post-DD (Chi 2 (1, N=60)=2.465, p=0.041). Our findings suggest that education and deliberation enhance public appreciation of the scientific and ethical complexities of genome sequencing.

AB The treatment paradigm of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved into oncogene-directed precision medicine. Identifying actionable genomic alterations is the initial step towards precision medicine. An important scientific progress in molecular profiling of NSCLC over the past decade is the shift from the traditional piecemeal fashion to massively parallel sequencing with the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Another technical advance is the development of liquid biopsy with great potential in providing a dynamic and comprehensive genomic profiling of NSCLC in a minimally invasive manner. The integration of NGS with liquid biopsy has been demonstrated to play emerging roles in genomic profiling of NSCLC by increasing evidences. This review summarized the potential applications of NGS-based liquid biopsy in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC including identifying actionable genomic alterations, tracking spatiotemporal tumor evolution, dynamically monitoring response and resistance to targeted therapies, and diagnostic value in early-stage NSCLC, and discussed emerging challenges to overcome in order to facilitate clinical translation in future.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of Family History in the Electronic Health Record and to identify opportunities to advance the contributions of nurses in obtaining, updating and assessing family history in order to improve the health of all individuals and populations.; ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: The article presents an overview of the obstacles to charting Family History within the Electronic Health Record and recommendations for using specific Family History tools and core Family History data sets.; METHODS: Opportunities to advance nursing contributions in obtaining, updating, and assessing family history in order to improve the health of all individuals were identified. These opportunities are focused within the area of promoting the importance of communication within families and between healthcare providers to obtain, document, and update family histories.; FINDINGS: Nurses can increase awareness of existing resources that can guide collection of a comprehensive and accurate family history and facilitate family discussions. In this paper, opportunities to advance nursing contributions in obtaining, updating, and assessing family history in order to improve the health of all individuals were identified.; CONCLUSIONS: Aligned with the clinical preparation of nurses, family health should be used routinely by nurses for risk assessment and to help inform patient and family members on screening, health promotion, and disease prevention. The quality of family health information is critical in order to leverage the use of genomic healthcare information and derive new knowledge about disease biology, treatment efficacy, and drug safety. These actionable steps need to be performed in the context of promoting evidence-based applications of family history that will be essential for implementing personalized genomic healthcare approaches and disease prevention efforts.; CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Family health history is one of the most important tools for identifying the risk of developing rare and chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, and represents an integration of disease risk from genetic, environmental, and behavioral/lifestyle factors. In fact, family history has long been recognized as a strong independent risk factor for disease and is the current best practice used in clinical practice to guide risk assessment. © 2016 Sigma Theta Tau International.

AB OBJECTIVES: This manuscript assesses safety climate data from the National Machine Guarding Program (NMGP)-a nationwide intervention to improve machine safety.; METHODS: Baseline safety climate surveys were completed by 2161 employees and 341 owners or managers at 115 businesses. A separate onsite audit of safety management practices and machine guarding equipment was conducted at each business.; RESULTS: Safety climate measures were not correlated with machine guarding or safety management practices. The presence of a safety committee was correlated with higher scores on the safety management audit when contrasted with those without one.; CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a safety committee is easily assessed and provides a basis on which to make recommendations with regard to how it functions. Measures of safety climate fail to provide actionable information. Future research on small manufacturing firms should emphasize the presence of an employee-management safety committee.

AB Connecting people to useful, actionable health resources is a substantive challenge that sits at the heart of health communication. Digital media provides means of producing, distributing and revising content and creates possibilities for new and multiple channels for reaching and engaging audiences, particularly when combined with social media. While there is much promise of digital media forms to deliver audiences and promote engagement, the health communication landscape is still largely hit-and-miss with few 'best practice' examples to follow. Proof-of-concept studies allow for a structured, focused exploration of ways to leverage the potential of digital media and learn what approaches have the promise to invest resources in amid a sea of possible options. Think You Can Shrink? (TYCS) is a multi-episode web series modelled on a reality TV show format. The show's key objective is to educate men and demonstrate, through modelling, ways men can support other men to encourage help-seeking behaviours and greater health communication, which in turn, may also lead to better health outcomes. Given the newness of the approach, the project was launched as a proof-of-concept study to explore: (a) whether this approach could engage the interest of men, (b) what initial impact this approach might induce and (c) the kind of audiences this approach might most appeal to.

AB OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines the implementation of a comprehensive clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx) service within a pediatric teaching hospital and the integration of clinical decision support in the electronic health record (EHR).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: An approach to clinical decision support for medication ordering and dispensing driven by documented PGx variant status in an EHR is described. A web-based platform was created to automatically generate a clinical report from either raw assay results or specified diplotypes, able to parse and combine haplotypes into an interpretation for each individual and compared to the reference lab call for accuracy.; RESULTS: Clinical decision support rules built within an EHR provided guidance to providers for 31 patients (100%) who had actionable PGx variants and were written for interacting medications. A breakdown of the PGx alerts by practitioner service, and alert response for the initial cohort of patients tested is described. In 90% (355/394) of the cases, thiopurine methyltranferase genotyping was ordered pre-emptively.; DISCUSSION: This paper outlines one approach to implementing a clinical PGx service in a pediatric teaching hospital that cares for a heterogeneous patient population. There is a focus on incorporation of PGx clinical decision support rules and a program to standardize report text within the electronic health record with subsequent exploration of clinician behavior in response to the alerts.; CONCLUSION: The incorporation of PGx data at the time of prescribing and dispensing, if done correctly, has the potential to impact the incidence of adverse drug events, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. © The Author 2016.

AB INTRODUCTION: Targeted therapy significantly prolongs survival in lung adenocarcinoma. Current diagnostic guidelines include only EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) reveals more actionable genomic alterations than do standard diagnostic methods. Data on the influence of hybrid capture (HC)-based NGS on treatment are limited, and we investigated its impact on treatment decisions and clinical outcomes.; METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with advanced lung cancer on whom HC-based NGS was performed between November 2011 and October 2015. Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, treatments, and outcome data were collected.; RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included (median age 63 years [53% females, 45% never-smokers, and 85% with adenocarcinoma]). HC-based NGS was performed upfront and after EGFR/ALK testing yielded negative or inconclusive results in 15% and 85% of patients, respectively. In 51.5% of patients, HC-based NGS was performed before first-line therapy, and in 48.5%, it was performed after treatment failure. HC-based NGS identified clinically actionable genomic alterations in 50% of patients, most frequently in EGFR (18%), Ret proto-oncogene (RET) (9%), ALK (8%), Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) receptor tyrosine kinase gene (6%), and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (ERBB2) (5%). In 15 patients, it identified EGFR/ALK aberrations after negative results of prior standard testing. Treatment strategy was changed for 43 patients (42.6%). The overall response rate in these patients was 65% (complete response 14.7%, partial response 50%). Median survival was not reached. Immunotherapy was administered in 33 patients, mostly without an actionable driver, with a presenting disease control rate of 32%, and with an association with tumor mutation burden.; CONCLUSIONS: HC-based NGS influenced treatment decisions in close to half of the patients with lung adenocarcinoma and was associated with an overall response rate of 65%, which may translate into a survival benefit.

AB INTRODUCTION: In the randomized trial of standard- versus high-dose chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced (LA) NSCLC (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0617), overall survival (OS) was worse in the high-dose arm. Although heart dose was suggested as a contributing factor, actionable parameters have not been established. We present an analysis of clinical and dosimetric parameters affecting OS in this patient population, focusing on heart dose.; METHODS: Clinical data were collected on 416 patients with LA NSCLC treated at a single institution, with a subset of 333 available treatment plans recontoured using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0617 normal tissue guidelines. Toxicity and dosimetry data were analyzed for 322 patients; multivariate analysis was performed on 251 patients. Dosimetric parameters of radiation to tumor and organs at risk were analyzed with clinical data pertaining to OS, disease-free survival, and toxicity.; RESULTS: Patients were treated with radiation therapy to prescribed doses of 50.0 to 84.9 Gy (median 66.0 Gy). Median follow-up was 14.5 months. Median OS was 16.8 months. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 61.4% and 38.8%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with worse OS were increasing heart V50 (volume receiving ≥50 Gy), heart volume, lung V5 (proportion of the lung structure [excluding the target volume]) receiving at least 5 Gy), bilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement, and lack of concurrent chemotherapy. When stratified by heart V50 less than 25% versus 25% or greater, the 1-year OS rates were 70.2% versus 46.8% and the 2-year OS rates were 45.9% versus 26.7% (p < 0.0001). Median heart V50 was significantly higher (20.8% versus 13.9%, p < 0.0001) for patients with cardiac toxicity with a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade of 1 or higher.; CONCLUSIONS: Heart dose is associated with OS and cardiac toxicity for patients with LA NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy.

AB INTRODUCTION: Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase (HER2) transmembrane domain (TMD) mutations (HER2V659E, HER2G660D) have previously been identified in lung adenocarcinomas, buttheir frequency and clinical significance is unknown.; METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 8551 consecutive lung adenocarcinomas using hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) at the request of the individual treating physicians for the purpose of making therapy decisions.; RESULTS: We identified 15 cases (0.18%) of HER2 TMD mutations (HER2V659E/D, HER2G660D) through CGP of 8551 lung adenocarcinomas. HER2 TMD mutations were mutually exclusive from HER2 kinase domain mutations and other oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinoma. Only two cases with HER2 TMD mutations (13%) had concurrent Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (HER2) amplification. Structural analysis of HER2 TMD association revealed that mutations at positions V659 and G660 to the highly polar residues glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine should stabilize homodimerization and heterodimerization of HER2 in the active conformation. Treatment with afatinib, a pan-HER inhibitor, resulted in durable clinical response in three of four patients with lung adenocarcinoma, with two harboring HER2V659E and one with double HER2V659E/G660R mutations. HER2 TMD mutations (V659 and G660) are found in other non-NSCLC malignancies, and analogous TMD mutations are also found in EGFR, HER3, and HER4.; CONCLUSION: HER2 TMD mutations represent rare but distinct targetable driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma. CGP capable of detecting diverse HER2 alterations, including HER2 TMD mutations, should be broadly adopted to identify all patients who may benefit from HER2-targeted therapies.

AB INTRODUCTION: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which represents an unbiased way to assess tumor genetic profile noninvasively, facilitates studying intratumor heterogeneity. Although intratumor heterogeneity has been elucidated substantially in a few cancer types, including NSCLC, how it influences the ability of tumor cells harboring different genetic abnormalities in releasing their DNA remains elusive. We designed a capture-based panel targeting NSCLC to detect and quantify genetic alterations from plasma samples by using deep sequencing. By applying the panel to paired biopsy and plasma samples, we imputed and compared the ctDNA-releasing efficiency in subclones harboring distinct genetic variants.; METHODS: We collected 40 pairs of matched biopsy and plasma samples from patients with advanced lung cancer and applied capture-based sequencing using our LungPlasma panel, which consists of critical exons and introns of 168 genes. We derived a normalized relative allelic fraction score (NRAFS) to reflect ctDNA-releasing efficiency.; RESULTS: By using mutations detected in biopsy samples as a reference, we achieved 87.2% by-variant sensitivity, including for single-nucleotide variants, insertions or deletions, and gene fusions. Furthermore, the by-variant sensitivity for the seven most critical and actionable genes was 96.2%. The average NRAFS for subclones carrying mutations from seven actionable genes was 0.877; in contrast, the average NRAFS for other mutations was 0.658. Mutations from four genes involved in cell cycle pathways had a particularly low NRAFS (0.480) compared with the other two groups (p= 0.07).; CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that subclones carrying driver mutations are more prone to release DNA. We have also demonstrated the quantitative ability of capture-based sequencing, paving its way for routine utilization in clinical settings.

AB There is clear and consistent evidence that regular physical activity is an important component of healthy lifestyles and fundamental to promoting health and preventing disease. Despite the known benefits of physical activity participation, many people in the United States remain inactive. More specifically, physical activity behavior is socially patterned with lower participation rates among women; racial/ethnic minorities; sexual minority youth; individuals with less education; persons with physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities; individuals >65 yr of age; and those living in the southeast region of the United States. Many health-related outcomes follow a pattern that is similar to physical activity participation. In response to the problem of inequities in physical activity and overall health in the United States, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has developed a national roadmap that supports achieving health equity through a physically active lifestyle. The actionable, integrated pathways that provide the foundation of ACSM's roadmap include the following: 1) communication-raising awareness of the issue and magnitude of health inequities and conveying the power of physical activity in promoting health equity; 2) education-developing educational resources to improve cultural competency for health care providers and fitness professionals as well as developing new community-based programs for lay health workers; 3) collaboration-building partnerships and programs that integrate existing infrastructures and leverage institutional knowledge, reach, and voices of public, private, and community organizations; and 4) evaluation-ensuring that ACSM attains measurable progress in reducing physical activity disparities to promote health equity. This article provides a conceptual overview of these four pathways of ACSM's roadmap, an understanding of the challenges and advantages of implementing these components, and the organizational and economic benefits of achieving health equity.

AB INTRODUCTION: The advances in genomic technology of large populations make the potential for genomic screening of military cohorts and recruits feasible, affording the potential to identify at-risk individuals before occurrence of potentially life-threatening events. Exploring sudden cardiac death, known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in young military service members, we focused on the most common gene associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS), KCNQ1.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the publicly available database Exome Aggregation Consortium as a surrogate for a military population, variants in KCNQ1 were filtered on the basis of population prevalence, classification as a disease mutation in the Human Gene Mutation database, and classification as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in the ClinVar database. Variant prevalence and penetrance estimates were derived using reports from the medical literature.; RESULTS: We showed that in a population of over 60,000 individuals, at least 97 (0.2%) individuals would harbor a potentially pathogenic mutation in KCNQ1, which is more prevalent than expected on the basis of current medical literature (p = 0.0004). KCNQ1 variant penetrance was estimated to be only 9% to 17%. Identifying the importance of large genomic studies, our study demonstrates that 46% of pathogenic mutations in KCNQ1 had a population frequency of less than 1:50,000.; CONCLUSION: Screening a large database with genomic screening for a condition that is relevant to active duty service members results in the identification of many individuals with potentially pathogenic mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, which has profound implications for screening military or other adult cohorts in terms of over diagnosis, overtreatment, and increased medical resource usage. This study of KCNQ1 provides a platform for consideration of other genes that cause sudden cardiac death as well as other medically actionable hereditary disorders for which genomic screening is available. We review the potential benefits of genomic screening and also present the complex hurdles that will be encountered as such technologies unfold.

AB INTRODUCTION: Despite strong incentives to use cardiac rehabilitation (CR), patient participation is low in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This is paradoxical given that VHA is an integrated health care system that offers a range of CR programs which should logically reduce barriers to access to CR participation. The purpose of this study was to better understand the contextual factors that influence patient participation in CR and how patients consider factors together when making decisions about CR participation.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a qualitative study design we examined patient and provider perceptions of CR across six VHA medical centers with high- and low-enrollment rates between December 2014 and October 2015. We conducted semistructured interviews with CR eligible patients who had both enrolled and not enrolled in CR (n = 16), cardiology providers who could refer patients to CR and CR staff who provided CR services (n = 15). Data were analyzed using grounded thematic techniques.; RESULTS: We identified program and patient-specific factors related to CR participation. The four program factors were: program responsiveness to patient needs, CR schedule, specialized CR program equipment, and the CR program social environment. Program factors were primarily discussed by individuals associated with sites that had high CR enrollment rates. The patient-specific factor that promoted participation was patient perceptions of CR benefits. Disincentives to participation included competing conditions or obligations, logistical/cost challenges, convenience, and fear of exercise. CR participation entailed a complex process in which patients balanced factors that reinforced patient perceptions that CR was beneficial against factors that acted as disincentives to participation.; CONCLUSIONS: CR participation was influenced by both program and patient factors. Patients weighed factors that fostered perceptions that CR was beneficial against factors that served as disincentives to CR participation when considering CR participation. High-enrollment sites may be better at countering disincentives to participate and/or improve patient perceptions of CR. Actionable ways to improve CR participation include encouraging providers to strongly and frequently endorse CR, educating patients about the importance and benefits of CR, emphasizing how exercises are individualized, supervised and monitored, educating patients about how CR is safe and effective, how CR offers peer support, and structuring CR programs to be responsive to patient needs in terms of duration, frequency, schedule, and location.

AB Current therapies for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant childhood brain tumour, impose debilitating effects on the developing child, and highlight the need for molecularly targeted treatments with reduced toxicity. Previous studies have been unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking' events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma.

AB Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains an incurable disease. Two recurrent cytogenetic aberrations, namely del(17p), affecting TP53, and del(11q), affecting ATM, are associated with resistance against genotoxic chemotherapy (del17p) and poor outcome (del11q and del17p). Both del(17p) and del(11q) are also associated with inferior outcome to the novel targeted agents, such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Thus, even in the era of targeted therapies, CLL with alterations in the ATM/p53 pathway remains a clinical challenge. Here we generated two mouse models of Atm- and Trp53-deficient CLL. These animals display a significantly earlier disease onset and reduced overall survival, compared to controls. We employed these models in conjunction with transcriptome analyses following cyclophosphamide treatment to reveal that Atm deficiency is associated with an exquisite and genotype-specific sensitivity against PARP inhibition. Thus, we generate two aggressive CLL models and provide a preclinical rational for the use of PARP inhibitors in ATM-affected human CLL.ATM and TP53 mutations are associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Here the authors generate mouse models of Tp53- and Atm-defective CLL mimicking the high-risk form of human disease and show that Atm-deficient CLL is sensitive to PARP1 inhibition.

AB Chordoma is a malignant, often incurable bone tumour showing notochordal differentiation. Here, we defined the somatic driver landscape of 104 cases of sporadic chordoma. We reveal somatic duplications of the notochordal transcription factor brachyury (T) in up to 27% of cases. These variants recapitulate the rearrangement architecture of the pathogenic germline duplications of T that underlie familial chordoma. In addition, we find potentially clinically actionable PI3K signalling mutations in 16% of cases. Intriguingly, one of the most frequently altered genes, mutated exclusively by inactivating mutation, was LYST (10%), which may represent a novel cancer gene in chordoma.Chordoma is a rare often incurable malignant bone tumour. Here, the authors investigate driver mutations of sporadic chordoma in 104 cases, revealing duplications in notochordal transcription factor brachyury (T), PI3K signalling mutations, and mutations in LYST, a potential novel cancer gene in chordoma.

AB Androgen deprivation (AD) therapy failure leads to terminal and incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We show that the redox-protective protein thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) increases with prostate cancer progression and in androgen-deprived CRPC cells, suggesting that CRPC possesses an enhanced dependency on TRX1. TRX1 inhibition via shRNA or a phase I-approved inhibitor, PX-12 (untested in prostate cancer), impedes the growth of CRPC cells to a greater extent than their androgen-dependent counterparts. TRX1 inhibition elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 levels and cell death in androgen-deprived CRPC cells. Unexpectedly, TRX1 inhibition also elevates androgen receptor (AR) levels under AD, and AR depletion mitigates both TRX1 inhibition-mediated ROS production and cell death, suggesting that AD-resistant AR expression in CRPC induces redox vulnerability. In vivo TRX1 inhibition via shRNA or PX-12 reverses the castration-resistant phenotype of CRPC cells, significantly inhibiting tumor formation under systemic AD. Thus, TRX1 is an actionable CRPC therapeutic target through its protection against AR-induced redox stress.

AB Accurate detection of genomic alterations using high-throughput sequencing is an essential component of precision cancer medicine. We characterize the variant allele fractions (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide variants and indels across 5095 clinical samples profiled using a custom panel, CancerSCAN. Our results demonstrate that a significant fraction of clinically actionable variants have low VAFs, often due to low tumor purity and treatment-induced mutations. The percentages of mutations under 5% VAF across hotspots in EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF are 16%, 11%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, with 24% for EGFR T790M and 17% for PIK3CA E545. For clinical relevance, we describe two patients for whom targeted therapy achieved remission despite low VAF mutations. We also characterize the read depths necessary to achieve sensitivity and specificity comparable to current laboratory assays. These results show that capturing low VAF mutations at hotspots by sufficient sequencing coverage and carefully tuned algorithms is imperative for a clinical assay.

AB Large-scale genomic analyses of human cancers have cataloged somatic point mutations thought to initiate tumor development and sustain cancer growth. However, determining the functional significance of specific alterations remains a major bottleneck in our understanding of the genetic determinants of cancer. Here, we present a platform that integrates multiplexed AAV/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) with DNA barcoding and high-throughput sequencing to simultaneously investigate multiple genomic alterations in de novo cancers in mice. Using this approach, we introduce a barcoded library of non-synonymous mutations into hotspot codons 12 and 13 of Kras in adult somatic cells to initiate tumors in the lung, pancreas, and muscle. High-throughput sequencing of barcoded Kras HDR alleles from bulk lung and pancreas reveals surprising diversity in Kras variant oncogenicity. Rapid, cost-effective, and quantitative approaches to simultaneously investigate the function of precise genomic alterations in vivo will help uncover novel biological and clinically actionable insights into carcinogenesis.

AB Neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant accumulation of undigested cellular components represent unmet medical conditions for which the identification of actionable targets is urgently needed. Here we identify a pharmacologically actionable pathway that controls cellular clearance via Akt modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathways. We show that Akt phosphorylates TFEB at Ser467 and represses TFEB nuclear translocation independently of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a known TFEB inhibitor. The autophagy enhancer trehalose activates TFEB by diminishing Akt activity. Administration of trehalose to a mouse model of Batten disease, a prototypical neurodegenerative disease presenting with intralysosomal storage, enhances clearance of proteolipid aggregates, reduces neuropathology and prolongs survival of diseased mice. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt promotes cellular clearance in cells from patients with a variety of lysosomal diseases, thus suggesting broad applicability of this approach. These findings open new perspectives for the clinical translation of TFEB-mediated enhancement of cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage diseases.

AB The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial signaling node that integrates environmental cues to regulate cell survival, proliferation and metabolism, and is often deregulated in human cancer. mTOR kinase acts in two functionally distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), whose activities and substrate specificities are regulated by complex co-factors. Deregulation of this centralized signaling pathway has been associated with a variety of human diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer. Although mTORC1 signaling has been extensively studied in cancer, recent discoveries indicate a subset of human cancers harboring amplifications in mTORC2-specific genes as the only actionable genomic alterations, suggesting a distinct role for mTORC2 in cancer as well. This review will summarize recent advances in dissecting the relative contributions of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 in cancer, their role in tumor-associated blood vessels and tumor immunity, and provide an update on mTOR inhibitors.

AB There remains a large discrepancy between the known genetic contributions to cancer and that which can be explained by genomic variants, both inherited and somatic. Recently, understudied repetitive DNA regions called microsatellites have been identified as genetic risk markers for a number of diseases including various cancers (breast, ovarian and brain). In this study, we demonstrate an integrated process for identifying and further evaluating microsatellite-based risk markers for lung cancer using data from the cancer genome atlas and the 1000 genomes project. Comparing whole-exome germline sequencing data from 488 TCGA lung cancer samples to germline exome data from 390 control samples from the 1000 genomes project, we identified 119 potentially informative microsatellite loci. These loci were found to be able to distinguish between cancer and control samples with sensitivity and specificity ratios over 0.8. Then these loci, supplemented with additional loci from other cancers and controls, were evaluated using a target enrichment kit and sample-multiplexed nextgen sequencing. Thirteen of the 119 risk markers were found to be informative in a well powered study (>0.99 for a 0.95 confidence interval) using high-depth (579x±315) nextgen sequencing of 30 lung cancer and 89 control samples, resulting in sensitivity and specificity ratios of 0.90 and 0.94, respectively. When 8 loci harvested from the bioinformatic analysis of other cancers are added to the classifier, then the sensitivity and specificity rise to 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. Analysis of the genes harboring these loci revealed two genes (ARID1B and REL) and two significantly enriched pathways (chromatin organization and cellular stress response) suggesting that the process of lung carcinogenesis is linked to chromatin remodeling, inflammation, and tumor microenvironment restructuring. We illustrate that high-depth sequencing enables a high-precision microsatellite-based risk classifier analysis approach. This microsatellite-based platform confirms the potential to create clinically actionable diagnostics for lung cancer.

AB The hypoxic response underlies the pathogenesis and malignant behavior of PCC/PGL. Regulation of PD-1 receptor-ligand signaling, a therapeutically actionable driver of the anti-tumor immune response, is a hypoxic-driven trait across malignancies. We evaluated the prognostic role of PD ligands in association with biomarkers of hypoxia and angiogenesis in patients with PCC/PGL. Tissue microarrays sections including consecutive cases diagnosed between 1983-2011 were stained for PD-L1 and 2, hypoxia inducible factor 1a (Hif-1a), Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CaIX), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A). We explored the biologic significance of PD ligands expression using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for PCC/PGL (n = 184). In total, 100 patients, 10% malignant, 64% PCC, 29% familial with median tumor size of 4.7cm (range 1-14) were included. Median follow-up was 4.7y. We found PD-L1 expression in 18% of PCC/PGL, which was independent of adverse pathological features including capsular (CI), vascular invasion (VI), necrosis (N) and expression of biomarkers of hypoxia. PD-L2 expression (16%) strongly correlated with CI, VI, N and malignant behavior (p < 0.05) and was associated with stronger Hif-1a and CaIX immunolabeling (p < 0.01). PD-L2 was predictive of shorter survival (162 versus 309months, HR 3.1 95%CI 1.1-9.2, p = 0.02). GSEA on TGCA samples confirmed enrichment of transcripts involved in hypoxia and anti-cancer immunity. We report for the first time PD ligands expression in PCC/PGL with a distinctive prognostic, clinico-pathologic and immuno-biologic role. These findings support a potential therapeutic role for PD-1/PD-L1 targeted checkpoint inhibitors in these tumors. KEY MESSAGE The molecular mechanisms underlying immune evasion in malignant phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCC/PGL) are poorly understood. This study demonstrates for the first time a distinctive immune-biologic and prognostic role of programmed death ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1, PD-L2), two actionable drivers of the anti-cancer immune response. RNA-sequencing of tumor tissues reveals enrichment of transcripts relating to hypoxia and immune-exhaustion to explain the adverse clinical course observed in PD-L2 overexpressing tumors. These findings provide a rationale for the development of anti PD-1 therapies in malignant PCC/PGL.

AB BACKGROUND: Angiosarcomas (AS) are rare in humans, but they are a deadly subtype of soft tissue sarcoma. Discovery sequencing in AS, especially the visceral form, is hampered by the rarity of cases. Most diagnostic material exists as archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue which serves as a poor source of high quality DNA for genome-wide sequencing. We approached this problem through comparative genomics. We hypothesized that exome sequencing a histologically similar tumor, hemangiosarcoma (HSA), that occurs in approximately 50,000 dogs per year, may lead to the identification of potential oncogenic drivers and druggable targets that could also occur in angiosarcoma.; METHODS: Splenic hemangiosarcomas are common in dogs, which allowed us to collect a cohort of archived matched tumor and normal tissue samples suitable for whole exome sequencing. Mapping of the reads to the latest canine reference genome (Canfam3) demonstrated that >99% of the targeted exomal regions were covered, with >80% at 20X coverage and >90% at 10X coverage.; RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sequence analysis of 20 samples identified somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, and PLCG1, all of which correspond to well-known tumor drivers in human cancer, in more than half of the cases. In one case, we identified a mutation in PLCG1 identical to a mutation observed previously in this gene in human visceral AS. Activating PIK3CA mutations present novel therapeutic targets, and clinical trials of targeted inhibitors are underway in human cancers. Our results lay a foundation for similar clinical trials in canine HSA, enabling a precision medicine approach to this disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) is a landmark imaging and omics study in AD. ADNI research literature has increased substantially over the past decade, which poses challenges for effectively communicating information about the results and impact of ADNI-related studies. In this work, we employed advanced information visualization techniques to perform a comprehensive and systematic mapping of the ADNI scientific growth and impact over a period of 12 years.; METHODS: Citation information of ADNI-related publications from 01/01/2003 to 05/12/2015 were downloaded from the Scopus database. Five fields, including authors, years, affiliations, sources (journals), and keywords, were extracted and preprocessed. Statistical analyses were performed on basic publication data as well as journal and citations information. Science mapping workflows were conducted using the Science of Science (Sci2) Tool to generate geospatial, topical, and collaboration visualizations at the micro (individual) to macro (global) levels such as geospatial layouts of institutional collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence networks, and author collaboration networks evolving over time.; RESULTS: During the studied period, 996 ADNI manuscripts were published across 233 journals and conference proceedings. The number of publications grew linearly from 2008 to 2015, so did the number of involved institutions. ADNI publications received much more citations than typical papers from the same set of journals. Collaborations were visualized at multiple levels, including authors, institutions, and research areas. The evolution of key ADNI research topics was also plotted over the studied period.; CONCLUSIONS: Both statistical and visualization results demonstrate the increasing attention of ADNI research, strong citation impact of ADNI publications, the expanding collaboration networks among researchers, institutions and ADNI core areas, and the dynamic evolution of ADNI research topics. The visualizations presented here can help improve daily decision making based on a deep understanding of existing patterns and trends using proven and replicable data analysis and visualization methods. They have great potential to provide new insights and actionable knowledge for helping translational research in AD.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays have provided a new method of identifying tumor-driving genes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), especially in those whose cancer tissues are unavailable or in those that have acquired treatment resistance. Here, we describe a total of 119 patients with advanced EGFR-TKI-naive NSCLC and 15 EGFR-TKI-resistant patients to identify somatic SNVs, small indels, CNVs and gene fusions in 508 tumor-related genes. Somatic ctDNA mutations were detected in 82.8% (111/134) of patients in the total cohort. Of the 119 patients with advanced NSCLC, 27.7% (33/119) were suitable for treatment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline-approved targeted drugs. Actionable genetic alterations included 25 EGFR mutations, 5 BRAF mutations, and 1 MET mutation, as well as 1 EML4-ALK gene fusion and 1 KIF5B-RET gene fusion. In 19.3% (23/119) of the patients, we also identified genomic alterations with that could be targeted by agents that are in clinical trials, such as mTOR inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Additionally, the EGFR T790M mutation was found in 46.7% (7/15) of the patients with EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC, suggesting that the NGS-based ctDNA assay might be an optional method to monitor EGFR-TKI resistance and to discover mechanisms of drug resistance.

AB BACKGROUND: Approximately 5 to 10% of critically ill patients transition from acute critical illness to a state of persistent and in some cases chronic critical illness. These patients have unique and complex needs that require a change in the clinical management plan and overall goals of care to a focus on rehabilitation, symptom relief, discharge planning, and in some cases, end-of-life care. However, existing indicators and measures of care quality, and tools such as checklists, that foster implementation of best practices, may not be sufficiently inclusive in terms of actionable processes of care relevant to these patients. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify the processes of care, performance measures, quality indicators, and outcomes including reports of patient/family experience described in the current evidence base relevant to patients with persistent or chronic critical illness and their family members.; METHODS: Two authors will independently search from inception to November 2016: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, the Joanna Briggs Institute and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We will include all study designs except case series/reports of <10 patients describing their study population (aged 18years and older) using terms such as persistent critical illness, chronic critical illness, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Two authors will independently perform data extraction and complete risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcome is to determine actionable processes of care and interventions deemed relevant to patients experiencing persistent or chronic critical illness and their family members. Secondary outcomes include (1) performance measures and quality indicators considered relevant to our population of interest and (2) themes related to patient and family experience.; DISCUSSION: We will use our systematic review findings, with data from patient, family member and clinician interviews, and a subsequent consensus building process to inform the development of quality metrics and tools to measure processes of care, outcomes and experience for patients experiencing persistent or chronic critical illness and their family members.; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42016052715.

AB Background: Synergistic combination antimicrobial therapy may provide new options for treatment of MDR infections. However, comprehensive in vitro synergy data are limited and facile methods to perform synergy testing in a clinically actionable time frame are unavailable.; Objectives: To systematically investigate a broad range of antibiotic combinations for evidence of synergistic activity against a collection of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates.; Methods: We made use of an automated method for chequerboard array synergy testing based on inkjet printer technology in the HP D300 digital dispenser to test 56 pairwise antimicrobial combinations of meropenem, aztreonam, cefepime, colistin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and rifampicin, as well as the double carbapenem combination of meropenem and ertapenem.; Results: In a screening procedure, we tested these combinations against four CRE strains and identified nine antibiotic combinations that showed potential clinically relevant synergy. In confirmatory testing using 10 CRE strains, six combinations demonstrated clinically relevant synergy with both antimicrobials at the minimum fractional inhibitory concentration (FICI-MIN) in the susceptible or intermediate range in at least one trial. These included two novel combinations: minocycline plus colistin and minocycline plus meropenem. In 80% of strains at least one combination demonstrated clinically relevant synergy, but the combinations that demonstrated synergy varied from strain to strain.; Conclusions: This work establishes the foundation for future systematic, broad-range investigations into antibiotic synergy for CRE, emphasizes the need for individualized synergy testing and demonstrates the utility of inkjet printer-based technology for the performance of automated antimicrobial synergy assays. © The Author 2017.

AB Policy Points: Strengthening accountability through better measurement and reporting is vital to ensure progress in improving quality primary health care (PHC) systems and achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) provides national decision makers and global stakeholders with opportunities to benchmark and accelerate performance improvement through better performance measurement. Results from the initial PHC performance assessments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are helping guide PHC reforms and investments and improve the PHCPI's instruments and indicators. Findings from future assessment activities will further amplify cross-country comparisons and peer learning to improve PHC. New indicators and sources of data are needed to better understand PHC system performance in LMICs.; CONTEXT: The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI), a collaboration between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The World Bank, and the World HealthOrganization, in partnership with Ariadne Labs and Results for Development, was launched in 2015 with the aim of catalyzing improvements in primary health care (PHC) systems in 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in order to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage. Through more comprehensive and actionable measurement of quality PHC, the PHCPI stimulates peer learning among LMICs and informs decision makers to guide PHC investments and reforms. Instruments for performance assessment and improvement are in development; to date, a conceptual framework and 2 sets of performance indicators have been released.; METHODS: The PHCPI team developed the conceptual framework through literature reviews and consultations with an advisory committee of international experts. We generated 2 sets of performance indicators selected from a literature review of relevant indicators, cross-referenced against indicators available from international sources, and evaluated through 2 separate modified Delphi processes, consisting of online surveys and in-person facilitated discussions with experts.; FINDINGS: The PHCPI conceptual framework builds on the current understanding of PHC system performance through an expanded emphasis on the role of service delivery. The first set of performance indicators, 36 Vital Signs, facilitates comparisons across countries and over time. The second set, 56 Diagnostic Indicators, elucidates underlying drivers of performance. Key challenges include a lack of available data for several indicators and a lack of validated indicators for important dimensions of quality PHC.; CONCLUSIONS: The availability of data is critical to assessing PHC performance, particularly patient experience and quality of care. The PHCPI will continue to develop and test additional performance assessment instruments, including composite indices and national performance dashboards. Through country engagement, the PHCPI will further refine its instruments and engage with governments to better design and finance primary health care reforms. © 2017 Milbank Memorial Fund.

AB Background: Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States among men and women, and it is the most common cause of cancer-related death. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. Historically, patients with metastatic NSCLC received similar cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Genotyping studies have revealed genetic/molecular abnormalities in lung cancer. These driver mutations render a cancer dependent on that specific mutation's biochemical pathway for its growth and survival. With the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibodies against specific driver mutations, the landscape of lung cancer treatment has changed from treatment based on histologic subtype to treatment based on molecularly defined subtypes.; Methods: In this article, we review the current molecular-targeted therapies in lung cancer.; Results: We review landmark trials that have led to approval of molecular-targeted therapies against epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and ROS1. We also explore less common mutations/molecular abnormalities and review data on the use of targeted therapies against them. Finally, we offer a treatment algorithm for patients with metastatic NSCLC that harbors actionable mutations.; Conclusion: Patients with advanced NSCLC should undergo mutational testing to evaluate for actionable mutations. If such a mutation is discovered, targeted therapy should be considered for first-line treatment.

AB Vaccine cold chain equipment (CCE) in developing countries is often exposed to harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures and humidity, and is subject to many additional challenges, including intermittent power supply, insufficient maintenance capacity, and a scarcity of replacement parts. Together, these challenges lead to high failure rates for refrigerators, potentially damaging vaccines and adversely affecting immunization coverage. Providing a sustainable solution for improving CCE performance requires an understanding of the root causes of failure. Project teams conducted small-scale studies to determine the root causes of CCE failure in selected locations in Uganda and Mozambique. The evaluations covered 59 failed refrigerators and freezers in Uganda and 27 refrigerators in Mozambique. In Uganda, the vast majority of failures were due to a cooling unit fault in one widely used refrigerator model. In Mozambique, 11 of the 27 problems were attributable to solar refrigerators with batteries that were unable to hold a charge, and another eight problems were associated with a need to adjust thermostat settings. The studies showed that tracking and evaluation of equipment performance and failure can yield important, actionable information for a range of stakeholders, including local CCE technicians, the ministry of health, equipment manufacturers, and international partners such as the United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Collaborative efforts to systematically collect and communicate data on CCE performance and causes of failure will help to improve the efficiency and reach of immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries.

AB BACKGROUND: There have been few large studies that have analyzed the effect of professional (masked) continuous glucose monitoring (P-CGM) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who were on a broad spectrum of baseline therapies.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective, blinded evaluation of glycemic control in 296 T2DM adults for 6months following a 6- to 7-day study of their glycemic profile using masked P-CGM. At baseline, 91% of the patients were on some form of insulin treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), while 7% were on one or more OHAs without insulin, and the remaining 2% were on GLP-1RAs. On the basis of the masked CGM profile, patients were counselled on diet and exercise change(s) in their baseline diabetes therapy by our professionally trained diabetes team. They also continued to receive regular treatment advice and dose titrations through our Diabetes Tele-Management System (DTMS). The baseline changes in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) observed in these patients after 6months of undergoing P-CGM was compared to a matched control group.; RESULTS: P-CGM revealed that the predominant pattern of hyperglycemia was postprandial while previously unknown hypoglycemia was found in 38% of the patients; over half of the cases of hypoglycemia were nocturnal. The mean A1C of the P-CGM group dropped from 7.5±1.4% at baseline vs. 7.0±0.9% at 6months (p<0.0001). The frequency of performing self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was also found to be significantly increased in these patients from the baseline. Meanwhile, no significant improvement in A1C was noted in the control group during the same time frame (7.7±1.1% at baseline vs. 7.4±1.1% at 6months; p=0.0663) and frequency of SMBG remained almost unchanged.; CONCLUSIONS: P-CGM can provide actionable data and motivate patients for diabetes self-care practices, resulting in an improvement in glycemic control over a wide range of baseline therapies.

AB In recognition that Iowa agriculture must maintain long-term production of food, fiber, clean water, healthy soil, and robust rural economies, Iowa recently devised a nutrient reduction strategy to set objectives for water quality improvements. To demonstrate how watershed programs and farmers can reduce nutrient and sediment pollution in Iowa waters, the Iowa Water Quality Initiative selected the Boone River Watershed Nutrient Management Initiative as one of eight demonstration projects. For over a decade, diverse public, private, and non-profit partner organizations have worked in the Boone River Watershed to engage farmers in water quality management efforts. To evaluate social dynamics in the Boone River Watershed and provide partners with actionable recommendations, we conducted and analyzed semi-structured interviews with 33 program leaders, farmers, and local agronomists. We triangulated primary interview data with formal analysis of Boone River Watershed documents such as grant applications, progress reports, and outreach materials. Our evaluation suggests that while multi-stakeholder collaboration has enabled partners to overcome many of the traditional barriers to watershed programming, scale mismatches caused by external socio-economic and ecological forces still present substantial obstacles to programmatic resilience. Public funding restrictions and timeframes, for example, often cause interruptions to adaptive management of water quality monitoring and farmer engagement. We present our findings within a resilience framework to demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaboration can help sustain adaptive watershed programs to improve socio-ecological function in agricultural watersheds such as the Boone River Watershed.

AB Genomic tests such as exome sequencing have recently become an option for diagnosing patients. The tests allow clinical geneticists to sequence the majority of patients' disease causing genetic variants. As a new technology, exome sequencing confronts the question of what the benefit is of this increased genetic information. Against a narrow perspective of clinical utility that emphasises tangible improvements in a patient's disease management, professional organisations have argued that genomic sequencing should be considered beneficial if it helps families and society. Based on video-recorded observations of the return of exome sequencing results to parents of a child with disabilities in the clinic and in-depth interviews with these parents, we examine how genomic test results become actionable in the clinical encounter. We find that parents and clinicians marshal exome results beyond biomedical diagnostic and management goals to address questions about guilt for causing the disabilities and to secure access to disability-related services. We argue that genomic actionability rests on the interaction between the biological characteristics of genetic results and the predicaments facing parents of children with disabilities. © 2017 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness.

AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The American Board of Radiology has adopted a new standardized board examination and the traditional oral examination has been abandoned. Although many programs have changed their educational efforts to reflect the new test format, some faculty members and residents have expressed a desire to keep an oral examination as a component of education and evaluation in radiology residency programs.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: An oral comprehensive examination including all the appropriate subspecialties was administered to each second year and third year resident in our training program by faculty members. Both the resident examinees and faculty examiners were surveyed after the examination to gauge the perceived value of the experience.; RESULTS: Residents were divided in their perceptions of the fairness and utility of an oral examination as a tool to aid in board preparation and as an assessment of their knowledge and communication skill. Faculty members were universal in their endorsement of the oral examination and suggested continued use of the technique.; CONCLUSIONS: Residents and faculty members have differing perceptions of an oral examination delivered during training to assess knowledge and communication skill. The value of an oral examination in providing actionable feedback to trainees and the possibility of detecting struggling residents made it useful in our training program, and it thus it has been implemented for future years. Whether resident performance measured by this technique is predictive of success on American Board of Radiology examinations remains unclear.

AB For more than a century, blood agar plates have been the only test for beta-hemolysis. Although blood agar cultures are highly predictive for bacterial pathogens, they are too slow to yield actionable information. Here, we show that beta-hemolytic pathogens are able to lyse and release fluorophores encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes whereas alpha and gamma-hemolytic bacteria have no effect. By analyzing fluorescence kinetics, beta-hemolytic colonies cultured on agar could be distinguished in real time with 100% accuracy within 6 h. Additionally, end point analysis based on fluorescence intensity and machine-extracted textural features could discriminate between beta-hemolytic and cocultured control colonies with 99% accuracy. In broth cultures, beta-hemolytic bacteria were detectable in under an hour while control bacteria remained negative even the next day. This strategy, called beta-hemolysis triggered-release assay (BETA) has the potential to enable the same-day detection of beta-hemolysis with single-cell sensitivity and high accuracy.

AB BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) underlie a substantial proportion of paediatric disease burden but their genetic diagnosis can be challenging using the traditional approaches.; METHODS: We designed and validated a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 226 IEM genes, created six overlapping phenotype-based subpanels and tested 102 individuals, who presented clinically with suspected childhood-onset IEMs.; RESULTS: In 51/102 individuals, NGS fully or partially established the molecular cause or identified other actionable diagnoses. Causal mutations were identified significantly more frequently when the biochemical phenotype suggested a specific IEM or a group of IEMs (p<0.0001), demonstrating the pivotal role of prior biochemical testing in guiding NGS analysis. The NGS panel helped to avoid further invasive, hazardous, lengthy or expensive investigations in 69% individuals (p<0.0001). Additional functional testing due to novel or unexpected findings had to be undertaken in only 3% of subjects, demonstrating that the use of NGS does not significantly increase the burden of subsequent follow-up testing. Even where a molecular diagnosis could not be achieved, NGS-based approach assisted in the management and counselling by reducing the likelihood of a high-penetrant genetic cause.; CONCLUSION: NGS has significant clinical utility for the diagnosis of IEMs. Biochemical testing and NGS analysis play complementary roles in the diagnosis of IEMs. Incorporating NGS into the diagnostic algorithm of IEMs can improve the accuracy of diagnosis. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

AB Pharmacogenomics is a fast-growing field of personalized medicine using a patient's genomic profile to determine drug disposition or response to drug therapy, in order to develop safer and more effective pharmacotherapy. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), being the most common malignancy in childhood, which is treated with uniform and standardized clinical trials, is remarkably poised for pharmacogenomic studies. In the last decade, unbiased genome-wide association studies have identified multiple germline risk factors that strongly modify host response to drug therapy. Some of these genomic associations (e.g. TPMT, NUDT15 and mercaptopurine dosing) have accumulated a significant level of evidence on their clinical utility such that they are warranted as routine clinical tests to guide modification of treatment. Most of these germline associations however, have not yet reached such actionability. Insights have also been gathered on germline factors that affect host susceptibility to adverse effects of antileukemic agents (eg, vincristine, asparaginase, methotrexate). Further large-scale studies are required, along with the assimilation of both germline and somatic variants, to precisely predict host drug response and drug toxicities, with the eventual aim of executing genomic-based precision-pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ALL.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive techniques, including endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), yield small specimens that are adequate for cytologic diagnosis of lung cancer, but also need to provide material for molecular analysis to guide treatment. The number of EBUS-TBNA passes needed for mutation testing remains unclear. We sought to assess the adequacy of a single pass for genomic profiling of actionable mutations.; METHODS: In a prospective observational study, paired samples from the same lesion were obtained from patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA for lung cancer diagnosis/staging. Following tumor cell confirmation by rapid on-site evaluation, a "reference" sample comprising≥ 3 passes was obtained and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. A "study" sample comprising a single pass was taken and snap-frozen. The primary outcome was DNA yield and quality from a single pass. The secondary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of a single pass for detecting actionable mutations.; RESULTS: In 40 patients, single-pass specimens yielded a mean 3.98 mug of highly intact DNA, well above the minimum threshold for targeted sequencing, which was performed in adenocarcinoma cases (n= 24). In 23 cases, there was 100% agreement in mutation status between reference and study samples. In 1 case, the reference sample failed to generate a molecular diagnosis owing to insufficient tumor cells; however, the study specimen identified a KRAS mutation. Tumor cell percentage in mutation-positive specimens was 1% to 70%, suggesting that single-pass samples detect mutations even when tumor cell content is low.; CONCLUSION: Single EBUS-TBNA passes yield DNA of high quantity and quality with high accuracy for molecular profiling, irrespective of tumor cell content.

AB Recently, large sequencing studies have provided insights into the mutational landscape of multiple myeloma (MM), identifying actionable mutations and giving a precious opportunity for exploring new targeted therapies. The main goal of precision medicine, matching patients with the right drug, seems to be closer than ever. However, no targeted therapies in MM are approved yet. Several clinical trials testing targeted drugs and enrolling patients with MM are currently ongoing and will provide predictive biomarkers that might support clinical decision making. In this review, we evaluate the evidence supporting the implementation of precision medicine in MM and we discuss the challenges that should be dealt with in this imminent and promising new era.

AB INTRODUCTION: Hematological malignancies originate and progress in primary and secondary lymphoid organs, where they establish a uniquely immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Although high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approaches are being employed to interrogate immune surveillance and escape mechanisms in patients with solid tumours, and to identify actionable targets for immunotherapy, our knowledge of the immunological landscape of hematological malignancies, as well as our understanding of the molecular circuits that underpin the establishment of immune tolerance, is not comprehensive. Areas covered: This article will discuss how multiplexed immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry/mass cytometry, proteomic and genomic techniques can be used to dynamically capture the complexity of tumour-immune interactions. Moreover, the analysis of multi-dimensional, clinically annotated data sets obtained from public repositories such as Array Express, TCGA and GEO is crucial to identify immune biomarkers, to inform the rational design of immune therapies and to predict clinical benefit in individual patients. We will also highlight how artificial neural network models and alternative methodologies integrating other algorithms can support the identification of key molecular drivers of immune dysfunction. Expert commentary: High-dimensional technologies have the potential to enhance our understanding of immune-cancer interactions and will support clinical decision making and the prediction of therapeutic benefit from immune-based interventions.

AB PurposeWe investigated the diagnostic and clinical performance of exome sequencing in fetuses with sonographic abnormalities with normal karyotype and microarray and, in some cases, normal gene-specific sequencing.MethodsExome sequencing was performed on DNA from 15 anomalous fetuses and from the peripheral blood of their parents. Parents provided consent to be informed of diagnostic results in the fetus, medically actionable findings in the parents, and their identification as carrier couples for significant autosomal recessive conditions. We assessed the perceptions and understanding of exome sequencing using mixed methods in 15 mother-father dyads.ResultsIn seven (47%) of 15 fetuses, exome sequencing provided a diagnosis or possible diagnosis with identification of variants in the following genes: COL1A1, MUSK, KCTD1, RTTN, TMEM67, PIEZO1 and DYNC2H1. One additional case revealed a de novo nonsense mutation in a novel candidate gene (MAP4K4). The perceived likelihood that exome sequencing would explain the results (5.2 on a 10-point scale) was higher than the approximately 30% diagnostic yield discussed in pretest counseling.ConclusionExome sequencing had diagnostic utility in a highly select population of fetuses where a genetic diagnosis was highly suspected. Challenges related to genetics literacy and variant interpretation must be addressed by highly tailored pre- and posttest genetic counseling.

AB Obtaining accurate drug response data in large cohorts of cancer patients is very challenging; thus, most cancer pharmacogenomics discovery is conducted in preclinical studies, typically using cell lines and mouse models. However, these platforms suffer from serious limitations, including small sample sizes. Here, we have developed a novel computational method that allows us to impute drug response in very large clinical cancer genomics data sets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The approach works by creating statistical models relating gene expression to drug response in large panels of cancer cell lines and applying these models to tumor gene expression data in the clinical data sets (e.g., TCGA). This yields an imputed drug response for every drug in each patient. These imputed drug response data are then associated with somatic genetic variants measured in the clinical cohort, such as copy number changes or mutations in protein coding genes. These analyses recapitulated drug associations for known clinically actionable somatic genetic alterations and identified new predictive biomarkers for existing drugs. © 2017 Geeleher et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB BACKGROUND: The decision to undergo laryngectomy carries medical, social, and emotional consequences. This study evaluates the understandability and actionability of current laryngectomy information.; METHODS: Laryngectomy-related educational materials from an online search were evaluated using the validated Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Reading difficulty was calculated using the Flesch-Kincaid Level, Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning-Fog Index (GFI), Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) score. Interrater agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship among readability, understandability, and actionability.; RESULTS: Forty-four articles were included. Interrater agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.71). Mean understandability was 68.3% ± 17% and mean actionability was 66.3% ± 24%. Average reading difficulty exceeded the ability of an average American adult. There was a negative correlation between readability and understandability (R = -0.49; P < .05).; CONCLUSION: Most laryngectomy information is too difficult for the average person to read, understand, or act upon. Revisions may be warranted to benefit a larger readership. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of lung is a rare tumor that is mostly reported in south-east Asian countries. The surgical removal is curative in the early stages but there is no consensus on the choice of chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced stage tumors. Most of the data on chemotherapy are based on small case series and retrospective studies. As per available data, this tumor responds to chemotherapy initially but recurrences are common. The use of conventional chemotherapy in recurrent tumors leads to cumulative toxicities in the long term. Due to lack of actionable mutations, targeted therapies are also not very useful. Immune check point inhibitors immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown survival benefit in patients with advanced stage non-small-cell and small cell carcinoma with better side effect profile than conventional chemotherapy. The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in LELC is unknown. Though several studies have reported high expression of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/or its -ligand (PD-L1) in LELC providing a rationale for trial of these agents, the actual benefit of these agents in LELC has not been reported so far. In this case series, we report two cases of advanced stage LELC that progressed despite multiple lines of chemotherapy but responded favorably to a PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab.

AB BACKGROUND: The addition of Global Positioning System (GPS) to a mobile phone makes it a very powerful tool for surveillance and monitoring coverage of health programs. This technology enables transfer of data directly into computer applications and cross-references to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps, which enhances assessment of coverage and trends.; OBJECTIVE: Utilization of these systems in low and middle income countries is currently limited, particularly for immunization coverage assessments and polio vaccination campaigns. We piloted the use of this system and discussed its potential to improve the efficiency of field-based health providers and health managers for monitoring of the immunization program.; METHODS: Using "30*7" WHO sampling technique, a survey of children less than five years of age was conducted in random clusters of Karachi, Pakistan in three high risk towns where a polio case was detected in 2011. Center point of the cluster was calculated by the application on the mobile. Data and location coordinates were collected through a mobile phone. This data was linked with an automated mHealth based monitoring system for monitoring of Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in Karachi. After each SIA, a visual report was generated according to the coordinates collected from the survey.; RESULT: A total of 3535 participants consented to answer to a baseline survey. We found that the mobile phones incorporated with GIS maps can improve efficiency of health providers through real-time reporting and replacing paper based questionnaire for collection of data at household level. Visual maps generated from the data and geospatial analysis can also give a better assessment of the immunization coverage and polio vaccination campaigns.; CONCLUSION: The study supports a model system in resource constrained settings that allows routine capture of individual level data through GPS enabled mobile phone providing actionable information and geospatial maps to local public health managers, policy makers and study staff monitoring immunization coverage.

AB PURPOSE: The advent of multigene panels has increased genetic testing options for women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We designed a decision model to compare costs and probabilities of identifying a deleterious mutation or variant of uncertain significance (VUS) using different genetic testing strategies.; METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of two testing strategies for women with EOC: multigene testing (MGT) versus single-gene testing for BRCA1/2. Outcomes were mean cost and number of deleterious mutations and VUSs identified. Model inputs were obtained from published genetic testing data in EOC. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.; RESULTS: No family history model: MGT cost $1,160 more on average than BRCA1/2 testing and identified an additional 3.8 deleterious mutations for every 100 women tested. For each additional deleterious mutation identified, MGT cost $30,812 and identified 5.4 additional VUSs. Family history model: MGT cost $654 more on average and identified an additional 7.0 deleterious mutations for every 100 women tested. For each additional deleterious mutation identified, MGT cost $9,909 and identified 2.6 additional VUSs.; CONCLUSION: MGT was associated with a higher additional cost per deleterious mutation identified and a higher ratio of VUS burden to actionable information in women with no family history as compared with women with a family history. Family history should be considered when determining an initial genetic testing platform in women with EOC.

AB The uncontrolled growth of tumors provides metabolic dependencies that can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit. Although tumor cells exhibit these increased metabolic demands due to their rapid proliferation, these metabolic processes are general to all cells, and furthermore, targeted therapeutic intervention can provoke compensatory adaptation that alters tumors' characteristics. As an example, a subset of melanomas depends on the transcriptional coactivator PGC1alpha function to sustain their mitochondrial energy-dependent survival. However, selective outgrowth of resistant PGC1alpha-independent tumor cells becomes endowed with an augmented metastatic phenotype. To find PGC1alpha-dependent components that would not affect metastasis in melanomas, an unbiased proteomic analyses was performed and uncovered the orphan nuclear receptor ERRalpha, which supports PGC1alpha's control of mitochondrial energetic metabolism, but does not affect the antioxidant nor antimetastatic regulatory roles. Specifically, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of ERRalpha reduces the inherent bioenergetic capacity and decreases melanoma cell growth, but without altering the invasive characteristics. Thus, within this particularly aggressive subset of melanomas, which is characterized by heighted expression of PGC1alpha, ERRalpha specifically mediates prosurvival functions and represents a tangible therapeutic target.Implications: ERRalpha, a druggable protein, mediates the bioenergetic effects in melanomas defined by high PGC1alpha expression, suggesting a rational means for therapeutic targeting of this particularly aggressive melanoma subtype.

AB Health communication is an essential health promotion strategy to convert scientific findings into actionable, empowering information for the public. Health communication interventions have shown positive outcomes, but many efforts have been disappointing. A key weakness is that expert-designed health communication is often overly generic and not adequately aligned with the abilities, preferences and life situations of specific audiences. The emergence of the field of health literacy is providing powerful theoretical guidance and practice strategies. Health literacy, in concert with other determinants of health, has greatly advanced understanding of factors that facilitate or hinder health promotion at individual, organizational and community settings. However, health literacy models are incomplete and interventions have shown only modest success to date. A challenge is to move beyond the current focus on individual comprehension and address deeper factors of motivation, self-efficacy and empowerment, as well as socio-environmental influences, and their impact to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities. Integrating participatory design theory and methods drawn from social sciences and design sciences can significantly improve health literacy models and interventions. Likewise, researchers and practitioners using participatory design can greatly benefit from incorporating health literacy principles into their efforts. Such interventions at multiple levels are showing positive health outcomes and reduction of health disparities, but this approach is complex and not yet widespread. This chapter focuses on research findings about health literacy and participatory design to improve health promotion, and practical guidance and case examples for researchers, practitioners and policymakers.

AB Precision Cancer Medicine: Tumors are classified into several molecular subtypes by Genomic Sequencing. Comprehensive targeted-gene panel provides more therapeutic options. CANCERPLEX-JP version 4.0 includes 435 actionable genes, which clinical approaches are available. Utilizing the gene panel platform, we assessed the genes and pathways most frequently altered in Japanese and US cases (Genome Med 2016;8:136). We demonstrate concordance of CANCERPLEX-JP with whole-exome sequencing from the TCGA in identifying hypermutated samples and microsatellite instability in multiple cancer types, such as colorectal and gastric cancer. We introduced our activity for precision medicine at 4th US-Japan Clinical Trials in Oncology Workshop sponsored by Embassy of Japan, at Washington DC, held in June 9, 2016. We highlight the clinical utility of CANCERPLEX-JP (435 genes) in guiding treatment strategies with targeted therapy in solid tumors, thus providing rationale for Comprehensive Genomic Sequencing in actualizing precision medicine. The goal of Precision Medicine is cost effectiveness and realization of genome drug discovery.Super-computing System: This introduction plan is based on the massive medical big data (cancer gene mutation information, genomic data, image data, etc.) possessed by Niigata Prefecture and Niigata University, to construct an integrated analysis system incorporating deep learning, and introduces a high-performance computer system for the development and activation of related industries. Therefore, it is necessary to have an operation system that can connect to the hospital electronic medical record without interference.(Presented at the 1943rd Meeting, July 5, 2017).

AB New alternative market models are needed to incentivize companies to invest in developing new antibacterial drugs. In a previous publication, the Transatlantic Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR) summarized the key areas of consensus for economic incentives for antibacterial drug development. That work determined that there was substantial agreement on the need for a mixture of push and pull incentives and particularly those that served to delink the revenues from the volumes sold. Pull incentives reward successful development by increasing or ensuring future revenue. Several pull incentives have been proposed that could substantially reward the development of new antibacterial drugs. In this second article authored by representatives of TATFAR, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different pull incentives for antibacterial drug development. It is TATFAR's hope that this analysis, combined with other related analyses, will provide actionable information that will shape policy makers' thinking on this important issue.

AB Precision genomic oncology-applying high throughput sequencing (HTS) at the point-of-care to inform clinical decisions-is a developing precision medicine paradigm that is seeing increasing adoption. Simultaneously, new developments in targeted agents and immunotherapy, when informed by rich genomic characterization, offer potential benefit to a growing subset of patients. Multiple previous studies have commented on methods for identifying both germline and somatic variants. However, interpreting individual variants remains a significant challenge, relying in large part on the integration of observed variants with biological knowledge. A number of data and software resources have been developed to assist in interpreting observed variants, determining their potential clinical actionability, and augmenting them with ancillary information that can inform clinical decisions and even generate new hypotheses for exploration in the laboratory. Here, we review available variant catalogs, variant and functional annotation software and tools, and databases of clinically actionable variants that can be used in an ad hoc approach with research samples or incorporated into a data platform for interpreting and formally reporting clinical results.

AB In the current era of molecularly targeted therapies and precision medicine, choice of cancer treatment has been increasingly tailored according to the molecular or genomic characterization of the cancer the individual has. Previously, the clinical observation of inadequate control of brain metastases was widely attributed to a lack of central nervous system (CNS) penetration of the anticancer drugs. However, more recent data have suggested that there are genetic explanations for such observations. Genomic analyses of brain metastases and matching primary tumor and other extracranial metastases have revealed that brain metastases can harbor potentially actionable driver mutations that are unique to them. Identification of genomic alterations specific to brain metastases and targeted therapies against these mutations represent an important research area to potentially improve survival outcomes for patients who develop brain metastases. Novel approaches in genomic testing such as that using cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) facilitate advancing our understanding of the genomics of brain metastases, which is critical for precision medicine. CSF-derived ctDNA sequencing may be particularly useful in patients who are unfit for surgical resection or have multiple brain metastases, which can harbor mutations that are distinct from their primary tumors. Compared to the traditional chemotherapeutics, novel targeted agents appear to be more effective in controlling the CNS disease with better safety profiles. Several brain metastases-dedicated trials of various targeted therapies are currently underway to address the role of these agents in the treatment of CNS disease. This review focuses on recent advances in genomic profiling of brain metastases and current knowledge of targeted therapies in the management of brain metastases from cancers of the breast, lung, colorectum, kidneys, and ovaries as well as melanoma.

AB Though phenotypic and target-based high-throughput screening approaches have been employed to discover new antibiotics, the identification of promising therapeutic candidates remains challenging. Each approach provides different information, and understanding their results can provide hypotheses for a mechanism of action (MoA) and reveal actionable chemical matter. Here, we describe a framework for identifying efficacy targets of bioactive compounds. High throughput biophysical profiling against a broad range of targets coupled with machine learning was employed to identify chemical features with predicted efficacy targets for a given phenotypic screen. We validate the approach on data from a set of 55 000 compounds in 24 historical internal antibacterial phenotypic screens and 636 bacterial targets screened in high-throughput biophysical binding assays. Models were built to reveal the relationships between phenotype, target, and chemotype, which recapitulated mechanisms for known antibacterials. We also prospectively identified novel inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase with nanomolar antibacterial efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Molecular modeling provided structural insight into target-ligand interactions underlying selective killing activity toward mycobacteria over human cells.

AB BACKGROUND: In 2008, the Institute of Medicine released a letter report identifying 4 research priority areas for public health emergency preparedness in public health system research: (1) enhancing the usefulness of training, (2) improving timely emergency communications, (3) creating and maintaining sustainable response systems, and (4) generating effectiveness criteria and metrics.; OBJECTIVES: To (1) identify and characterize public health system research in public health emergency preparedness produced in the United States from 2009 to 2015, (2) synthesize research findings and assess the level of confidence in these findings, and (3) describe the evolution of knowledge production in public health emergency preparedness system research. Search Methods and Selection Criteria. We reviewed and included the titles and abstracts of 1584 articles derived from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and gray literature databases that focused on the organizational or financial aspects of public health emergency preparedness activities and were grounded on empirical studies.; DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We included 156 articles. We appraised the quality of the studies according to the study design. We identified themes during article analysis and summarized overall findings by theme. We determined level of confidence in the findings with the GRADE-CERQual tool.; MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one studies provided evidence on how to enhance the usefulness of training. Results demonstrated the utility of drills and exercises to enhance decision-making capabilities and coordination across organizations, the benefit of cross-sector partnerships for successfully implementing training activities, and the value of integrating evaluation methods to support training improvement efforts. Thirty-six studies provided evidence on how to improve timely communications. Results supported the use of communication strategies that address differences in access to information, knowledge, attitudes, and practices across segments of the population as well as evidence on specific communication barriers experienced by public health and health care personnel. Forty-eight studies provided evidence on how to create and sustain preparedness systems. Results included how to build social capital across organizations and citizens and how to develop sustainable and useful planning efforts that maintain flexibility and rely on available medical data. Twenty-six studies provided evidence on the usefulness of measurement efforts, such as community and organizational needs assessments, and new methods to learn from the response to critical incidents.; CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, the field of public health emergency preparedness system research has been supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the release of the 2008 Institute of Medicine letter report. The first definition of public health emergency preparedness appeared in 2007, and before 2008 there was a lack of research and empirical evidence across all 4 research areas identified by the Institute of Medicine. This field can be considered relatively new compared with other research areas in public health; for example, tobacco control research can rely on more than 70 years of knowledge production. However, this review demonstrates that, during the past 7 years, public health emergency preparedness system research has evolved from generic inquiry to the analysis of specific interventions with more empirical studies. Public Health Implications: The results of this review provide an evidence base for public health practitioners responsible for enhancing key components of preparedness and response such as communication, training, and planning efforts.

AB Cancer cells frequently possess extra amplified centrosomes clustered into two poles whose pseudo-bipolar spindles exhibit reduced fidelity of chromosome segregation and promote genetic instability. Inhibition of centrosome clustering triggers multipolar spindle formation and mitotic catastrophe, offering an attractive therapeutic approach to selectively kill cells with amplified centrosomes. However, mechanisms of centrosome clustering remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new pathway that acts through NIMA-related kinase 6 (Nek6) and Hsp72 to promote centrosome clustering. Nek6, as well as its upstream activators polo-like kinase 1 and Aurora-A, targeted Hsp72 to the poles of cells with amplified centrosomes. Unlike some centrosome declustering agents, blocking Hsp72 or Nek6 function did not induce formation of acentrosomal poles, meaning that multipolar spindles were observable only in cells with amplified centrosomes. Inhibition of Hsp72 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells resulted in increased multipolar spindle frequency that correlated with centrosome amplification, while loss of Hsp72 or Nek6 function in noncancer-derived cells disturbs neither spindle formation nor mitotic progression. Hence, the Nek6-Hsp72 module represents a novel actionable pathway for selective targeting of cancer cells with amplified centrosomes.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient communication.; RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits.; SUMMARY: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

AB INTRODUCTION: Endothelin-1 receptor (ET-1R)/beta-arrestin1 (beta-arr1) signaling is dysregulated in ovarian cancer. This signaling circuit enables cancer cells to engage several signaling and transcriptional networks that are pervasively intertwined, and represent a potential therapeutic target for developing novel agents for ovarian cancer treatment. Areas covered: In this article, we discuss the role of the signaling network between ET-1R and key pathways mediated by the scaffold protein beta-arr1, as part of signaling complex, or as a transcription co-activator, promoting precise control of transcription of different genes, including ET-1. Therefore ET-1R/beta-arr1 is an actionable node involved in the activation of a persistent feedback loop that contributes to bypass signaling. Targeting ET-1R empowering this circuit can represent a necessary measure to reach clinical efficacy. Preclinical studies demonstrate that blocking ET-1R by FDA approved dual ETAR/ETBR antagonist prevents beta-arr1 network formation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy in ovarian cancer patients. Expert opinion: The information provided in this review about the ET-1R/beta-arr1 hub represents an invaluable tool for both identifying the interconnected pathways involved in ovarian cancer and targeting them more effectively. The new perspective arising from ET-1R therapeutics will likely prompt a valuable frame for the design of new promising combinatorial therapy, blocking compensatory networks.

AB The increasing use of genomics to define the pattern of actionable mutations and to test and validate new therapies for individual cancer patients, and the growing application of liquid biopsy to dynamically track tumor evolution and to adapt molecularly targeted therapy according to the emergence of tumor clonal variants is shaping modern medical oncology., In order to better describe this new therapeutic paradigm we propose the term "Liquid dynamic medicine" in the place of "Personalized or Precision medicine". Clinical validation of the "Liquid dynamic medicine" approach is best captured by N-of-1 trials where each patient acts as tester and control of truly personalized therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: Dietary modification is critical in the self-management of chronic kidney disease. The present study describes the accuracy, quality and health literacy demand of renal diet information for adults with kidney disease obtained from the Internet and YouTube (www.youtube.com).; METHODS: A comprehensive content analysis was undertaken in April and July 2015 of 254 eligible websites and 161 YouTube videos. The accuracy of the renal diet information was evaluated by comparing the key messages with relevant evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management of people with kidney disease. The DISCERN tool (www.discern.org.uk) was used to evaluate the quality of the material. Health literacy demand was evaluated using the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (www.ahrq.gov/professionals/prevention-chronic-care/improve/self-mgmt/pemat/index.html) and seven validated readability calculators.; RESULTS: The most frequent renal diet topic found online was generic dietary information for people with chronic kidney disease. The proportion of renal diet information obtained from websites that was accurate was 73%. However, this information was mostly of poor quality with extensive shortcomings, difficult to action and written with a high health literacy demand. By contrast, renal diet information available from YouTube was highly understandable and actionable, although only 18% of the videos were accurate, and a large proportion were of poor quality with extensive shortcomings. The most frequent authors of accurate, good quality, understandable, material were government bodies, dietitians, academic institutions and medical organisations.; CONCLUSIONS: Renal diet information found online that is written by government bodies, dietitians, academic institutions and medical organisations is recommended. Further work is required to improve the quality and, most importantly, the actionability of renal diet information found online. © 2017 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.

AB Objective Neck masses are common in adults, but often the underlying etiology is not easily identifiable. While infections cause most of the neck masses in children, most persistent neck masses in adults are neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms far exceed any other etiology of adult neck mass. Importantly, an asymptomatic neck mass may be the initial or only clinically apparent manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence suggests that a neck mass in the adult patient should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass due to metastatic HNSCC is paramount because delayed diagnosis directly affects tumor stage and worsens prognosis. Unfortunately, despite substantial advances in testing modalities over the last few decades, diagnostic delays are common. Currently, there is only 1 evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist clinicians in evaluating an adult with a neck mass. Additionally, much of the available information is fragmented, disorganized, or focused on specific etiologies. In addition, although there is literature related to the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, there is little guidance about rational sequencing of tests in the course of clinical care. This guideline strives to bring a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary perspective to the evaluation of the neck mass with the intention to facilitate prompt diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to promote the efficient, effective, and accurate diagnostic workup of neck masses to ensure that adults with potentially malignant disease receive prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize outcomes. Specific goals include reducing delays in diagnosis of HNSCC; promoting appropriate testing, including imaging, pathologic evaluation, and empiric medical therapies; reducing inappropriate testing; and promoting appropriate physical examination when cancer is suspected. The target patient for this guideline is anyone ≥18 years old with a neck mass. The target clinician for this guideline is anyone who may be the first clinician whom a patient with a neck mass encounters. This includes clinicians in primary care, dentistry, and emergency medicine, as well as pathologists and radiologists who have a role in diagnosing neck masses. This guideline does not apply to children. This guideline addresses the initial broad differential diagnosis of a neck mass in an adult. However, the intention is only to assist the clinician with a basic understanding of the broad array of possible entities. The intention is not to direct management of a neck mass known to originate from thyroid, salivary gland, mandibular, or dental pathology as management recommendations for these etiologies already exist. This guideline also does not address the subsequent management of specific pathologic entities, as treatment recommendations for benign and malignant neck masses can be found elsewhere. Instead, this guideline is restricted to addressing the appropriate work-up of an adult patient with a neck mass that may be malignant in order to expedite diagnosis and referral to a head and neck cancer specialist. The Guideline Development Group sought to craft a set of actionable statements relevant to diagnostic decisions made by a clinician in the workup of an adult patient with a neck mass. Furthermore, where possible, the Guideline Development Group incorporated evidence to promote high-quality and cost-effective care. Action Statements The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should order a neck computed tomography (or magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. The development group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy because the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. (2) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on ≥1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size >1.5 cm, or ulceration of overlying skin. (3) Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for patients with a neck mass to identify those with other suspicious findings that represent an increased risk for malignancy. (4) For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation. Clinicians or their designees should also document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis. (5) For patients with a neck mass who are deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests. (6) Clinicians should perform, or refer the patient to a clinician who can perform, a targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx) for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. (7) Clinicians should perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. (8) For patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians should continue evaluation of patients with a cystic neck mass, as determined by FNA or imaging studies, until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign. (9) Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is deemed at increased risk for malignancy who does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging. (10) Clinicians should recommend evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy and without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests. The development group recommended against clinicians routinely prescribing antibiotic therapy for patients with a neck mass unless there are signs and symptoms of bacterial infection.

AB OBJECTIVE: This purpose of this study was to describe and demonstrate CrossCheck, a multimodal data collection system designed to aid in continuous remote monitoring and identification of subjective and objective indicators of psychotic relapse.; METHOD: Individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders received a smartphone with the monitoring system installed along with unlimited data plan for 12 months. Participants were instructed to carry the device with them and to complete brief self-reports multiple times a week. Multimodal behavioral sensing (i.e., physical activity, geospatials activity, speech frequency, and duration) and device use data (i.e., call and text activity, app use) were captured automatically. Five individuals who experienced psychiatric hospitalization were selected and described for instructive purposes.; RESULTS: Participants had unique digital indicators of their psychotic relapse. For some, self-reports provided clear and potentially actionable description of symptom exacerbation prior to hospitalization. Others had behavioral sensing data trends (e.g., shifts in geolocation patterns, declines in physical activity) or device use patterns (e.g., increased nighttime app use, discontinuation of all smartphone use) that reflected the changes they experienced more effectively.; CONCLUSION: Advancements in mobile technology are enabling collection of an abundance of information that until recently was largely inaccessible to clinical research and practice. However, remote monitoring and relapse detection is in its nascence. Development and evaluation of innovative data management, modeling, and signal-detection techniques that can identify changes within an individual over time (i.e., unique relapse signatures) will be essential if we are to capitalize on these data to improve treatment and prevention.

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death among solid malignancies. Unfortunately, PDAC lethality has not substantially decreased over the past 20 years. This aggressiveness is related to the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of PDAC, but also to the absence of an effective screening for the detection of early-stage tumors and a lack of efficient therapeutic options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the arsenal of anti-PDAC drugs for an effective treatment of these patients. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models represent a promising strategy to personalize PDAC treatment, offering a bench testing of candidate treatments and helping to select empirical treatments in PDAC patients with no therapeutic targets. Moreover, bioinformatics-based approaches have the potential to offer systematic insights into PDAC etiology predicting putatively actionable tumor-specific genomic alterations, identifying novel biomarkers and generating disease-associated gene expression signatures. This review focuses on recent efforts to individualize PDAC treatments using PDX models. Additionally, we discuss the current understanding of the PDAC genomic landscape and the putative druggable targets derived from mutational studies. PDAC molecular subclassifications and gene expression profiling studies are reviewed as well. Finally, latest bioinformatics methodologies based on somatic variant detection and prioritization, in silico drug response prediction, and drug repositioning to improve the treatment of advanced PDAC tumors are also covered. © 2017 S.

AB BACKGROUND: Knowledge produced through applied health research is often of a form not readily accessible to or actionable by policymakers and practitioners, which hinders its implementation. Our aim was to identify research activities that can support the production of knowledge tailored to inform policy and practice. To do this, we studied an operational research approach to improving the production of applied health research findings.; METHODS: A 2-year qualitative study was conducted of the operational research contribution to a multidisciplinary applied health research project that was successful in rapidly informing national policy. Semi-structured interviews (n=20) were conducted with all members of the project's research team and advisory group (patient and health professional representatives and academics). These were augmented by participant (>150h) and non-participant (>15h) observations focusing on the process and experience of attempting to support knowledge production. Data were analysed thematically using QSR NVivo software.; RESULTS: Operational research performed a knowledge mediation role shaped by a problem-focused approach and an intent to perform those tasks necessary to producing readily implementable knowledge but outwith the remit of other disciplinary strands of the project. Three characteristics of the role were found to support this: engaging and incorporating different perspectives to improve services by capturing a range of health professional and patient views alongside quantitative and qualitative research evidence; rendering data meaningful by creating and presenting evidence in forms that are accessible to and engage different audiences, enabling them to make sense of it for practical use; and maintaining perceived objectivity and rigour by establishing credibility, perceived neutrality and confidence in the robustness of the research in order to unite diverse professionals in thinking creatively about system-wide service improvement.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes useful empirical insights about knowledge mediation activities within multidisciplinary applied health research projects that support the generation of accessible, practice-relevant and actionable knowledge. Incorporating such activities, or a dedicated role, for mediating knowledge production within such projects could help to enhance the uptake of research findings into routine healthcare and warrants further consideration.

AB Numerous genetic polymorphisms have been identified as associated with disease or treatment outcome, but the routine implementation of genotyping into actionable medical care remains limited. Point-of-care (PoC) technologies enable rapid and real-time treatment decisions, with great potential for extending molecular diagnostic approaches to settings with limited medical infrastructure (e.g., CLIA certified diagnostic laboratories). With respect to resource-limited settings, there is a need for simple devices to implement biomarker guided treatment strategies. One relevant example is chronic hepatitis C infection, for which several treatment options are now approved. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-28B / IFNL3 locus have been well described to predict both spontaneous clearance and response to interferon based therapies. We utilized the Genedrive platform to develop an assay for the SNP rs12979860 variants (CC, CT and TT). The assay utilizes a hybrid thermal engine, permitting rapid heating and cooling, enabling an amplification based assay with genetic variants reported using endpoint differential melting cure analysis in less than 60 minutes. We validated this assay using non-invasive buccal swab sampling in a prospective study of 246 chronic HCV patients, achieving 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity (95% exact CI: 98.8-100%)) in 50 minutes as compared to conventional lab based PCR testing. Our results provide proof of concept that precision medicine is feasible in resource-limited settings, offering the first CE-IVD (in vitro diagnostics) validated PoC SNP test. We propose that IL-28B genotyping may be useful for directing patients towards lower cost therapies, and rationing use of costly direct antivirals for use in those individuals showing genetic risk.

AB BACKGROUND: Gingivo-buccal squamous cell carcinoma (GBSCC) is one of the most common oral cavity cancers in India with less than 50% patients surviving past 5 years. Here, we report a whole transcriptome profile on a batch of GBSCC tumours with diverse tobacco usage habits. The study provides an entire landscape of altered expression with an emphasis on searching for targets with therapeutic potential.; METHODS: Whole transcriptomes of 12 GBSCC tumours and adjacent normal tissues were sequenced and analysed to explore differential expression of genes. Expression changes were further compared with those in TCGA head and neck cohort (n = 263) data base and validated in an independent set of 10GBSCC samples.; RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes (n = 2176) were used to cluster the patients based on their tobacco habits, resulting in 3 subgroups. Immune response was observed to be significantly aberrant, along with cell adhesion and lipid metabolism processes. Different modes of immune evasion were seen across 12 tumours with up-regulation or consistent expression of CD47, unlike other immune evasion genes such as PDL1, FUT4, CTLA4 and BTLA which were downregulated in a few samples. Variation in infiltrating immune cell signatures across tumours also indicates heterogeneity in immune evasion strategies. A few actionable genes such as ITGA4, TGFB1 and PTGS1/COX1 were over expressed in most samples.; CONCLUSION: This study found expression deregulation of key immune evasion genes, such as CD47 and PDL1, and reasserts their potential as effective immunotherapeutic targets for GBSCC, which requires further clinical studies. Present findings reiterate the idea of using transcriptome profiling to guide precision therapeutic strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is an effective platform for identifying clinically actionable mutations across many genes in limited amounts of tissue. Most lung cancers are diagnosed and staged using small tissue samples obtained by transbronchial biopsy (TBB). To determine whether the mutations in TBB specimens detected by amplicon-based MPS reflect those present in the tumors, we compared the mutational profiles of preoperative TBB specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh-frozen primary tumor specimens from non-small-cell lung cancer patients (n= 46) obtained preoperatively by TBB and during surgical resection were analyzed. The concordance of mutations detected by amplicon-based MPS in the 2 sample types was investigated, and the allele frequency of the mutations common to both specimens from the same patient was determined.; RESULTS: An initial assessment of DNA quantity revealed that 46% of the TBB specimens (21 of 46) had less than the lower limit for amplicon-based MPS. These 21 TBB specimens were consequently omitted from the analysis. Of the 29 mutations detected in the TBB and/or surgically resected specimens from 25 patients, 23 were present in both samples, for a concordance rate of 79%.; CONCLUSION: Amplicon-based MPS with TBB specimens approximately reflects clinically relevant tumor mutation profiles. However, the rate of TBB specimens with sufficient DNA quantity for amplicon-based MPS was only around 50%. Therefore, surgically resected specimens have a valuable role in exploratory and comprehensive genomic profiling. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular studies have demonstrated actionable driver oncogene alterations are more frequent in never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The etiology of these driver oncogenes in patients with NSCLC remains unknown, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a potential cause in these cases.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assembled clinical and genetic information for never-smoker patients with NSCLC accrued in Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the United States. To determine an association between cumulative ETS and activating EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, the Mantel extension test was used. Multivariate analysis on activating EGFR and ALK gene rearrangements was performed using the generalized linear mixed model with nations as a random effect.; RESULTS: From July 2007 to December 2012, 498 never-smokers with pathologically proven NSCLC were registered and tested for the association between ETS and EGFR and ALK status. EGFR mutations were more frequent in the ever-ETS cohort (58.4%) compared with the never-ETS cohort (39.6%), and the incidence of EGFR mutations was significantly associated with the increment of cumulative ETS (cETS) in female never-smokers (P= .033), whereas the incidence of ALK rearrangements was not significantly different between the ever-ETS and never-ETS cohorts. Odds ratio for EGFR mutations for each 10-year increment in cETS was 1.091 and 0.89 for female and male never-smokers (P= .031 and P= .263, respectively).; CONCLUSION: Increased ETS exposure was closely associated with EGFR mutations in female never-smokers with NSCLC in the expanded multinational cohort. However, the association of ETS and ALK rearrangements in never-smokers with NSCLC was not significant. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Importance: Guidelines for cancer genetic testing based on family history may miss clinically actionable genetic changes with established implications for cancer screening or prevention.; Objective: To determine the proportion and potential clinical implications of inherited variants detected using simultaneous sequencing of the tumor and normal tissue ("tumor-normal sequencing") compared with genetic test results based on current guidelines.; Design, Setting, and Participants: From January 2014 until May 2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 10 336 patients consented to tumor DNA sequencing. Since May 2015, 1040 of these patients with advanced cancer were referred by their oncologists for germline analysis of 76 cancer predisposition genes. Patients with clinically actionable inherited mutations whose genetic test results would not have been predicted by published decision rules were identified. Follow-up for potential clinical implications of mutation detection was through May 2017.; Exposure: Tumor and germline sequencing compared with the predicted yield of targeted germline sequencing based on clinical guidelines.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of clinically actionable germline mutations detected by universal tumor-normal sequencing that would not have been detected by guideline-directed testing.; Results: Of 1040 patients, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50.5-66 years), 65.3% were male, and 81.3% had stage IV disease at the time of genomic analysis, with prostate, renal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer as the most common diagnoses. Of the 1040 patients, 182 (17.5%; 95% CI, 15.3%-19.9%) had clinically actionable mutations conferring cancer susceptibility, including 149 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations; 101 patients tested (9.7%; 95% CI, 8.1%-11.7%) would not have had these mutations detected using clinical guidelines, including 65 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations. Frequency of inherited mutations was related to case mix, stage, and founder mutations. Germline findings led to discussion or initiation of change to targeted therapy in 38 patients tested (3.7%) and predictive testing in the families of 13 individuals (1.3%), including 6 for whom genetic evaluation would not have been initiated by guideline-based testing.; Conclusions and Relevance: In this referral population with selected advanced cancers, universal sequencing of a broad panel of cancer-related genes in paired germline and tumor DNA samples was associated with increased detection of individuals with potentially clinically significant heritable mutations over the predicted yield of targeted germline testing based on current clinical guidelines. Knowledge of these additional mutations can help guide therapeutic and preventive interventions, but whether all of these interventions would improve outcomes for patients with cancer or their family members requires further study.; Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01775072.

AB The prognosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer remains poor despite recent advances in treatment with multidrug chemotherapy regimens. Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecular targeted therapies has so far been disappointing. This report describes a patient with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) whose tumor was characterized by an activating mutation in exon 19 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). He experienced response to erlotinib for 10 months, and then developed disease progression in association with emergence of the T790M mutation. Activating EGFR mutations in cancers other than lung are uncommon, but when present may predict response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Development of the T790M mutation in this case suggests that EGFR-targeted TKIs may follow similar patterns of resistance regardless of tumor type. Although actionable mutations are detected infrequently in PDAC, this case illustrates the potential benefit of offering genomic analysis to all patients with advanced disease.

AB Ovarian cancer remains a significant cause of gynecologic cancer mortality, and novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed in clinic as new treatment options. We previously showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors displayed promising efficacy for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer by downregulating pivot transcription factors. However, the potential antitumor activities and molecular mechanisms of other epigenetic or transcriptional therapies have not been systematically determined. Here, by performing an unbiased high-throughput drug screen to identify candidate compounds with antineoplastic effects, we identified THZ1, a recently developed covalent CDK7 inhibitor, as a new transcription-targeting compound that exerted broad cytotoxicity against ovarian tumors. Mechanistically, CDK7 represented a previously unappreciated actionable vulnerability in ovarian cancer, and CDK7 inhibition led to a pronounced dysregulation of gene transcription, with a preferential repression of E2F-regulated genes and transcripts associated with super-enhancers. Our findings revealed the molecular underpinnings of THZ1 potency and established pharmaceutically targeting transcriptional addiction as a promising therapeutic strategy in aggressive ovarian cancer.

AB Cancer treatments often require combinations of molecularly targeted agents to be effective. mTORi (rapamycin) and HDACi (MS-275/entinostat) inhibitors have been shown to be effective in limiting tumor growth, and here we define part of the cooperative action of this drug combination. More than 60 human cancer cell lines responded synergistically (CI<1) when treated with this drug combination compared with single agents. In addition, a breast cancer patient-derived xenograft, and a BCL-XL plasmacytoma mouse model both showed enhanced responses to the combination compared with single agents. Mice bearing plasma cell tumors lived an average of 70 days longer on combination treatment compared with single agents. A set of 37 genes cooperatively affected (34 downregulated; 3 upregulated) by the combination responded pharmacodynamically in human myeloma cell lines, xenografts, and a P493 model, and were both enriched in tumors, and correlated with prognostic markers in myeloma patient datasets. Genes downregulated by the combination were overexpressed in several untreated cancers (breast, lung, colon, sarcoma, head and neck, myeloma) compared with normal tissues. The MYC/E2F axis, identified by upstream regulator analyses and validated by immunoblots, was significantly inhibited by the drug combination in several myeloma cell lines. Furthermore, 88% of the 34 genes downregulated have MYC-binding sites in their promoters, and the drug combination cooperatively reduced MYC half-life by 55% and increased degradation. Cells with MYC mutations were refractory to the combination. Thus, integrative approaches to understand drug synergy identified a clinically actionable strategy to inhibit MYC/E2F activity and tumor cell growth in vivoMol Cancer Ther; 16(9); 2008-21. ©2017 AACR. ©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Next-generation or massively parallel sequencing has transformed the landscape of genetic testing for cancer susceptibility. Panel-based genetic tests evaluate multiple genes simultaneously and rapidly. Because these tests are frequently offered in clinical settings, understanding their clinical validity and utility is critical. When evaluating the inherited risk of breast and ovarian cancers, panel-based tests provide incremental benefit compared with BRCA1/2 genetic testing. For inherited risk of other cancers, such as colon cancer and pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma, the clinical utility and yield of panel-based testing are higher; in fact, simultaneous evaluation of multiple genes has been the historical standard for these diseases. Evaluating inherited risk with panel-based testing has recently entered clinical practice for prostate and pancreatic cancers, with potential therapeutic implications. The resulting variants of uncertain significance and mutations with unclear actionability pose challenges to service providers and patients, underscoring the importance of genetic counseling and data-sharing initiatives. This review explores the evolving merits, challenges, and nuances of panel-based testing for cancer susceptibility.

AB Prioritizing molecular alterations that act as drivers of cancer remains a crucial bottleneck in therapeutic development. Here we introduce HIT'nDRIVE, a computational method that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data to identify a set of patient-specific, sequence-altered genes, with sufficient collective influence over dysregulated transcripts. HIT'nDRIVE aims to solve the "random walk facility location" (RWFL) problem in a gene (or protein) interaction network, which differs from the standard facility location problem by its use of an alternative distance measure: "multihitting time," the expected length of the shortest random walk from any one of the set of sequence-altered genes to an expression-altered target gene. When applied to 2200 tumors from four major cancer types, HIT'nDRIVE revealed many potentially clinically actionable driver genes. We also demonstrated that it is possible to perform accurate phenotype prediction for tumor samples by only using HIT'nDRIVE-seeded driver gene modules from gene interaction networks. In addition, we identified a number of breast cancer subtype-specific driver modules that are associated with patients' survival outcome. Furthermore, HIT'nDRIVE, when applied to a large panel of pan-cancer cell lines, accurately predicted drug efficacy using the driver genes and their seeded gene modules. Overall, HIT'nDRIVE may help clinicians contextualize massive multiomics data in therapeutic decision making, enabling widespread implementation of precision oncology. © 2017 Shrestha et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB Concurrent BRAF-MEK inhibition improves clinical outcomes in patients with advanced BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma. There is currently less evidence for the efficacy of this treatment in patients with rare BRAF non-V600E/K genotypes. We report on two patients with rare BRAF exon 15 mutations - BRAF A598_T599insV and V600_K601delinsE - obtaining clinical benefit and a radiological response to inhibitors directed against the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. This highlights the importance of using tests that detect both V600E/K and non-V600E/K BRAF mutations to keep open the possibility of treatment with targeted therapy in patients with uncommon, yet potentially actionable, BRAF exon 15 mutations.

AB Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a highly aggressive B-cell malignancy that is closely associated with one of oncogenic viruses infection, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. PEL prognosis is poor and patients barely survive >6 months even following active chemotherapy interventions. There is therefore an urgent need to discover more effective targets for PEL management. We recently found that the ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit M2 is potentially regulated by the key oncogenic hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET pathway in PEL. In this study, we set to investigate the role of RR in PEL pathogenesis and to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. We report that the RR inhibitor 3-AP actively induces PEL cell cycle arrest through inhibiting the activity of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. Using a xenograft model, we found that 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) effectively suppresses PEL progression in immunodeficient mice. Transcriptome analysis of 3-AP-treated PEL cell lines reveals altered cellular genes, most of whose roles in PEL have not yet been reported. Taken together, we propose that RR and its signaling pathway may serve as novel actionable targets for PEL management.

AB RATIONALE: Implicit theories reflect core assumptions about whether human attributes are malleable or fixed: Incremental theorists believe a characteristic is malleable whereas entity theorists believe it is fixed. People with entity theories about health may be less likely to engage in risk-mitigating behavior. Spontaneous self-affirmation (e.g., reflecting on one's values when threatened) may lessen defensiveness and unhealthy behaviors associated with fixed beliefs, and reduce the likelihood of responding to health risk information with fixed beliefs.; METHOD: Across two studies conducted in the US from 2012 to 2015, we investigated how self-affirmation and implicit theories about health and body weight were linked to engagement with genetic risk information. In Study 1, participants in a genome sequencing trial (n=511) completed cross-sectional assessments of implicit theories, self-affirmation, and intentions to learn, share, and use genetic information. In Study 2, overweight women (n=197) were randomized to receive genetic or behavioral explanations for weight; participants completed surveys assessing implicit theories, self-affirmation, self-efficacy, motivation, and intentions.; RESULTS: Fixed beliefs about weight were infrequently endorsed across studies (10.8-15.2%). In Study 1, participants with stronger fixed theories were less interested in learning and using genetic risk information about medically actionable disease; these associations were weaker among participants higher in self-affirmation. In Study 2, among participants given behavioral explanations for weight, stronger fixed theories about weight were associated with lower motivation and intentions to eat a healthy diet. Among participants given genetic explanations, being higher in self-affirmation was associated with less fixed beliefs.; CONCLUSION: Stronger health-related fixed theories may decrease the likelihood of benefiting from genetic information, but less so for people who self-affirm.

AB BACKGROUND: Advance directives (ADs) and Physicians Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) orders perform different but complementary functions in documenting a patient's treatment preferences and translating them into actionable orders that change in keeping with the patient's evolving clinical picture. Maryland's Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form developed through a stakeholder-driven process that deviates from other POLST forms. While a patient or surrogate can decline discussing MOLST orders with a clinician, clinicians must write MOLST orders for certain patients (e.g., those admitted to a nursing home (NH), assisted living facility (ALF), hospice, home health (HH) agency, or dialysis center, discharged from a hospital to any of these facilities, or transferred between hospitals).; OBJECTIVE: To gather data on Maryland MOLST form use to evaluate performance and inform future research and practice.; DESIGN: Chart reviews (CRs).; SETTING/SUBJECTS: MOLST forms and patient data collected from Maryland hospitals (adult nonpsych, nontrauma, nonobstetric patients), NHs, ALFs, hospices, HH agencies, and dialysis centers.; MEASUREMENTS: Facility demographic tool and CR tools.; RESULTS: A total of 1959 CRs were received from 137 facilities, including 2064 MOLST forms. Most patients required to have MOLST orders had them (84%); fewer had ADs (47%). Few patients or surrogates declined discussing MOLST orders (1%). Few MOLST orders were written based on medical ineffectiveness criteria defined in Maryland law (<1%). MOLST form completion error rates ranged from 1% to 3%. Non-white patients were about twice as likely to have a MOLST "Attempt CPR" order (62%) as white patients (32%).; CONCLUSIONS: MOLST error rates are relatively low and consistent with other research. Areas for improvement include selecting one order option where required, avoiding contradictions between Page 1 and 2 orders, offering MOLST Page 2 options if relevant, and documenting in the medical record a summary of the discussion informing MOLST orders.

AB BACKGROUND: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from the plasma of cancer patients (pts) has been shown to reflect the genomic mutation profile of the tumor. However, physician and patient assessment of clinical utility of these assays in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has not been previously described.; METHODS: Patients were prospectively consented to a prospective genomic matching protocol (Assessment of Targeted Therapies Against Colorectal Cancer [ATTACC]), with collection of blood for cfDNA extraction and sequencing of a 54-gene panel in a CLIA-certified lab. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from prior resections or biopsies underwent 50-gene sequencing. Results from both assays were returned to the treating physicians for patient care and clinical trial selection. Follow-up surveys of treating physicians and chart reviews assessed clinical utility.; RESULTS: 128 mCRC pts were enrolled between 6/2014 and 1/2015. Results were returned in median of 13 and 26 days for cfDNA and FFPE sequencing, respectively. With cfDNA sequencing, 78% (100/128) of samples had a detectable somatic genomic alteration. 50% of cfDNA cases had potentially actionable alterations, and 60% of these could be genomically matched to at least one clinical trial in our institution. 50% (15/30) of these pts enrolled onto an identified matched trial. Physicians reported that the cfDNA testing improved the quality of care they could provide in 73% of the cases, and that 89% of pts reported greater satisfaction with the efforts to personalize experimental therapeutic agents.; CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA sequencing can provide timely information on potentially actionable mutations and amplifications, thereby facilitating clinical trial enrollment and improving the perceived quality of care.

AB The rational treatment of metastatic NSCLC hinges on the timely detection of potentially targetable genomic alterations to guide therapy. Recent advances in highly sensitive genotyping technologies have allowed for development of novel plasma genotyping assays that are capable of noninvasively detecting targetable alterations in plasma cell-free DNA without reliance on traditional tissue genotyping. The rapid development of plasma genotyping has led to an explosion in the number of assay platforms available from both commercial and laboratory sources. The sheer number of such platforms has led to confusion among oncologists as to both the test characteristics and limitations of individual plasma genotyping assays and the clinical context in which these tests may be utilized either alone or in combination with traditional tissue genotyping. Reliable data from prospective validation against a tissue genotyping reference standard are available for only a limited number of platforms. Careful retrospective validation of alternative platforms utilizing paired tissue andplasma specimens collected under the auspices of clinical trials represent an alternative but reliable validation strategy. A consistent trend among these well-validated plasma genotypingassays has been the observation of high specificity and positive predictive value and more limited sensitivity. Atpresent, validated assays can be considered actionable in instances in which a targetable genomic alteration is detected or an alternative nontargetable driver mutation is detected and can be used to infer the absence of one of the former.

AB Hospitalization is known to occur frequently in the first 6 months following liver transplantation (LT). Using a novel data linkage between the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, our study has 2 objectives: (1) to determine risk factors for "early" hospitalization (ie, within 6 months of LT); and (2) to quantify the importance of hospitalization history in the first 6 months with respect to subsequent patient survival (ie, survival, conditional on surviving 6 months post-LT). The study population consisted of patients aged ≥18 years who underwent deceased donor LT between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2010, with Medicare as primary or secondary insurance and were discharged alive from the index LT hospitalization (n=7220). The early hospitalization rate was 2.76 per patient-year and was significantly associated with many recipient factors (eg, recipient age, hepatitis C, diabetes, poor renal function including dialysis, and recipient of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure before LT), as well as donor race and donation after cardiac death. Conditional on surviving 6 months after LT, the covariate-adjusted death rate increased by 22% for each additional hospitalization occurring in the first 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.22; P<0.001). In conclusion, several LT recipient factors are significantly associated with early hospitalization. Moreover, a patient's hospitalization profile during follow-up months 0-6 is a very strong predictor of survival thereafter. Efforts and resources should be devoted toward identifying LT recipients at risk for early hospitalization and modifying the actionable risk factors such as hepatitis C, diabetes, and body mass index to improve resource utilization and overall outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVES: Pemetrexed continuation maintenance therapy after induction with platinum-based chemotherapy is a standard treatment option for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, discontinuation of maintenance therapy is still a challenge in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate interfering factors and clinical risk associated with discontinuation of pemetrexed maintenance therapy (PMT).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who received PMT between December 2011 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients' characteristics, performance status (PS), response and toxicity evaluation were collected. The reasons for PMT discontinuation were summarized. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model.; RESULTS: Of the 220 patients included for final analysis, 132 patients (60.0%) continued PMT until disease progression. The patients over 60 years old (p=0.021), the patients with PS 2 at the initiation of PMT (p=0.005) and the patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicity during PMT (p<0.001) had a higher discontinuation rate. The reasons for PMT discontinuation were the regarding toxicity (39.8%), high intensity of hospital visit (17.0%), treatment cost (13.6%), patients' preference (26.1%) and failure of pain control (3.4%). In univariate analysis, PS 0-1 at the initiation of PMT (5.6 versus 4.3 months, p=0.022) and PMT continuation (5.6 versus 4.3 months, p<0.001) were associated with improved PFS. And PMT continuation was associated with improved OS (19.2 versus 16.8 months, p=0.003) along with actionable mutations and PS 0-1 at the initiation of PMT. In multivariate analysis, PMT continuation (hazard ratio: 1.486; 95% CI: 1.050-2.104; p=0.025) was an independent prognostic factor regarding OS benefit assessed by Cox proportional hazard model.; CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of PMT is common in clinical practice. The survival benefit suggests that fit patients should be encouraged to continue PMT until disease progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating EGFR mutations generally involve development of acquired secondary or tertiary EGFR mutations, such as T790M or C797S. However, case reports have demonstrated that actionable receptor tyrosine kinase fusions such as EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET, and FGFR3-TACC3 can potentially confer resistance to EGFR TKIs. We seeked to identify the prevalence of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts as resistance mechanism to EGFR TKIs. Hybrid-capture based genomic profiling was performed on FFPE tissue samples and circulating tumor DNA isolated from peripheral whole blood in the course of clinical care. We performed a comprehensive survey of 17,319 clinical NSCLC samples (14,170 adenocarcinomas and 3149 NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS)) and identified 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 containing the intact kinase domain of FGFR3 and the coiled-coil domain of TACC3 emerging after treatment with EGFR TKIs, including one previously reported index case. Of the 4 novel cases of FGFR3-TACC3, one emerged after erlotinib, one after afatinib, one after osimertinib, and one after ASP8273. These 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions acquired post-EGFR TKI, while rare, indicate that FGFR3-TACC3 is a recurrent resistance mechanism, which can bypass EGFR blockade by all generations of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC. Routine re-biopsy and genomic profiling using platforms capable of detecting kinase fusions has the potential to inform new therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC progressing on TKIs.

AB Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as a noninvasive technique for detecting targetable mutations. We describe two lung adenocarcinoma cases that show the clinical utility of supplementing tumor biopsy molecular interrogation with ctDNA NGS. For both cases, ctDNA NGS identified actionable mutations that were previously not reported by molecular interrogation of tissue. Explanations are provided for the observed differences between ctDNA and tumor biopsy genomic results along with considerations for reconciling findings. Case 1 consisted of a patient with multiple lesions in the left and right lung that was initially suspected to be related to malignancy. A tumor biopsy was positive for EGFR-mutated lung cancer. ctDNA NGS reported an activating KRAS mutation, which was unexpected given the rare occurrence of EGFR/KRAS co-mutations. Radiologic imaging and ctDNA NGS resulted in the diagnoses of synchronous EGFR-mutated left lung cancer and KRAS-mutated right lung cancer. The second case describes a patient who was negative for RET rearrangements by tissue interrogation, but positive for a RET-KIF5B fusion by ctDNA NGS. Further tissue analysis demonstrated heterogeneity was the cause of differing results. We demonstrate that supplementing tumor biopsies with ctDNA NGS has a crucial role in patient care. Understanding the causes of differing ctDNA and tumor biopsy genomic results is essential for reconciling findings and application to precision medicine management. Copyright © 2017.

AB This paper describes a natural language processing (NLP)-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that is geared towards colon cancer care coordinators as the end users. The system is implemented using a metadata- driven Structured Query Language (SQL) function (discriminant function). For our pilot study, we have developed a training corpus consisting of 2,085 pathology reports from the VA Connecticut Health Care System (VACHS). We categorized reports as "actionable"- requiring close follow up, or "non-actionable"- requiring standard or no follow up. We then used 600 distinct pathology reports from 6 different VA sites as our test corpus. Analysis of our test corpus shows that our NLP approach yields 98.5% accuracy in identifying cases that required close clinical follow up. By integrating this into our cancer care tracking system, our goal is to ensure that patients with worrisome pathology receive appropriate and timely follow-up and care.

AB Current motor assessment tools can provide numerical indicators of performance but do not provide actionable information to target further improvement in rehabilitation interventions. Psychophysics-based outcome measures show promise to provide more useful information in the laboratory environment but have been limited in clinical implementation. Here we present a constrained-time task to assess paced and non-rhythmic movements. The task's output metrics include trial-by-trial adaptation rate and the just noticeable difference of a perturbation. We show that the task's metrics are reliable (i.e. high test-retest reliability) and are responsive to changes in feedback type and experience. We also discuss the task's versatility to be used for other types of movements including grasping. The consistent, sensitive and flexible time-constrained movement task we present provides a foundation from which to develop advanced outcome measures for prosthesis users and for other rehabilitation contexts.

AB Bone metastases (BoM) are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer; yet, characterizations of human specimens are limited. In this study, exome-capture RNA sequencing (ecRNA-seq) on aged (8-12 years), formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and decalcified cancer specimens was evaluated. Gene expression values and ecRNA-seq quality metrics from FFPE or decalcified tumor RNA showed minimal differences when compared with matched flash-frozen or nondecalcified tumors. ecRNA-seq was then applied on a longitudinal collection of 11 primary breast cancers and patient-matched synchronous or recurrent BoMs. Overtime, BoMs exhibited gene expression shifts to more Her2 and LumB PAM50 subtype profiles, temporally influenced expression evolution, recurrently dysregulated prognostic gene sets, and longitudinal expression alterations of clinically actionable genes, particularly in the CDK/Rb/E2F and FGFR signaling pathways. Taken together, this study demonstrates the use of ecRNA-seq on decade-old and decalcified specimens and defines recurrent longitudinal transcriptional remodeling events in estrogen-deprived breast cancers.

AB Cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) are diverse epithelial tumors arising from the liver or large bile ducts with features of cholangiocyte differentiation. CCAs are classified anatomically into intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar (pCCA), and distal CCA (dCCA). Each subtype has distinct risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, therapeutic options, and prognosis. CCA is an aggressive malignancy with a poor overall prognosis and median survival of less than 2years in patients with advanced disease. Potentially curative surgical treatment options are limited to the subset of patients with early-stage disease. Presently, the available systemic medical therapies for advanced or metastatic CCA have limited therapeutic efficacy. Molecular alterations define the differences in biological behavior of each CCA subtype. Recent comprehensive genetic analysis has better characterized the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of each CCA subtype. Promising candidates for targeted, personalized therapy have emerged, including potential driver fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions and somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 in iCCA, protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha (PRKACA) or beta (PRKACB) gene fusions in pCCA, and ELF3 mutations in dCCA/ampullary carcinoma. A precision genomic medicine approach is dependent on an enhanced understanding of driver mutations in each subtype and stratification of patients according to their genetic drivers. We review the current genomic landscape of CCA, the potentially actionable molecular aberrations in each CCA subtype, and the role of immunotherapy in CCA.

AB Circulating tumor cell (CTC) as an important component in "liquid biopsy" holds crucial clinical relevance in cancer prognosis, treatment efficiency evaluation, prediction and potentially early detection. Here, we present a Fiber-optic Array Scanning Technology (FAST) that enables antigen-agnostic, size-agnostic detection of CTC. By immunofluorescence staining detection of a combination of a panel of markers, FAST technology can be applied to detect rare CTC in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting with high sensitivity and specificity. In combination with Automated Digital Microscopy (ADM) platform, companion markers on CTC such as Vimentin and Programmed death-ligand 1﻿ (PD-L1) can also be analyzed to further characterize these CTCs. FAST data output is also compatible with downstream single cell picking platforms. Single cell can be isolated post ADM confirmation and used for "actionable" genetic mutations analysis.

AB Patterns of genomic evolution between primary and metastatic breast cancer have not been studied in large numbers, despite patients with metastatic breast cancer having dismal survival. We sequenced whole genomes or a panel of 365 genes on 299 samples from 170 patients with locally relapsed or metastatic breast cancer. Several lines of analysis indicate that clones seeding metastasis or relapse disseminate late from primary tumors, but continue to acquire mutations, mostly accessing the same mutational processes active in the primary tumor. Most distant metastases acquired driver mutations not seen in the primary tumor, drawing from a wider repertoire of cancer genes than early drivers. These include a number of clinically actionable alterations and mutations inactivating SWI-SNF and JAK2-STAT3 pathways. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Despite intensive multimodal treatment of sarcomas, a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors arising from connective tissue, survival remains poor. Candidate-based targeted treatments have demonstrated limited clinical success, urging an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of oncogenic signaling networks to reveal therapeutic targets and personalized treatment strategies. Here we applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic profiling to the largest and most heterogeneous set of sarcoma cell lines characterized to date and identified novel tyrosine phosphorylation patterns, enhanced tyrosine kinases in specific subtypes, and potential driver kinases. ALK was identified as a novel driver in the Aska-SS synovial sarcoma (SS) cell line via expression of an ALK variant with a large extracellular domain deletion (ALKDelta2-17). Functional ALK dependency was confirmed in vitro and in vivo with selective inhibitors. Importantly, ALK immunopositivity was detected in 6 of 43 (14%) of SS patient specimens, one of which exhibited an ALK rearrangement. High PDGFRalpha phosphorylation also characterized SS cell lines, which was accompanied by enhanced MET activation in Yamato-SS cells. Although Yamato-SS cells were sensitive to crizotinib (ALK/MET-inhibitor) but not pazopanib (VEGFR/PDGFR-inhibitor) monotherapy in vitro, synergistic effects were observed upon drug combination. In vivo, both drugs were individually effective, with pazopanib efficacy likely attributable to reduced angiogenesis. MET or PDGFRalpha expression was detected in 58% and 84% of SS patients, respectively, with coexpression in 56%. Consequently, our integrated approach has led to the identification of ALK and MET as promising therapeutic targets in SS.

AB Cancer aggressiveness may result from the selective pressure of a harsh nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Here we illustrate how such conditions promote chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Glucose or glutamine withdrawal resulted in a 5- to 10-fold protective effect with chemotherapy treatment. PDAC xenografts were less sensitive to gemcitabine in hypoglycemic mice compared with hyperglycemic mice. Consistent with this observation, patients receiving adjuvant gemcitabine (n = 107) with elevated serum glucose levels (HgbA1C > 6.5%) exhibited improved survival. We identified enhanced antioxidant defense as a driver of chemoresistance in this setting. ROS levels were doubled in vitro by either nutrient withdrawal or gemcitabine treatment, but depriving PDAC cells of nutrients before gemcitabine treatment attenuated this effect. Mechanistic investigations based on RNAi or CRISPR approaches implicated the RNA binding protein HuR in preserving survival under nutrient withdrawal, with or without gemcitabine. Notably, RNA deep sequencing and functional analyses in HuR-deficient PDAC cell lines identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) as the sole antioxidant enzyme under HuR regulation. HuR-deficient PDAC cells lacked the ability to engraft successfully in immunocompromised mice, but IDH1 overexpression in these cells was sufficient to fully restore chemoresistance under low nutrient conditions. Overall, our findings highlight the HuR-IDH1 regulatory axis as a critical, actionable therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.

AB Targeting somatically activated oncogenes has revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mutations in the gene mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) near the exon 14 splice sites are recurrent in lung adenocarcinoma and cause exon skipping (METDelta14). Here, we analyzed 4,422 samples from 12 different malignancies to estimate the rate of said exon skipping. METDelta14 mutation and transcript were most common in lung adenocarcinoma. Endogenously expressed levels of METDelta14 transformed human epithelial lung cells in a hepatocyte growth factor-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of the orthologous mouse allele induced lung adenocarcinoma in a novel, immunocompetent mouse model. Met inhibition showed clinical benefit in this model. In addition, we observed a clinical response to crizotinib in a patient with METDelta14-driven NSCLC, only to observe new missense mutations in the MET activation loop, critical for binding to crizotinib, upon clinical progression. These findings support genomically selected clinical trials directed toward METDelta14 in a fraction of NSCLC patients, confirm second-site mutations for further therapeutic targeting prior to and beyond acquired resistance, and provide an in vivo system for the study of METDelta14 in an immunocompetent host.

AB Noninvasive genomic profiling of tumors may be possible with next-generation sequencing (NGS) of blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), but proof of concept in a large cohort of patients with diverse cancers has yet to be reported. Here we report the results of an analysis of plasma-derived ctDNA from 670 patients with diverse cancers. The tumors represented in the patient cohort were mainly gastrointestinal (31.8%), brain (22.7%), or lung (20.7%). ctDNA obtained from most patients [N = 423 (63%)] displayed at least one alteration. The most frequent alterations seen, as characterized mutations or variants of unknown significance, occurred in TP53 (32.5% of patients), EGFR (13%), KRAS (12.5%), and PIK3CA (9.1%); for characterized alterations, 30.7% (TP53), 7.6% (EGFR), 12.2% (KRAS), and 7.7% (PIK3CA). We found that 32% of brain tumors had at least one ctDNA alteration. Head and neck tumors were independently associated with a higher number of alterations in a multivariable analysis (P = 0.019). Notably, 320/670 (48%) of patients displayed potentially actionable alterations, with 241 patients possible candidates for on-label or off-label treatment with an FDA-approved drug. Several illustrations of the clinical utility of the information obtained for improving treatment of specific patients is provided. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and impact of genomic profiling of tumors by ctDNA NGS, greatly encouraging broader investigations of the application of this technology for precision medicine in cancer management.

AB The incorporation of human rights in health policy and programmes is known to strengthen responses to health problems and help address disparities created or exacerbated by illness yet this remains underexplored in relation to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Aiming to understand existing synergies and how they might be further strengthened, we assessed the extent to which human rights are considered in global NCD policies and strategies and the degree of attention given to NCDs by select United Nations human rights mechanisms. Across global NCD policies and strategies, rhetorical assertions regarding human rights appear more often than actionable statements, thus limiting their implementation and impact. Although no human rights treaty explicitly mentions NCDs, some human rights monitoring mechanisms have been paying increasing attention to NCDs. This provides important avenues for promoting the incorporation of human rights norms and standards into NCD responses as well as for accountability. Linking NCDs and human rights at the global level is critical for encouraging national-level action to promote better outcomes relating to both health and human rights. The post-2015 development agenda constitutes a key entry point for highlighting these synergies and strengthening opportunities for health and rights action at global, national and local levels.

AB Interpersonal violence is a major contributor to the burden of disease globally, and in South Africa, it is the leading cause of injury. There is an emerging consensus that the development of actionable policy and effective prevention strategies for interpersonal violence requires an understanding of the contextual matters that elevate risk for interpersonal violence. The objective of this study was to explore community perceptions of risks for interpersonal violence in five townships in Cape Town, South Africa, with high rates of violence. Focus group discussions were conducted with community members to identify key factors in that contributed to being either a perpetrator or victim of interpersonal violence. The ecological framework was used to classify the risk factors as occurring at individual, relationship, community or society levels. Some of the risk factors identified included alcohol abuse, poverty, informality of settlements and cultural norms. Differences in how each of these risk factors are expressed and experienced in the five communities are also elucidated. This approach enabled the collection of contextual community-based data that can complement conventional surveillance data in the development of relevant community-level strategies for interpersonal violence prevention.

AB OBJECTIVES: People of South Asian ethnicity are under-represented in health research studies. The objectives of this scoping review were to examine the barriers and facilitators to recruitment of South Asians to health research studies and to describe strategies for improving recruitment.; DESIGN: Scoping review METHODS: Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews, we comprehensively searched electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO). Studies that identified barriers and facilitators to recruitment, or recruitment strategies for South Asian populations were included. Recruitment barriers, facilitators and strategies were grouped thematically and summarised narratively.; SYNTHESIS: Of 1846 potentially relevant articles, 15 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the thematic synthesis. Multiple facilitators and barriers to enrolment of South Asians in health research studies were identified; these most commonly related to logistical challenges, language and cultural barriers, concerns about adverse consequences of participating and mistrust of research. Several actionable strategies were discussed, the most common being engagement of South Asian communities, demonstration of cultural competency, provision of incentives and benefits, language sensitivity through the use of translators and translated materials and the development of trust and personal relationships.; CONCLUSION: There is a growing awareness of the barriers and facilitators to recruitment of South Asian participants to health research studies. Knowledge of effective recruitment strategies and implementation during the grant funding stages may reduce the risk of poor recruitment and representation of South Asians. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

AB Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is an infrequent but highly lethal disease, almost invariably treated with platinum-based therapies. Improving the response to platinum represents a great challenge, since it could significantly impact on patient survival. Here, we report that silencing or pharmacological inhibition of CDK6 increases EOC cell sensitivity to platinum. We observed that, upon platinum treatment, CDK6 phosphorylated and stabilized the transcription factor FOXO3, eventually inducing ATR transcription. Blockage of this pathway resulted in EOC cell death, due to altered DNA damage response accompanied by increased apoptosis. These observations were recapitulated in EOC cell lines invitro, in xenografts invivo, and in primary tumor cells derived from platinum-treated patients. Consistently, high CDK6 and FOXO3 expression levels in primary EOC predict poor patient survival. Our data suggest that CDK6 represents an actionable target that can be exploited to improve platinum efficacy in EOC patients. As CDK4/6 inhibitors are successfully used in cancer patients, our findings can be immediately transferred to the clinic to improve the outcome of EOC patients. © 2017 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND: Physiologic monitors generate high rates of alarms in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), yet few are actionable.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between a huddle-based intervention focused on reducing unnecessary alarms and the change in individual patients' alarm rates in the 24 hours after huddles.; DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study with concurrent and historical controls.; SETTING: A 55-bed PICU.; PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred low-acuity patients with more than 40 alarms during the 4 hours preceding a safety huddle in the PICU between April 1, 2015, and October 31, 2015.; INTERVENTION: Structured safety huddle review and discussion of alarm causes and possible monitor parameter adjustments to reduce unnecessary alarms.; MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Rate of priority alarms per 24 hours occurring for intervention patients as compared with concurrent and historical controls. Balancing measures included unexpected changes in patient acuity and code blue events.; RESULTS: Clinicians adjusted alarm parameters in the 5 hours following the huddles in 42% of intervention patients compared with 24% of control patients (𝑃 = .002). The estimate of the effect of the intervention adjusted for age and sex compared with concurrent controls was a reduction of 116 priority alarms (95% confidence interval, 37-194) per 24 hours (𝑃 = .004). There were no unexpected changes in patient acuity or code blue events related to the intervention.; CONCLUSIONS: Integrating a data-driven monitor alarm discussion into safety huddles was a safe and effective approach to reducing alarms in low-acuity, highalarm PICU patients. © 2017 Society of Hospital Medicine

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of ≤7% across all stages. The limited success of conventional therapies for PDAC is at least partially attributable to its genetic heterogeneity. Precision targeting of known PDAC subtypes may positively affect the outcome of this disease. An important actionable subtype in this cancer is associated with DNA repair dysfunction, including cases with germline BRCA mutations. This subtype can be targeted by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). BRCA mutation-associated PDAC may be the first biomarker-driven subtype in this disease that can be successfully targeted. However, DNA repair defects can extend beyond the narrow spectrum of BRCA1/2 mutations in PDAC and are present in a large proportion of patients with familial PDAC. This review describes the subgroup of patients with PDAC with aberrant DNA repair and discusses diagnostic and therapeutic options. Copyright © 2017 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

AB INTRODUCTION: In recent years, molecular characterization of renal cell carcinoma has facilitated the identification of driver genes, specific molecular pathways, and characterization of the tumor microenvironment, which has led to a better understanding of the disease. This comprehension has revolutionized the treatment for patients with metastatic disease, but despite these advancements many patients will develop resistance leading to treatment failure. A primary cause of this resistance and subsequent treatment failure is tumor heterogeneity. We reviewed the literature on the mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity and its clinical implications.; METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the MEDLINE/PubMed Index.; RESULTS: Intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity is possibly a reason for treatment failure and development of resistance. Specifically, the genetic profile of a renal tumor differs spatially within a tumor as well as among patients. Genomic mutations can change temporally with resistant subclones becoming dominant over time.; CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity with better sampling of cancer tissue is needed. This will hopefully lead to improved identification of driver mutations and actionable targets. Only then, we can move past the one-size-fits-all approach toward personalized treatment based on each individual׳s molecular profile. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Toward development of a precision medicine framework for metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we established a multi-institutional clinical sequencing infrastructure to conduct prospective whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of bone or soft tissue tumor biopsies from a cohort of 150 mCRPC affected individuals. Aberrations of AR, ETS genes, TP53, and PTEN were frequent (40%-60% of cases), with TP53 and AR alterations enriched in mCRPC compared to primary prostate cancer. We identified new genomic alterations in PIK3CA/B, R-spondin, BRAF/RAF1, APC, beta-catenin, and ZBTB16/PLZF. Moreover, aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM were observed at substantially higher frequencies (19.3% overall) compared to those in primary prostate cancers. A total of 89% of affected individuals harbored a clinically actionable aberration, including 62.7% with aberrations in AR, 65% in other cancer-related genes, and 8% with actionable pathogenic germline alterations. This cohort study provides clinically actionable information that could affect treatment decisions for these affected individuals. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases are a significant public health concern, particularly in older adults. To address the delivery of health care services to optimally meet the needs of older adults with multiple chronic diseases, Health TAPESTRY (Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality) uses a novel approach that involves patient home visits by trained volunteers to collect and transmit relevant health information using e-health technology to inform appropriate care from an inter-professional healthcare team. Health TAPESTRY was implemented, pilot tested, and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (analysis underway). Knowledge translation (KT) interventions such as Health TAPESTRY should involve an investigation of their sustainability and scalability determinants to inform further implementation. However, this is seldom considered in research or considered early enough, so the objectives of this study were to assess the sustainability and scalability potential of Health TAPESTRY from the perspective of the team who developed and pilot-tested it.; METHODS: Our objectives were addressed using a sequential mixed-methods approach involving the administration of a validated, sustainability survey developed by the National Health Service (NHS) to all members of the Health TAPESTRY team who were actively involved in the development, implementation and pilot evaluation of the intervention (Phase 1: n=38). Mean sustainability scores were calculated to identify the best potential for improvement across sustainability factors. Phase 2 was a qualitative study of interviews with purposively selected Health TAPESTRY team members to gain a more in-depth understanding of the factors that influence the sustainability and scalability Health TAPESTRY. Two independent reviewers coded transcribed interviews and completed a multi-step thematic analysis. Outcomes were participant perceptions of the determinants influencing the sustainability and scalability of Health TAPESTRY.; RESULTS: Twenty Health TAPESTRY team members (53% response rate) completed the NHS sustainability survey. The overall mean sustainability score was 64.6 (range 22.8-96.8). Important opportunities for improving sustainability were better staff involvement and training, clinical leadership engagement, and infrastructure for sustainability. Interviews with 25 participants (response rate 60%) showed that factors influencing the sustainability and scalability of Health TAPESTRY emerged across two dimensions: I) Health TAPESTRY operations (development and implementation activities undertaken by the central team); and II) the Health TAPESTRY intervention (factors specific to the intervention and its elements). Resource capacity appears to be an important factor to consider for Health TAPESTRY operations as it was identified across both sustainability and scalability factors; and perceived lack of interprofessional team and volunteer resource capacity and the need for stakeholder buy-in are important considerations for the Health TAPESTRY intervention. We used these findings to create actionable recommendations to initiate dialogue among Health TAPESTRY team members to improve the intervention.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified sustainability and scalability determinants of the Health TAPESTRY intervention that can be used to optimize its potential for impact. Next steps will involve using findings to inform a guide to facilitate sustainability and scalability of Health TAPESTRY in other jurisdictions considering its adoption. Our findings build on the limited current knowledge of sustainability, and advances KT science related to the sustainability and scalability of KT interventions.

AB C-terminal Binding Proteins (CtBP) 1 and 2 are oncogenic transcriptional co-regulators overexpressed in many cancer types, with their expression level correlating to worse prognostic outcomes and aggressive tumor features. CtBP negatively regulates the expression of many tumor suppressor genes, while coactivating genes that promote proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cancer stem cell self-renewal activity. In light of this evidence, the development of novel inhibitors that mitigate CtBP function may provide clinically actionable therapeutic tools. This review article focuses on the progress made in understanding CtBP structure, role in tumor progression, and discovery and development of CtBP inhibitors that target CtBP's dehydrogenase activity and other functions, with a focus on the theory and rationale behind the designs of current inhibitors. We provide insight into the future development and use of rational combination therapy that may further augment the efficacy of CtBP inhibitors, specifically addressing metastasis and cancer stem cell populations within tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Through the conduct of an individual-based intervention study, the main purpose of this project was to build and evaluate the required infrastructure that may enable routine practice of precision cancer medicine in the public health services of Norway, including modelling of costs.; METHODS: An eligible patient had end-stage metastatic disease from a solid tumour. Metastatic tissue was analysed by DNA sequencing, using a 50-gene panel and a study-generated pipeline for analysis of sequence data, supplemented with fluorescence in situ hybridisation to cover relevant biomarkers. Cost estimations compared best supportive care, biomarker-agnostic treatment with a molecularly targeted agent and biomarker-based treatment with such a drug. These included costs for medication, outpatient clinic visits, admission from adverse events and the biomarker-based procedures.; RESULTS: The diagnostic procedures, which comprised sampling of metastatic tissue, mutation analysis and data interpretation at the Molecular Tumor Board before integration with clinical data at the Clinical Tumor Board, were completed in median 18 (8-39) days for the 22 study patients. The 23 invasive procedures (12 from liver, 6 from lung, 5 from other sites) caused a single adverse event (pneumothorax). Per patient, 0-5 mutations were detected in metastatic tumours; however, no actionable target case was identified for the current single-agent therapy approach. Based on the cost modelling, the biomarker-based approach was 2.5-fold more costly than best supportive care and 2.5-fold less costly than the biomarker-agnostic option.; CONCLUSIONS: The first project phase established a comprehensive diagnostic infrastructure for precision cancer medicine, which enabled expedite and safe mutation profiling of metastatic tumours and data interpretation at multidisciplinary tumour boards for patients with end-stage cancer. Furthermore, it prepared for protocol amendments, recently approved by the designated authorities for the second study phase, allowing more comprehensive mutation analysis and opportunities to define therapy targets.

AB Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the core treatment strategy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tumours that do not have actionable molecular alterations, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitising mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocationsor ROS1 translocations. Age and performance status (PS) are two pivotal factors to guide treatment decisions regarding the use of chemotherapy in lung cancer patients. Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with more than two-thirds of patients aged ≥65 years, the current definition of 'elderly'. The prevalence of poor PS, as estimated by patients themselves, can be as high as 50%. Both the elderly and PS2 patients are underrepresented in clinical trials. Therefore, optimising treatment strategy for the subgroup of elderly or PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC remains challenging as a result of a paucity of clinical trial data. The current review focusses on the elderly or PS2 patients without actionable oncogenic drivers and attempts to summarise current available data on recent treatments trials including angiogenesis inhibitors and immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

AB Despite global progress in research, improved screening and refined treatment strategies, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains as the third most common malignancy. As each type of cancer is different and exhibits unique alteration patterns, identifying and characterizing gene alterations in CRC that may serve as biomarkers might help to improve diagnosis, prognosis and predict potential response to therapy. With the emergence of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS), it is now possible to extensively and rapidly identify the gene profile of individual tumors. In this study, we aimed to identify actionable somatic alterations in Dukes' B and C in CRC via NGS. Targeted sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes using the Ion AmpliseqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was performed on genomic DNA obtained from paired fresh frozen tissues, cancer and normal, of Dukes' B (n = 10) and Dukes' C (n = 9) CRC. The sequencing results were analyzed using Torrent Suite, annotated using ANNOVAR and validated using Sanger sequencing. A total of 141 somatic non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in 86 genes. Among these, 64 variants (45%) were predicted to be deleterious, 38 variants (27%) possibly deleterious while the other 39 variants (28%) have low or neutral protein impact. Seventeen genes have alterations with frequencies of ≥10% in the patient cohort and with 14 overlapped genes in both Dukes' B and C. The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) was the most frequently altered gene in both groups (n = 6 in Dukes' B and C). In addition, TP53 was more frequently altered in Dukes' C (n = 7) compared to Dukes' B (n = 4). Ten variants in APC, namely p.R283, p.N778fs, p.R805, p.Y935fs, p.E941fs, p.E1057, p.I1401fs, p.Q1378, p.E1379, and p.A1485fs were predicted to be driver variants. APC remains as the most frequently altered gene in the intermediate stages of CRC. Wnt signaling pathway is the major affected pathway followed by P53, RAS, TGF-beta, and PI3K signaling. We reported the alteration profiles in each of the patient which has the potential to affect the clinical decision. We believe that this study will add further to the understanding of CRC molecular landscape.

AB Next generation sequencing (NGS) identifies alterations that may be potentially targetable by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and/or by available experimental agents that may not have otherwise been contemplated. Many targeted drugs have been developed for diverse solid cancers; a smaller number of genomically targeted drugs have been approved for lymphoid malignancies. We analyzed NGS results from 60 patients with various lymphoid malignancies and found a total of 224 alterations (median per patient = 3). Forty-nine patients (82%) had potentially actionable alterations using FDA-approved drugs and/or experimental therapies; only 11 patients (18%) had no theoretically actionable alterations. Only three patients (5%) had an alteration for which an approved drug in the disease is available (on-label); 45 patients (75%) had an alteration for which an approved drug is available in another disease (off-label). The median number of alterations per patient potentially actionable by an FDA-approved drug was 1. Interestingly, 19 of 60 patients (32%) had intermediate to high tumor mutational burden, which may predict response to certain immunotherapy agents. In conclusion, NGS identifies alterations that may be pharmacologically tractable in most patients with lymphoid malignancies, albeit with drugs that have usually been developed in the context of solid tumors. These observations merit expanded exploration in the clinical trials setting.

AB BACKGROUND: There is an emergent and intensive dialogue in the United States with regard to the accessibility, reproducibility, and rigor of health research. This discussion is also closely aligned with the need to identify sustainable ways to expand the national research enterprise and to generate actionable results that can be applied to improve the nation's health. The principles and practices of Open Science offer a promising path to address both goals by facilitating (1) increased transparency of data and methods, which promotes research reproducibility and rigor; and (2) cumulative efficiencies wherein research tools and the output of research are combined to accelerate the delivery of new knowledge in proximal domains, thereby resulting in greater productivity and a reduction in redundant research investments.; OBJECTIVES: AcademyHealth's Electronic Data Methods (EDM) Forum implemented a proof-of-concept open science platform for health research called the Collaborative Informatics Environment for Learning on Health Outcomes (CIELO).; METHODS: The EDM Forum conducted a user-centered design process to elucidate important and high-level requirements for creating and sustaining an open science paradigm.; RESULTS: By implementing CIELO and engaging a variety of potential users in its public beta testing, the EDM Forum has been able to elucidate a broad range of stakeholder needs and requirements related to the use of an open science platform focused on health research in a variety of "real world" settings.; CONCLUSIONS: Our initial design and development experience over the course of the CIELO project has provided the basis for a vigorous dialogue between stakeholder community members regarding the capabilities that will add the greatest value to an open science platform for the health research community. A number of important questions around user incentives, sustainability, and scalability will require further community dialogue and agreement. ©Philip Payne, Omkar Lele, Beth Johnson, Erin Holve.

AB OBJECTIVE Meningiomas located in the skull base are surgically challenging. Recent genomic research has identified oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations in a small subset of meningiomas. METHODS The authors performed targeted sequencing in a large cohort of patients with anterior skull base meningiomas (n = 62) to better define the frequency of SMO and AKT1 mutations in these tumors. RESULTS The authors found SMO mutations in 7 of 62 (11%) and AKT1 mutations in 12 of 62 (19%) of their cohort. Of the 7 meningiomas with SMO mutations, 6 (86%) occurred in the olfactory groove. Meningiomas with an SMO mutation presented with significantly larger tumor volume (70.6 ± 36.3 cm3) compared with AKT1-mutated (18.2 ± 26.8 cm3) and wild-type (22.7 ± 23.9 cm3) meningiomas, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Combined, these data demonstrate clinically actionable mutations in 30% of anterior skull base meningiomas and suggest an association between SMO mutation status and tumor volume. Genotyping of SMO and AKT1 is likely to be high yield in anterior skull base meningiomas with available surgical tissue.

AB Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer, but is nevertheless uncommon enough to have value as a signature cancer for some hereditary cancer syndromes. Commercial multigene testing panels include up to 13 different genes annotated for germline DNA testing of patients with endometrial cancer. Many other genes have been reported as relevant to familial endometrial cancer from directed genome-wide sequencing studies or multigene panel testing, or research. This review assesses the evidence supporting association with endometrial cancer risk for 32 genes implicated in hereditary endometrial cancer, and presents a summary of rare germline variants in these 32 genes detected by analysis of quasi-population-based endometrial cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. This comprehensive investigation has led to the conclusion that convincing evidence currently exists to support clinical testing of only six of these genes for diagnosis of hereditary endometrial cancer. Testing of endometrial cancer patients for the remaining genes should be considered in the context of research studies, as a means to better establish the level of endometrial cancer risk, if any, associated with genetic variants that are deleterious to gene or protein function. It is acknowledged that clinical testing of endometrial cancer patients for several genes included on commercial panels may provide actionable findings in relation to risk of other cancers, but these should be considered secondary or incidental findings and not conclusive evidence for diagnosis of inherited endometrial cancer. In summary, this review and analysis provides a comprehensive report of current evidence to guide the selection of genes for clinical and research gene testing of germline DNA from endometrial cancer patients.

AB Novel discoveries involving the evaluation of potential therapeutics are based on newly identified molecular targets for atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT), which are the most common form of infantile brain tumors. Central nervous system ATRTs are rare, aggressive, and fast growing tumors of the brain and spinal cord and carry a very poor prognosis. Currently, the standard of care for ATRT patients is based on surgical resection followed by systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which result in severe side effects. As protein tyrosine kinases have proven to be actionable targets that reduce tumor growth in a number of cancers, we examined how inhibiting tyrosine kinases affected ATRT tumor growth. Here, we examine the therapeutic efficacy of the broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor vatalanib in the treatment of ATRT. Vatalanib significantly reduced the growth of ATRT tumor cell lines, both in two-dimensional cell culture and in three-dimensional cell culture using a spheroid model. As vatalanib had a remarkable effect on the growth of ATRT, we decided to use a transcriptomic approach to therapy by examining new actionable targets, such as tyrosine kinases. Next-generation RNA-sequencing and NanoString data analysis showed a significant increase in PTK7 RNA expression levels in ATRT tumors. Inhibition of PTK7 by siRNA treatment significantly decreases the viability of ATRT patient-derived tumor cell lines.Implications: These studies provide the groundwork for future preclinical in vivo studies aiming to investigate the efficacy of PTK7 inhibition on ATRT tumor growth.

AB There have been advances in personalized therapy directed by molecular profiles in lung adenocarcinoma, but not in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The lack of actionable driver oncogenes in SCC has restricted the use of small-molecule inhibitors. Here, we show that SCC cell lines displayed differential sensitivities to belinostat, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor. Phosphoproteomic analysis of belinostat-treated SCC cells revealed significant downregulation of the MAPK pathway, along with the induction of apoptosis. In cisplatin-resistant cells that demonstrated aberrant MAPK activation, combined treatment with belinostat significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced ERK phosphorylation and exhibited strong synergistic cytotoxicity. Furthermore, belinostat transcriptionally upregulated the F-box proteins FBXO3 and FBXW10, which directly targeted son of sevenless (SOS), an upstream regulator of the MAPK pathway, for proteasome-mediated degradation. Supporting this, suppression of SOS/ERK pathway by belinostat could be abrogated by inhibiting proteasomal activity either with bortezomib or with siRNA knockdown of FBXO3/FBXW10. Taken together, these preclinical data offer a novel understanding of the epigenetic mechanism by which belinostat exerts its cytotoxicity and supports the combination with cisplatin in clinical settings for chemorefractory SCC tumors. © 2017 The Authors.
