AB We report the case of a woman who pursued direct access genetic testing and then presented with concerns regarding a positive test result for Long-QT syndrome. Although the result ultimately proved to be a false positive, this case illustrates that costs associated with follow-up of direct access genetic testing results can be non-trivial for both the patient and for health care systems. Here we raise policy questions regarding the appropriate distribution of these costs. We also discuss the possibility that, when confronted by a direct access genetic test result that reports high risk for one or more actionable diseases, a family physician might feel compelled to act out of a desire to avoid liability, even when information regarding the accuracy and validity of the testing were not easily accessible. This case outlines lessons that can easily be translated into clinical practice, not only by genetic counselors, but also by family physicians, medical specialists and members of the public.

AB PURPOSE: To assess content validity and patient and provider prioritization of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression, anxiety, fatigue, and alcohol use items in the context of clinical care for people living with HIV (PLWH), and to develop and assess new items as needed.; METHODS: We conducted concept elicitation interviews (n=161), item pool matching, prioritization focus groups (n=227 participants), and cognitive interviews (n=48) with English-speaking (~75%) and Spanish-speaking (~25%) PLWH from clinical sites in Seattle, San Diego, Birmingham, and Boston. For each domain we also conducted item review and prioritization with two HIV provider panels of 3-8 members each.; RESULTS: Among items most highly prioritized by PLWH and providers were those that included information regarding personal impacts of the concept being assessed, in addition to severity level. Items that addressed impact were considered most actionable for clinical care. We developed additional items addressing this. For depression we developed items related to suicide and other forms of self-harm, and for all domains we developed items addressing impacts PLWH and/or providers indicated were particularly relevant to clinical care. Across the 4 domains, 16 new items were retained for further psychometric testing.; CONCLUSION: PLWH and providers had priorities for what they believed providers should know to provide optimal care for PLWH. Incorporation of these priorities into clinical assessments used in clinical care of PLWH may facilitate patient-centered care.

AB OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to (1) compare 30- and 90-day mortality rates after esophagectomy, (2) compare drivers of 30- and 90-day mortality, and (3) examine whether 90-day mortality affects hospital rankings.; BACKGROUND: Operative mortality has traditionally been assessed at 30 days. Ninety-day mortality has been suggested as a more appropriate indicator of quality, particularly after complex cancer surgery.; METHODS: Esophagectomies for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Mortality rates were examined by patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and hospital procedural volume. Risk-adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models examined hospital performance for mortality.; RESULTS: A total of 15,796 esophagectomy patients at 977 hospitals were available for analysis. Ninety-day overall mortality was more than double the 30-day mortality (8.9% vs 4.2%; P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, while both 30- and 90-day mortality were associated with patient factors such as age, comorbidity, and hospital volume, only 90-day mortality was influenced by tumor- and management-related variables such as stage, tumor location, and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy. Hospital performance was examined as top 10%, middle 10% to 90%, and lowest 10% as ranked using risk-adjusted odds of mortality. There was moderate correlation between ranking based on 30- and 90-day mortality [weighted kappa = 0.45 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.52)]. Compared with 30-day mortality rankings, nearly 20% of hospitals changed their ranking category when 90-day mortality rankings were used.; CONCLUSIONS: Examination of 90-day mortality after esophagectomy reflects cancer patient management decisions and may provide actionable targets for quality improvement.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Major advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of neuroblastoma, and the role somatic alterations play in driving tumor growth, have led to improvements in risk-stratified therapy and have provided the rationale for targeted therapies. In this review, we highlight current risk-based treatment approaches and discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating recent genomic discoveries into the clinic.; RECENT FINDINGS: Significant progress in the treatment of neuroblastoma has been realized using risk-based treatment strategies. Outcome has improved for all patients, including those classified as high-risk, although survival remains poor for this cohort. Integration of whole-genome DNA copy number and comprehensive molecular profiles into neuroblastoma classification systems will allow more precise prognostication and refined treatment assignment. Promising treatments that include targeted systemic radiotherapy, pathway-targeted small molecules, and therapy targeted at cell surface molecules are being evaluated in clinical trials, and recent genomic discoveries in relapsed tumor samples have led to the identification of new actionable mutations.; SUMMARY: The integration of refined treatment stratification based on whole-genome profiles with therapeutics that target the molecular drivers of malignant behavior in neuroblastoma has the potential to dramatically improve survival, with decreased toxicity.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Central nervous system tumors represent the most common solid tumors in children and are a leading cause of cancer-related fatalities in this age group. Here, we provide an update on insights gained through molecular profiling of the most common malignant childhood brain tumors.; RECENT FINDINGS: Genomic profiling studies of medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (diffuse midline glioma, with H3-K27M mutation), have refined, if not redefined, the diagnostic classification and therapeutic stratification of patients with these tumors. They detail the substantial genetic heterogeneity across each disease type and, importantly, link genotypic information to clinical course. The most aggressive, treatment-resistant (and also treatment-sensitive) forms within each disease entity are identified, and their potentially actionable targets.; SUMMARY: Molecularly based classification of pediatric brain tumors provides a critical framework for the more precise stratification and treatment of children with brain tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To iteratively design a prototype of a computerized clinical knowledge summarization (CKS) tool aimed at helping clinicians finding answers to their clinical questions; and to conduct a formative assessment of the usability, usefulness, efficiency, and impact of the CKS prototype on physicians' perceived decision quality compared with standard search of UpToDate and PubMed.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mixed-methods observations of the interactions of 10 physicians with the CKS prototype vs. standard search in an effort to solve clinical problems posed as case vignettes.; RESULTS: The CKS tool automatically summarizes patient-specific and actionable clinical recommendations from PubMed (high quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews) and UpToDate. Two thirds of the study participants completed 15 out of 17 usability tasks. The median time to task completion was less than 10s for 12 of the 17 tasks. The difference in search time between the CKS and standard search was not significant (median=4.9 vs. 4.5m in). Physician's perceived decision quality was significantly higher with the CKS than with manual search (mean=16.6 vs. 14.4; p=0.036).; CONCLUSIONS: The CKS prototype was well-accepted by physicians both in terms of usability and usefulness. Physicians perceived better decision quality with the CKS prototype compared to standard search of PubMed and UpToDate within a similar search time. Due to the formative nature of this study and a small sample size, conclusions regarding efficiency and efficacy are exploratory. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been studied. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50). The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682. Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL. TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment. We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing. All tumor specimens were obtained before chemotherapy. In conclusion, BRAF V600E mutation is likely to result in resistance to pazopanib but may be a potentianally actionable mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic techniques in recent years have allowed the identification of many mutated genes important in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Together with cytogenetic aberrations, these gene mutations are powerful prognostic markers in AML and can be used to guide patient management, for example selection of optimal post-remission therapy. The mutated genes also hold promise as therapeutic targets themselves. We evaluated the applicability of a gene panel for the detection of AML mutations in a diagnostic molecular pathology laboratory.; METHODS: Fifty patient samples comprising 46 AML and 4 other myeloid neoplasms were accrued for the study. They consisted of 19 males and 31 females at a median age of 60years (range: 18-88years). A total of 54 genes (full coding exons of 15 genes and exonic hotspots of 39 genes) were targeted by 568 amplicons that ranged from 225 to 275bp. The combined coverage was 141kb in sequence length. Amplicon libraries were prepared by TruSight myeloid sequencing panel (Illumina, CA) and paired-end sequencing runs were performed on a MiSeq (Illumina) genome sequencer. Sequences obtained were analyzed by in-house bioinformatics pipeline, namely BWA-MEM, Samtools, GATK, Pindel, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor and a novel algorithm ITDseek.; RESULTS: The mean count of sequencing reads obtained per sample was 3.81 million and the mean sequencing depth was over 3000X. Seventy-seven mutations in 24 genes were detected in 37 of 50 samples (74%). On average, 2 mutations (range 1-5) were detected per positive sample. TP53 gene mutations were found in 3 out of 4 patients with complex and unfavorable cytogenetics. Comparing NGS results with that of conventional molecular testing showed a concordance rate of 95.5%. After further resolution and application of a novel bioinformatics algorithm ITDseek to aid the detection of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), the concordance rate was revised to 98.2%.; CONCLUSIONS: Gene panel testing by NGS approach was applicable for sensitive and accurate detection of actionable AML gene mutations in the clinical laboratory to individualize patient management. A novel algorithm ITDseek was presented that improved the detection of FLT3-ITD of varying length, position and at low allelic burden.

AB Oncogenic activations by mutations in key cancer genes such as EGFR and KRAS are frequently associated with human cancers. Molecular targeting of specific oncogenic mutations in human cancer is a major therapeutic inroad for anti-cancer drug therapy. In addition, progressive developments of oncogene mutations lead to drug resistance. Therefore, the ability to detect and continuously monitor key actionable oncogenic mutations is important to guide the use of targeted molecular therapies to improve long-term clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Current oncogenic mutation detection is based on direct sampling of cancer tissue by surgical resection or biopsy. Oncogenic mutations were recently shown to be detectable in circulating bodily fluids of cancer patients. This field of investigation, termed liquid biopsy, permits a less invasive means of assessing the oncogenic mutation profile of a patient. This paper will review the analytical strategies used to assess oncogenic mutations from biofluid samples. Clinical applications will also be discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: Biopsy for lung cancer diagnosis is usually done at a single site. But it is unclear that genetic information at one biopsy site represents that of other lesions and is sufficient for therapeutic decision making.; METHODS: Non-synonymous mutations and insertions/deletions of 16 genes containing actionable mutations, and intron 2 deletion polymorphism of Bcl2-like11 were analyzed in 41 primary tumor and metastatic lymph node (L/N) matched, pStage IIA~IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples using a next generation sequencing based technique.; RESULTS: A total of 249 mutations, including 213 non-synonymous mutations, 32 deletions, and four insertions were discovered. There was a higher chance of discovering non-synonymous mutations in the primary tumors than in the metastatic L/N (138 (64.8%) vs. 75 (35.2%)). In the primary tumors, 106 G > A:C > T transitions (76.8%) of 138 non-synonymous mutations were detected, whereas in the metastatic L/N, 44 (58.7%) of 75 were discovered. A total 24 (11.3%) out of 213 non-synonymous mutations were developed in the context of APOBEC signature. Of those, 21 (87.5%) was detected in the primary tumors and 4 (16.7%) was detected in the metastatic L/N. When the mutation profiles between primary tumor and metastatic L/N were compared, 13 (31.7%) of 41 cases showed discrepant mutation profile. There were no statistically significant differences in disease free survival and overall survival between groups showing identical mutation profiles and those with discrepancy between primary and metastatic L/N.; CONCLUSIONS: Genetic heterogeneity between the primary and L/N metastatic lesions is not infrequent finding to consider when interpreting genomic data based on the result of one site inspection. A large prospective study may be needed to evaluate the impact of genetic heterogeneity on the clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients.

AB Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a molecularly heterogeneous hepatobiliary neoplasm with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The incidence of this neoplasm is growing globally. One third of iCCA tumors are amenable to surgical resection, but most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages with chemotherapy as the only established standard of practice. No molecular therapies are currently available for the treatment of this neoplasm. The poor understanding of the biology of iCCA and the lack of known oncogenic addiction loops has hindered the development of effective targeted therapies. Studies with sophisticated animal models defined IDH mutation as the first gatekeeper in the carcinogenic process and led to the discovery of striking alternative cellular origins. RNA- and exome-sequencing technologies revealed the presence of recurrent novel fusion events (FGFR2 and ROS1 fusions) and somatic mutations in metabolic (IDH1/2) and chromatin-remodeling genes (ARID1A, BAP1). These latest advancements along with known mutations in KRAS/BRAF/EGFR and 11q13 high-level amplification have contributed to a better understanding of the landscape of molecular alterations in iCCA. More than 100 clinical trials testing molecular therapies alone or in combination with chemotherapy including iCCA patients have not reported conclusive clinical benefits. Recent discoveries have shown that up to 70% of iCCA patients harbor potential actionable alterations that are amenable to therapeutic targeting in early clinical trials. Thus, the first biomarker-driven trials are currently underway. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB The standard of care for first-tier clinical investigation of the etiology of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders is chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) for copy number variations (CNVs), often followed by gene(s)-specific sequencing searching for smaller insertion-deletions (indels) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to capture all classes of genetic variation in one experiment; however, the diagnostic yield for mutation detection of WGS compared to CMA, and other tests, needs to be established. In a prospective study we utilized WGS and comprehensive medical annotation to assess 100 patients referred to a paediatric genetics service and compared the diagnostic yield versus standard genetic testing. WGS identified genetic variants meeting clinical diagnostic criteria in 34% of cases, representing a 4-fold increase in diagnostic rate over CMA (8%) (p-value = 1.42e-05) alone and >2-fold increase in CMA plus targeted gene sequencing (13%) (p-value = 0.0009). WGS identified all rare clinically significant CNVs that were detected by CMA. In 26 patients, WGS revealed indel and missense mutations presenting in a dominant (63%) or a recessive (37%) manner. We found four subjects with mutations in at least two genes associated with distinct genetic disorders, including two cases harboring a pathogenic CNV and SNV. When considering medically actionable secondary findings in addition to primary WGS findings, 38% of patients would benefit from genetic counseling. Clinical implementation of WGS as a primary test will provide a higher diagnostic yield than conventional genetic testing and potentially reduce the time required to reach a genetic diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Data from a plethora of high-throughput sequencing studies is readily available to researchers, providing genetic variants detected in a variety of healthy and disease populations. While each individual cohort helps gain insights into polymorphic and disease-associated variants, a joint perspective can be more powerful in identifying polymorphisms, rare variants, disease-associations, genetic burden, somatic variants, and disease mechanisms.; DESCRIPTION: We have set up a Reference Variant Store (RVS) containing variants observed in a number of large-scale sequencing efforts, such as 1000 Genomes, ExAC, Scripps Wellderly, UK10K; various genotyping studies; and disease association databases. RVS holds extensive annotations pertaining to affected genes, functional impacts, disease associations, and population frequencies. RVS currently stores 400 million distinct variants observed in more than 80,000 human samples.; CONCLUSIONS: RVS facilitates cross-study analysis to discover novel genetic risk factors, gene-disease associations, potential disease mechanisms, and actionable variants. Due to its large reference populations, RVS can also be employed for variant filtration and gene prioritization.; AVAILABILITY: A web interface to public datasets and annotations in RVS is available at https://rvs.u.hpc.mssm.edu/.

AB BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the prevalences of diabetes and dementia are both increasing, particularly in older people. Rates of diabetes in people with dementia are between 13 and 20 %. Diabetes management and diabetic self-care may be adversely affected by the presence of dementia. There is a need to know what interventions work best in the management of diabetes in people living with dementia (PLWD) in different settings and at different stages of the dementia trajectory. The overall aim is to develop an explanatory account or programme theory about 'what works' in the management of diabetes in people in what context and to identify promising interventions that merit further evaluation.; METHODS/DESIGN: This study uses a realist approach including studies on the management of diabetes in older people, medication management, diabetes-related self-care, workforce issues and assessment and treatment. We will use an iterative, stakeholder driven, four-stage approach. Phase 1: development of initial programme theory/ies through a first scoping of the literature and consultation with key stakeholder groups (user/patient representatives, dementia-care providers, clinicians, diabetes and dementia researchers and diabetes specialists). Phase 2: systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories identified in phase 1. Phase 3: validation of programme theory/ies with a purposive sample of participants from phase 1. Phase 4: actionable recommendations for the management of diabetes in PLWD.; DISCUSSION: A realist synthesis of the evidence will provide a theoretical framework (i.e. an explanation of how interventions work, for whom, in what context and why) for practice and future research work that articulates the barriers and facilitators to effective management of diabetes in people with dementia. By providing possible explanations for the way in which interventions are thought to work and how change is achieved, it will demonstrate how to tailor an intervention to the setting and patient group. The propositions arising from the review will also inform the design of future intervention studies.; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number CRD42015020625.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients, clinicians, researchers and payers are seeking to understand the value of using genomic information (as reflected by genotyping, sequencing, family history or other data) to inform clinical decision-making. However, challenges exist to widespread clinical implementation of genomic medicine, a prerequisite for developing evidence of its real-world utility.; METHODS: To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health-funded IGNITE (Implementing GeNomics In pracTicE; www.ignite-genomics.org ) Network, comprised of six projects and a coordinating center, was established in 2013 to support the development, investigation and dissemination of genomic medicine practice models that seamlessly integrate genomic data into the electronic health record and that deploy tools for point of care decision making. IGNITE site projects are aligned in their purpose of testing these models, but individual projects vary in scope and design, including exploring genetic markers for disease risk prediction and prevention, developing tools for using family history data, incorporating pharmacogenomic data into clinical care, refining disease diagnosis using sequence-based mutation discovery, and creating novel educational approaches.; RESULTS: This paper describes the IGNITE Network and member projects, including network structure, collaborative initiatives, clinical decision support strategies, methods for return of genomic test results, and educational initiatives for patients and providers. Clinical and outcomes data from individual sites and network-wide projects are anticipated to begin being published over the next few years.; CONCLUSIONS: The IGNITE Network is an innovative series of projects and pilot demonstrations aiming to enhance translation of validated actionable genomic information into clinical settings and develop and use measures of outcome in response to genome-based clinical interventions using a pragmatic framework to provide early data and proofs of concept on the utility of these interventions. Through these efforts and collaboration with other stakeholders, IGNITE is poised to have a significant impact on the acceleration of genomic information into medical practice.

AB The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb, www.dgidb.org) is a web resource that consolidates disparate data sources describing drug-gene interactions and gene druggability. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface and a documented application programming interface (API) for querying these data. DGIdb was assembled through an extensive manual curation effort, reflecting the combined information of twenty-seven sources. For DGIdb 2.0, substantial updates have been made to increase content and improve its usefulness as a resource for mining clinically actionable drug targets. Specifically, nine new sources of drug-gene interactions have been added, including seven resources specifically focused on interactions linked to clinical trials. These additions have more than doubled the overall count of drug-gene interactions. The total number of druggable gene claims has also increased by 30%. Importantly, a majority of the unrestricted, publicly-accessible sources used in DGIdb are now automatically updated on a weekly basis, providing the most current information for these sources. Finally, a new web view and API have been developed to allow searching for interactions by drug identifiers to complement existing gene-based search functionality. With these updates, DGIdb represents a comprehensive and user friendly tool for mining the druggable genome for precision medicine hypothesis generation.  © The Author(s) 2015.

AB We describe Exome Cancer Test v1.0 (EXaCT-1), the first New York State-Department of Health-approved whole-exome sequencing (WES)-based test for precision cancer care. EXaCT-1 uses HaloPlex (Agilent) target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing (Illumina) of tumour and matched constitutional control DNA. We present a detailed clinical development and validation pipeline suitable for simultaneous detection of somatic point/indel mutations and copy-number alterations (CNAs). A computational framework for data analysis, reporting and sign-out is also presented. For the validation, we tested EXaCT-1 on 57 tumours covering five distinct clinically relevant mutations. Results demonstrated elevated and uniform coverage compatible with clinical testing as well as complete concordance in variant quality metrics between formalin-fixed paraffin embedded and fresh-frozen tumours. Extensive sensitivity studies identified limits of detection threshold for point/indel mutations and CNAs. Prospective analysis of 337 cancer cases revealed mutations in clinically relevant genes in 82% of tumours, demonstrating that EXaCT-1 is an accurate and sensitive method for identifying actionable mutations, with reasonable costs and time, greatly expanding its utility for advanced cancer care.

AB The Adaptive Multi-scale Prognostics and Health Management (AM-PHM) is a methodology designed to enable PHM in smart manufacturing systems. In application, PHM information is not yet fully utilized in higher-level decision-making in manufacturing systems. AM-PHM leverages and integrates lower-level PHM information such as from a machine or component with hierarchical relationships across the component, machine, work cell, and assembly line levels in a manufacturing system. The AM-PHM methodology enables the creation of actionable prognostic and diagnostic intelligence up and down the manufacturing process hierarchy. Decisions are then made with the knowledge of the current and projected health state of the system at decision points along the nodes of the hierarchical structure. To overcome the issue of exponential explosion of complexity associated with describing a large manufacturing system, the AM-PHM methodology takes a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach into describing the system and solving for an optimized policy. A description of the AM-PHM methodology is followed by a simulated industry-inspired example to demonstrate the effectiveness of AM-PHM.

AB Phyllodes tumors (PTs) and fibroadenomas (FAs) are fibroepithelial lesions (FELs) of the breast. Although mutations affecting exon 2 of MED12 are highly recurrent in FAs and PTs, TERT promoter hotspot mutations are frequently found in PTs but are vanishingly rare in FAs. Malignant transformation of benign PTs is well-documented, but the progression from FA to PT remains a matter of contention. Here we report on the somatic genetic alterations in multiple ipsilateral synchronous FELs (three FAs, one benign PT, and one malignant PT) occurring in the same patient. DNA samples extracted from each tumor and matched normal tissue were subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay. This analysis revealed MED12 mutations in all lesions. One FA and the benign PT harbored a MED12Gly44Val mutation, whereas another FA and the malignant PT displayed a MED12Gly44Asp mutation. The remaining FA had an independent distinct MED12Gly44Cys mutation. A formal clonality analysis suggested a clonal relationship between the FELs with identical MED12 mutations (P<0.05). A clonal TERT promoter hotspot mutation was identified exclusively in the malignant PT. The identification of distinct MED12 mutations in multifocal ipsilateral and synchronous FELs supports the notion that co-existing mammary fibroepithelial tumors can arise independently. Conversely, the co-existence of identical MED12 mutations indicates clonal relatedness among FAs and PTs, corroborating the hypothesis that FAs may constitute the substrate from which PTs develop. Our findings also support the notion that acquisition of TERT promoter mutations may drive the progression of FELs.

AB BACKGROUND: Mature adults (age 50-64) make up a large proportion of organ transplant recipients, and waiting list candidates yet are underrepresented in terms of actual donors. Understanding the reasons why mature adults fail to register as deceased organ donors is critical in achieving the goal of increasing the actionable supply of organs available for transplant. Conceptual models propose certain factors such as bodily integrity, ick (i.e., disgust), jinx (i.e., superstition), medical mistrust, salience, self-efficacy, and stake are associated with organ donation registration attitudes. Moreover, the age myth, or the belief that one's age prevents them from becoming an organ donor, was examined among mature adults between the ages of 50-64.; METHOD: An online survey was disseminated to mature adults (N=709).; RESULTS: Results indicated jinx, salience, self-efficacy, and stake each predicted organ donation attitudes among mature adults. Moreover, results indicated that age myth accounted for attitudes toward registering as an organ donor among non-registered mature adults after controlling for non-cognitive and vested interest constructs.; CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the age myth is negatively associated with attitudes toward registering as organ donors. The results are discussed with an emphasis on both the theoretical and practical implications of study findings. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The advent of next-generation sequencing, and its transition further into the clinic with the US Food and Drug Administration approval of a cystic fibrosis assay in 2013, have increased the speed and reduced the cost of DNA sequencing. Coupled with a historic ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States that human genes are not patentable, these events have caused a seismic shift in genetic testing in clinical medicine. More labs are offering genetic testing services; more multigene panels are available for gene testing; more genes and gene mutations are being identified; and more variants of uncertain significance, which may or may not be clinically actionable, have been found. All these factors, taken together, are increasing the complexity of clinical management. While these developments have led to a greater interest in genetic testing, risk assessment, and large-scale population screening, they also present unique challenges. The dilemma for clinicians is how best to understand and manage this rapidly growing body of information to improve patient care. With millions of genetic variants of potential clinical significance and thousands of genes associated with rare but well-established genetic conditions, the complexities of genetic data management clearly will require improved computerized clinical decision support tools, as opposed to continued reliance on traditional rote, memory-based medicine.

AB Information empowerment has been the greatest gain of genomics, yet it also poses serious threat to its survival, especially when the information is incidental. There may be an emerging consensus that actionable incidental findings be returned. But this has not been supported by any systematic review. Future directions are equally missing. These are significant gaps. To fill these gaps, an online search on PubMed and Genetics in Medicine website was conducted between 20th of August to 23rd of October, 2013; combining certain filters and phrases, such as 'return incidental findings'. Nineteen (19) articles were selected from an avalanche of results, and reviewed. The review confirms a majority support for return of clinically actionable findings. The result also shows that the support represents views of Northern Americans. Critical contributions of Africans, Asians and Europeans are missing in this discourse. I recommended studies in this direction.

AB Mental illness is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes.

AB To determine how the Rapid Assessment Process (RAP) can be adapted to evaluate the readiness of primary care clinics for acceptance and use of computerized clinical decision support (CDS) related to clinical management of working patients, we used a unique blend of ethnographic methods for gathering data. First, knowledge resources, which were prototypes of CDS content areas (diabetes, lower back pain, and asthma) containing evidence-based information, decision logic, scenarios and examples of use, were developed by subject matter experts. A team of RAP researchers then visited five clinic settings to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing CDS about the health of workers in general and the knowledge resources specifically. Methods included observations, semi-structured qualitative interviews and graphic elicitation interviews about the knowledge resources. We used both template and grounded hermeneutic approaches to data analysis. Preliminary results indicate that the methods succeeded in generating specific actionable recommendations for CDS design.

AB BACKGROUND: The morbidity and mortality conference (MMC) provides a valuable opportunity to review patient care processes and safety concerns, aligning with a growing quality improvement (QI) mandate. Yet the structure, processes, and aims of many MMCs are often ill-defined. This review summarizes strategies employed by medical, surgical, and critical care departments in the development of patient safety-centered MMCs.; METHODS: A structured narrative review of literature was conducted using combinations of the search terms "morbidity and mortality conference(s)," "morbidity and mortality meetings," or "morbidity and mortality round(s)." The titles and abstracts of 250 returned articles were screened; 76 articles were reviewed in full, with 32 meeting the full inclusion criteria.; RESULTS: The literature review elicited a number of methods used by medical, surgical, and critical care MMCs to emphasize QI and patient safety outcomes. A list of actionable changes made in each article was compiled. Five themes common to QI-centered MMCs were identified: (1) defining the role of the MMC, (2) involving stakeholders, (3) detecting and selecting appropriate cases for presentation, (4) structuring goal-directed discussion, and (5) forming recommendations and assigning follow-up. Innovative methods to pair adverse event screening with MMCs were superior to nonstructured voluntary reporting and case selection for overall morbidity detection. Structured case review, discussion, and follow-up were more likely to lead to implementing systems-based change, and interdisciplinary MMCs were associated with a greater likelihood of forming an action item.; CONCLUSION: The modern patient safety-centered MMC shares common themes of practices that can be adopted by institutions looking to create a venue for analysis of care processes, a platform to launch QI initiatives, and a culture of safety.

AB Purpose Owing to its exquisite chemotherapy sensitivity, most patients with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are cured with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, up to 30% of patients with advanced GCT exhibit cisplatin resistance, which requires intensive salvage treatment, and have a 50% risk of cancer-related death. To identify a genetic basis for cisplatin resistance, we performed whole-exome and targeted sequencing of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Methods Men with GCT who received a cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen and had available tumor tissue were eligible to participate in this study. Whole-exome sequencing or targeted exon-capture-based sequencing was performed on 180 tumors. Patients were categorized as cisplatin sensitive or cisplatin resistant by using a combination of postchemotherapy parameters, including serum tumor marker levels, radiology, and pathology at surgical resection of residual disease. Results TP53 alterations were present exclusively in cisplatin-resistant tumors and were particularly prevalent among primary mediastinal nonseminomas (72%). TP53 pathway alterations including MDM2 amplifications were more common among patients with adverse clinical features, categorized as poor risk according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) model. Despite this association, TP53 and MDM2 alterations predicted adverse prognosis independent of the IGCCCG model. Actionable alterations, including novel RAC1 mutations, were detected in 55% of cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Conclusion In GCT, TP53 and MDM2 alterations were associated with cisplatin resistance and inferior outcomes, independent of the IGCCCG model. The finding of frequent TP53 alterations among mediastinal primary nonseminomas may explain the more frequent chemoresistance observed with this tumor subtype. A substantial portion of cisplatin-resistant GCTs harbor actionable alterations, which might respond to targeted therapies. Genomic profiling of patients with advanced GCT could improve current risk stratification and identify novel therapeutic approaches for patients with cisplatin-resistant disease.

AB Elucidating the precise molecular events altered by disease-causing genetic variants represents a major challenge in translational bioinformatics. To this end, many studies have investigated the structural and functional impact of amino acid substitutions. Most of these studies were however limited in scope to either individual molecular functions or were concerned with functional effects (e.g. deleterious vs. neutral) without specifically considering possible molecular alterations. The recent growth of structural, molecular and genetic data presents an opportunity for more comprehensive studies to consider the structural environment of a residue of interest, to hypothesize specific molecular effects of sequence variants and to statistically associate these effects with genetic disease. In this study, we analyzed data sets of disease-causing and putatively neutral human variants mapped to protein 3D structures as part of a systematic study of the loss and gain of various types of functional attribute potentially underlying pathogenic molecular alterations. We first propose a formal model to assess probabilistically function-impacting variants. We then develop an array of structure-based functional residue predictors, evaluate their performance, and use them to quantify the impact of disease-causing amino acid substitutions on catalytic activity, metal binding, macromolecular binding, ligand binding, allosteric regulation and post-translational modifications. We show that our methodology generates actionable biological hypotheses for up to 41% of disease-causing genetic variants mapped to protein structures suggesting that it can be reliably used to guide experimental validation. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of disease-causing human variants mapping to protein structures are function-altering both in the presence and absence of stability disruption.

AB Today's healthcare organizations are facing significant demands with respect to managing population health, demonstrating value, and accepting risk for clinical outcomes across the continuum of care. The patient's environment outside the walls of the hospital and physician's office-and outside the electronic health record (EHR)-has a substantial impact on clinical care outcomes. The use of big data is key to understanding factors that affect the patient's health status and enhancing clinicians' ability to anticipate how the patient will respond to various therapies. Big data is essential to delivering sustainable, highquality, value-based healthcare, as well as to the success of new models of care such as clinically integrated networks (CINs) and accountable care organizations.Sentara Healthcare, based in Norfolk, Virginia, has been an early adopter of the technologies that have readied us for our big data journey: EHRs, telehealth-supported electronic intensive care units, and telehealth primary care support through MDLIVE. Although we would not say Sentara is at the cutting edge of the big data trend, it certainly is among the fast followers. Use of big data in healthcare is still at an early stage compared with other industries. Tools for data analytics are maturing, but traditional challenges such as heightened data security and limited human resources remain the primary focus for regional health systems to improve care and reduce costs. Sentara primarily makes actionable use of big data in our CIN, Sentara Quality Care Network, and at our health plan, Optima Health. Big data projects can be expensive, and justifying the expense organizationally has often been easier in times of crisis. We have developed an analytics strategic plan separate from but aligned with corporate system goals to ensure optimal investment and management of this essential asset.

AB Molecular insights into how chronic stress affects lung tumorigenesis may offer new routes to chemoprevention. In this study, we show that chronic stress in mice chemically or genetically initiated for lung cancer leads to the release of norepinephrine and other catecholamines, thereby promoting lung tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, norepinephrine induced phosphorylation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) through the beta-adrenergic receptor-PKA pathway. VDCC triggered calcium mobilization, thereby inducing activation of IGF-1R via exocytosis of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Mice expressing lung-specific IGF-1R exhibited accelerated lung tumor development in response to chronic stress. Notably, clinically approved antihypertensive drugs that block L-type VDCC prevented the effects of chronic stress or norepinephrine on the IGF2/IGF-1R signaling cascade, along with transformation of lung epithelial cells and lung tumor formation. Overall, our results identify an actionable mechanism to limit the effects of chronic stress on lung tumorigenesis.

AB A life course approach to ageing relies on maintaining participation rates in national birth cohorts and other long-term longitudinal studies. This reduces the risk of selective attrition biasing associations between lifetime risk factors and health outcomes in later life and ensures the studies remain as representative as possible of the original population. We report the participation patterns for a postal questionnaire and home visit at 68-69years of study members in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, the oldest and longest-running British birth cohort study. We investigated how participation varied by lifetime and recent contact, health status, previous clinical feedback and study engagement, taking account of prior socioeconomic and cognitive characteristics. Overall participation and home visit participation remained high (94 and 80%, respectively) and there were no gender differences. Participation was higher in those with higher levels of prior contact and lower in those with the poorest health status. Having previously received clinical feedback on actionable blood results was associated with reduced home visit participation but other forms of clinical feedback were not associated with subsequent participation. Activities that fostered study engagement were associated with increased home visit participation. These findings inform strategies to maintain participation in life course studies.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the USA and worldwide, and of the estimated 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year, over 30% are lung adenocarcinomas. The backbone of 1st-line systemic therapy in the metastatic setting, in the absence of an actionable oncogenic driver, is platinum-based chemotherapy. ATM and ATR are DNA damage signaling kinases activated at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and stalled and collapsed replication forks, respectively. ATM protein is lost in a number of cancer cell lines and ATR kinase inhibitors synergize with cisplatin to resolve xenograft models of ATM-deficient lung cancer. We therefore sought to determine the frequency of ATM loss in a tissue microarray (TMA) of lung adenocarcinoma. Here we report the validation of a commercial antibody (ab32420) for the identification of ATM by immunohistochemistry and estimate that 61 of 147 (41%, 95% CI 34%-50%) cases of lung adenocarcinoma are negative for ATM protein expression. As a positive control for ATM staining, nuclear ATM protein was identified in stroma and immune infiltrate in all evaluable cases. ATM loss in lung adenocarcinoma was not associated with overall survival. However, our preclinical findings in ATM-deficient cell lines suggest that ATM could be a predictive biomarker for synergy of an ATR kinase inhibitor with standard-of-care cisplatin. This could improve clinical outcome in 100,000's of patients with ATM-deficient lung adenocarcinoma every year.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization has the potential to advance the management of pediatric cancer and high-risk hematologic disease. The clinical integration of genome sequencing into standard clinical practice has been limited and the potential utility of genome sequencing to identify clinically impactful information beyond targetable alterations has been underestimated.; METHODS: The Precision in Pediatric Sequencing (PIPseq) Program at Columbia University Medical Center instituted prospective clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) for pediatric cancer and hematologic disorders at risk for treatment failure. We performed cancer whole exome sequencing (WES) of patient-matched tumor-normal samples and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of tumor to identify sequence variants, fusion transcripts, relative gene expression, and copy number variation (CNV). A directed cancer gene panel assay was used when sample adequacy was a concern. Constitutional WES of patients and parents was performed when a constitutionally encoded disease was suspected. Results were initially reviewed by a molecular pathologist and subsequently by a multi-disciplinary molecular tumor board. Clinical reports were issued to the ordering physician and posted to the patient's electronic medical record.; RESULTS: NGS was performed on tumor and/or normal tissue from 101 high-risk pediatric patients. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in 38% of patients, of which only 16% subsequently received matched therapy. In an additional 38% of patients, the genomic data provided clinically relevant information of diagnostic, prognostic, or pharmacogenomic significance. RNA-seq was clinically impactful in 37/65 patients (57%) providing diagnostic and/or prognostic information for 17 patients (26%) and identified therapeutic targets in 15 patients (23%). Known or likely pathogenic germline alterations were discovered in 18/90 patients (20%) with 14% having germline alternations in cancer predisposition genes. American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) secondary findings were identified in six patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating clinical NGS into pediatric hematology-oncology practice. Beyond the identification of actionable alterations, the ability to avoid ineffective/inappropriate therapies, make a definitive diagnosis, and identify pharmacogenomic modifiers is clinically impactful. Taking a more inclusive view of potential clinical utility, 66% of cases tested through our program had clinically impactful findings and samples interrogated with both WES and RNA-seq resulted in data that impacted clinical decisions in 75% of cases.

AB This era of groundbreaking scientific developments in high-resolution, high-throughput technologies is allowing the cost-effective collection and analysis of huge, disparate datasets on individual health. Proper data mining and translation of the vast datasets into clinically actionable knowledge will require the application of clinical bioinformatics. These developments have triggered multiple national initiatives in precision medicine-a data-driven approach centering on the individual. However, clinical implementation of precision medicine poses numerous challenges. Foremost, precision medicine needs to be contrasted with the powerful and widely used practice of evidence-based medicine, which is informed by meta-analyses or group-centered studies from which mean recommendations are derived. This "one size fits all" approach can provide inadequate solutions for outliers. Such outliers, which are far from an oddity as all of us fall into this category for some traits, can be better managed using precision medicine. Here, we argue that it is necessary and possible to bridge between precision medicine and evidence-based medicine. This will require worldwide and responsible data sharing, as well as regularly updated training programs. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for achieving clinical utility in precision medicine. We project that, through collection, analyses and sharing of standardized medically relevant data globally, evidence-based precision medicine will shift progressively from therapy to prevention, thus leading eventually to improved, clinician-to-patient communication, citizen-centered healthcare and sustained well-being.

AB BACKGROUND: Comprehensive genomic sequencing (CGS) has the potential to revolutionize precision medicine for cancer patients across the globe. However, to date large-scale genomic sequencing of cancer patients has been limited to Western populations. In order to understand possible ethnic and geographic differences and to explore the broader application of CGS to other populations, we sequenced a panel of 415 important cancer genes to characterize clinically actionable genomic driver events in 201 Japanese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).; METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing methods, we examined all exons of 415 known cancer genes in Japanese CRC patients (n=201) and evaluated for concordance among independent data obtained from US patients with CRC (n=108) and from The Cancer Genome Atlas-CRC whole exome sequencing (WES) database (n=224). Mutation data from non-hypermutated Japanese CRC patients were extracted and clustered by gene mutation patterns. Two different sets of genes from the 415-gene panel were used for clustering: 61 genes with frequent alteration in CRC and 26 genes that are clinically actionable in CRC.; RESULTS: The 415-gene panel is able to identify all of the critical mutations in tumor samples as well as WES, including identifying hypermutated tumors. Although the overall mutation spectrum of the Japanese patients is similar to that of the Western population, we found significant differences in the frequencies of mutations in ERBB2 and BRAF. We show that the 415-gene panel identifies a number of clinically actionable mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF that are not detected by hot-spot testing. We also discovered that 26% of cases have mutations in genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair pathway. Unsupervised clustering revealed that a panel of 26 genes can be used to classify the patients into eight different categories, each of which can optimally be treated with a particular combination therapy.; CONCLUSIONS: Use of a panel of 415 genes can reliably identify all of the critical mutations in CRC patients and this information of CGS can be used to determine the most optimal treatment for patients of all ethnicities.

AB The human androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Many forms of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) still rely on the AR for survival. Currently used antiandrogens face clinical limitations as drug resistance develops in patients over time since they all target the mutation-prone androgen binding site (ABS), where gain-of-function mutations eventually convert antagonists into agonists. With a significant number of reported distinct mutations located across the ABS, it is imperative to develop a prognostic platform which would equip clinicians with prior knowledge and actionable strategies if cases of previously unreported AR mutations are encountered. The goal of this study is to develop a theoretical approach that can predict such previously unreported AR mutants in response to current treatment options for PCa. The expected drug response by these mutants has been modeled using cheminformatics methodology. The corresponding QSAR pipeline has been created, which extracts key protein-ligand interactions and quantifies them by 4D molecular descriptors. The developed models reported with an accuracy reaching 90% and enable prediction of activation of AR mutants by its native ligand as well as assess whether known antiandrogens will act on them as agonists or antagonists. As a result, a previously uncharacterized mutant, T878G, has been predicted to be activated by the latest antiandrogen enzalutamide, and the corresponding experimental evaluation confirmed this prediction. Overall, the developed cheminformatics pipeline provides useful insights toward understanding the changing genomic landscape of advanced PCa.

AB BACKGROUND: Findings show that 5-10% of women with a diagnosis of breast cancer (BCa) have actionable genetic mutations. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for testing to detect BRCA1/2 mutations include personal history (PH) variables such as age of 45years or younger and a family history (FH) variables. Rates of FH documentation and overall rates of appropriate referral for genetic testing are low, ranging from about 30 to 60%. The authors hypothesized that an upfront FH documentation and inclusion of a genetics counselor in a multidisciplinary clinic (MDC) setting would increase rates of appropriate referral for genetic testing.; METHODS: The study enrolled 609 consecutive women with non-metastatic BCa seen in consultation between June 2012 and December 2015 at a multidisciplinary clinic. Rates of FH documentation and referral for genetic testing to detect BRCA1/2 mutations were assessed before and after inclusion of a genetic counselor in the MDC.; RESULTS: The rates of FH documentation and appropriate referral were 100 and 89%, respectively. Half (50%) of the patients had only FH-based indications for testing. All the patients with PH-based indications were referred. The inclusion of a genetic counselor significantly increased appropriate referral rates among those with only FH-based indications (62 vs. 92%) and overall (80 vs. 96%) (p<0.0001 for both). Among the 12% of the patients with actionable mutations, 60% were 45years of age or younger, whereas 30% had only FH-based testing indications.; CONCLUSIONS: This report shows substantially higher FH documentation and appropriate genetic testing rates than prior reports. Many patients with indications for genetic testing may have only FH-based indications for testing, and this subset may account for the sizable proportion of patients with newly diagnosed BCa who have actionable mutations.

AB BACKGROUND: About 10-15% of adult, and most pediatric, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) lack mutations in KIT, PDGFRA, SDHx, or RAS pathway components (KRAS, BRAF, NF1). The identification of additional mutated genes in this rare subset of tumors can have important clinical benefit to identify altered biological pathways and select targeted therapies.; METHODS: We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for coding regions in more than 300 cancer-related genes of 186 GISTs to assess for their somatic alterations.; RESULTS: We identified 24 GIST lacking alterations in the canonical KIT/PDGFRA/RAS pathways, including 12 without SDHx alterations. These 24 patients were mostly adults (96%). The tumors had a 46% rate of nodal metastases. These 24 GIST were more commonly mutated at 7 genes: ARID1B, ATR, FGFR1, LTK, SUFU, PARK2 and ZNF217. Two tumors harbored FGFR1 gene fusions (FGFR1-HOOK3, FGFR1-TACC1) and one harbored an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion that responded to TRK inhibition. In an independent sample set, we identified 5 GIST cases lacking alterations in the KIT/PDGFRA/SDHx/RAS pathways, including two additional cases with FGFR1-TACC1 and ETV6-NTRK3 fusions.; CONCLUSIONS: Using patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and CGP, we show that GIST lacking alterations in canonical genes occur in younger patients, frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, and most contain deleterious genomic alterations, including gene fusions involving FGFR1 and NTRK3. If confirmed in larger series, routine testing for these translocations may be indicated for this subset of GIST. Moreover, these findings can be used to guide personalized treatments for patients with GIST. Trial registration NCT 02576431. Registered October 12, 2015.

AB Anthropogenic climate change will likely increase diarrhea rates for communities with inadequate water, sanitation, or hygiene facilities including those with intermittent water supplies. Current approaches to study these impacts typically focus on the effect of temperature on all-cause diarrhea while excluding precipitation and diarrhea etiology while not providing actionable adaptation strategies. We develop a partially mechanistic, systems approach to estimate future diarrhea prevalence and design adaptation strategies. The model incorporates downscaled global climate models, water quality data, quantitative microbial risk assessment, and pathogen prevalence in an agent-based modeling framework incorporating precipitation and diarrhea etiology. It is informed using water quality and diarrhea data from Hubli-Dharwad, India-a city with an intermittent piped water supply exhibiting seasonal water quality variability vulnerable to climate change. We predict all-cause diarrhea prevalence to increase by 4.9% (Range: 1.5-9.0%) by 2011-2030, 11.9% (Range: 7.1-18.2%) by 2046-2065, and 18.2% (Range: 9.1-26.2%) by 2080-2099. Rainfall is an important modifying factor. Rotavirus prevalence is estimated to decline by 10.5% with Cryptosporidium and E. coli prevalence increasing by 9.9% and 6.3%, respectively, by 2080-2099 in this setting. These results suggest that ceramic water filters would be recommended as a climate adaptation strategy over chlorination. This work highlights the vulnerability of intermittent water supplies to climate change and the urgent need for improvements.

AB We completed targeted exome sequencing of the tumors of 50 patients with pTis-pT4b bladder cancer. Mutations were categorized by type, stratified against previously identified cancer loci in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases, and evaluated in pathway analysis and comutation plots. We analyzed mutation associations with receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nodal involvement, metastatic disease development, and survival. Compared with The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found higher mutation rates in genes encoding products involved in epigenetic regulation and cell cycle regulation. Of the pathways examined, PI3K/mTOR and Cell Cycle/DNA Repair exhibited the greatest frequencies of mutation. RB1 and TP53, as well as NF1 and PIK3CA were frequently comutated. We identified no association between mutations in specific genes and key clinical outcomes of interest when corrected for multiple testing. Discovery phase analysis of the somatic mutations in 50 high-risk bladder cancer patients revealed novel mutations and mutational patterns, which may be useful for developing targeted therapy regimens or new biomarkers for patients at very high risk of disease metastasis and death.; PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report we found known, as well as previously unreported, genetic mutations in the tumors of patients with high-risk bladder cancer. These mutations, if validated, may serve as actionable targets for new trials. Copyright © 2016 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmacogenomics aims to correlate inter-individual differences of drug efficacy and/or toxicity with the underlying genetic composition, particularly in genes encoding for protein factors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transport. In several European populations, particularly in countries with lower income, information related to the prevalence of pharmacogenomic biomarkers is incomplete or lacking. Here, we have implemented the microattribution approach to assess the pharmacogenomic biomarkers allelic spectrum in 18 European populations, mostly from developing European countries, by analyzing 1,931 pharmacogenomics biomarkers in 231 genes. Our data show significant inter-population pharmacogenomic biomarker allele frequency differences, particularly in 7 clinically actionable pharmacogenomic biomarkers in 7 European populations, affecting drug efficacy and/or toxicity of 51 medication treatment modalities. These data also reflect on the differences observed in the prevalence of high-risk genotypes in these populations, as far as common markers in the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, VKORC1, SLCO1B1 and TPMT pharmacogenes are concerned. Also, our data demonstrate notable differences in predicted genotype-based warfarin dosing among these populations. Our findings can be exploited not only to develop guidelines for medical prioritization, but most importantly to facilitate integration of pharmacogenomics and to support pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing. This may subsequently contribute towards significant cost-savings in the overall healthcare expenditure in the participating countries, where pharmacogenomics implementation proves to be cost-effective.

AB Encysted embryos (cysts) of the crustacean Artemia franciscana exhibit enormous tolerance to adverse conditions encompassing high doses of radiation, years of anoxia, desiccation and extreme salinity. So far, several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to this extremophilia, however, none were sought in the lipid profile of the cysts. Here in, we used high resolution shotgun lipidomics suited for detailed quantitation and analysis of lipids in uncharacterized biological membranes and samples and assembled the total, mitochondrial and mitoplastic lipidome of Artemia franciscana cysts. Overall, we identified and quantitated 1098 lipid species dispersed among 22 different classes and subclasses. Regarding the mitochondrial lipidome, most lipid classes exhibited little differences from those reported in other animals, however, Artemia mitochondria harboured much less phosphatidylethanolamine, plasmenylethanolamines and ceramides than mitochondria of other species, some of which by two orders of magnitude. Alternatively, Artemia mitochondria exhibited much higher levels of phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines. The identification and quantitation of the total and mitochondrial lipidome of the cysts may help in the elucidation of actionable extremophilia-affording proteins, such as the 'late embryogenesis abundant' proteins, which are known to interact with lipid membranes.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Effective treatments are urgently needed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is usually diagnosed at advanced stages. Signaling via the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway is aberrantly activated in HCC by IGF2 overexpression. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of IGF2 overexpression and its oncogenic activities and evaluate the anti-tumor effects of reducing IGF2 signaling.; METHODS: We obtained 228 HCC samples from patients who underwent liver resection, 168 paired non-tumor adjacent cirrhotic liver samples, and 10 non-tumor liver tissues from patients undergoing resection for hepatic hemangioma. We analyzed gene expression, microRNA, and DNA methylation profiles for all samples, focusing on genes in the IGF signaling pathway. IGF2 was expressed in SNU449 and PLC5 HCC cells and knocked down with small hairpin RNAs in Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines. We analyzed these cells for proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and colony formation. We performed studies in mice engineered to express Myc and Akt1 in liver, which develop liver tumors, with or without hepatic expression of Igf2. Mice with xenograft tumors grown from HCC cells were given a monoclonal antibody against IGF1 and IGF2 (xentuzumab), along with sorafenib; tumor growth was measured and tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblots.; RESULTS: Levels of IGF2 messenger RNA and protein were increased >20-fold in 15% of human HCC tissues compared with non-tumor liver tissues. Methylation at the fetal promoters of IGF2 was reduced in the HCC samples and cell lines that overexpressed IGF2, compared with those that did not overexpress this gene, and non-tumor tissues. Tumors that overexpressed IGF2 had gene expression patterns significantly associated with hepatic progenitor cell features, stellate cell activation, NOTCH signaling, and an aggressive phenotype (P < .0001). In mice engineered to express Myc and Akt1 in liver, co-expression of Igf2 accelerated formation of liver tumors, compared to mice with livers expressing only Myc and Akt1, and shortened survival times (P= .02). The antibody xentuzumab blocked phosphorylation of IGF1 receptor in HCC cell lines and reduced their proliferation and colony formation. In mice with xenograft tumors, injection of xentuzumab, with or without sorafenib, slowed tumor growth and increased survival times compared to vehicle or sorafenib alone. Xentuzumab inhibited phosphorylation of IGF1 receptor and AKT and reduced decreased tumor vascularization compared with vehicle.; CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of HCC samples were found to overexpress IGF2, via demethylation of its fetal promoter. Overexpression of IGF2 accelerates formation of liver tumors in mice with hepatic expression of MYC and AKT1, via activation of IGF1 receptor signaling. An antibody against IGF1 and IGF2 slows growth of xenograft tumors and increases survival of these mice. Copyright A© 2016 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: Genome and exome sequencing can identify variants unrelated to the primary goal of sequencing. Detecting pathogenic variants associated with an increased risk of a medical disorder enables clinical interventions to improve future health outcomes in patients and their at-risk relatives. The Clinical Genome Resource, or ClinGen, aims to assess clinical actionability of genes and associated disorders as part of a larger effort to build a central resource of information regarding the clinical relevance of genomic variation for use in precision medicine and research.; METHODS: We developed a practical, standardized protocol to identify available evidence and generate qualitative summary reports of actionability for disorders and associated genes. We applied a semiquantitative metric to score actionability.; RESULTS: We generated summary reports and actionability scores for the 56 genes and associated disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for return as secondary findings from clinical genome-scale sequencing. We also describe the challenges that arose during the development of the protocol that highlight important issues in characterizing actionability across a range of disorders.; CONCLUSION: The ClinGen framework for actionability assessment will assist research and clinical communities in making clear, efficient, and consistent determinations of actionability based on transparent criteria to guide analysis and reporting of findings from clinical genome-scale sequencing.Genet Med 18 12, 1258-1268.

AB We report here a simple yet robust transient compartmentalization system for microfluidic platforms. Cylindrical microfilaments made of commercially available fishing lines are embedded in a microfluidic chamber and employed as removable walls, dividing the chamber into several compartments. These partitions allow tight sealing for hours, and can be removed at any time by longitudinal sliding with minimal hydrodynamic perturbation. This allows the easy implementation of various functions, previously impossible or requiring more complex instrumentation. In this study, we demonstrate the applications of our strategy, firstly to trigger chemical diffusion, then to make surface co-coating or cell co-culture on a two-dimensional substrate, and finally to form multiple cell-laden hydrogel compartments for three-dimensional cell co-culture in a microfluidic device. This technology provides easy and low-cost solutions, without the use of pneumatic valves or external equipment, for constructing well-controlled microenvironments for biochemical and cellular assays.

AB Sequencing-based breast cancer diagnostics have the potential to replace routine biomarkers and provide molecular characterization that enable personalized precision medicine. Here we investigate the concordance between sequencing-based and routine diagnostic biomarkers and to what extent tumor sequencing contributes clinically actionable information. We applied DNA- and RNA-sequencing to characterize tumors from 307 breast cancer patients with replication in up to 739 patients. We developed models to predict status of routine biomarkers (ER, HER2,Ki-67, histological grade) from sequencing data. Non-routine biomarkers, including mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ERBB2(HER2), and additional clinically actionable somatic alterations were also investigated. Concordance with routine diagnostic biomarkers was high for ER status (AUC=0.95;AUC(replication)=0.97) and HER2 status (AUC=0.97;AUC(replication)=0.92). The transcriptomic grade model enabled classification of histological grade 1 and histological grade 3 tumors with high accuracy (AUC=0.98;AUC(replication)=0.94). Clinically actionable mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ERBB2(HER2) were detected in 5.5% of patients, while 53% had genomic alterations matching ongoing or concluded breast cancer studies. Sequencing-based molecular profiling can be applied as an alternative to histopathology to determine ER and HER2 status, in addition to providing improved tumor grading and clinically actionable mutations and molecular subtypes. Our results suggest that sequencing-based breast cancer diagnostics in a near future can replace routine biomarkers.

AB BACKGROUND. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient's cancer can be used to diagnose, monitor, and recommend treatment. Clinical implementation of tumor profiling in an enterprise-wide, unselected cancer patient population has yet to be reported. METHODS. We deployed a hybrid-capture and massively parallel sequencing assay (OncoPanel) for all adult and pediatric patients at our combined cancer centers. Results were categorized by pathologists based on actionability. We report the results for the first 3,727 patients tested. RESULTS. Our cohort consists of cancer patients unrestricted by disease site or stage. Across all consented patients, half had sufficient and available (>20% tumor) material for profiling; once specimens were received in the laboratory for pathology review, 73% were scored as adequate for genomic testing. When sufficient DNA was obtained, OncoPanel yielded a result in 96% of cases. 73% of patients harbored an actionable or informative alteration; only 19% of these represented a current standard of care for therapeutic stratification. The findings recapitulate those of previous studies of common cancers but also identify alterations, including in AXL and EGFR, associated with response to targeted therapies. In rare cancers, potentially actionable alterations suggest the utility of a "cancer-agnostic" approach in genomic profiling. Retrospective analyses uncovered contextual genomic features that may inform therapeutic response and examples where diagnoses revised by genomic profiling markedly changed clinical management. CONCLUSIONS. Broad sequencing-based testing deployed across an unselected cancer cohort is feasible. Genomic results may alter management in diverse scenarios; however, additional barriers must be overcome to enable precision cancer medicine on a large scale. FUNDING.

AB The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a serious global challenge. Here, we studied prospectively whether bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for real-time MDR surveillance is technical feasible, returns actionable results, and is cost-beneficial. WGS was applied to all MDR isolates of four species (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, MDR Escherichia coli, and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa) at the University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany, a tertiary care hospital with 1,450 beds, during two 6-month intervals. Turnaround times (TAT) were measured, and total costs for sequencing per isolate were calculated. After cancelling prior policies of preemptive isolation of patients harboring certain Gram-negative MDR bacteria in risk areas, the second interval was conducted. During interval I, 645 bacterial isolates were sequenced. From culture, TATs ranged from 4.4 to 5.3 days, and costs were 202.49 per isolate. During interval II, 550 bacterial isolates were sequenced. Hospital-wide transmission rates of the two most common species (MRSA and MDR E. coli) were low during interval I (5.8% and 2.3%, respectively) and interval II (4.3% and 5.0%, respectively). Cancellation of isolation of patients infected with non-pan-resistant MDR E. coli in risk wards did not increase transmission. Comparing sequencing costs with avoided costs mostly due to fewer blocked beds during interval II, we saved in excess of 200,000. Real-time microbial WGS in our institution was feasible, produced precise actionable results, helped us to monitor transmission rates that remained low following a modification in isolation procedures, and ultimately saved costs.

AB The use of Internet-based sources of information for health surveillance applications has increased in recent years, as a greater share of social and media activity happens through online channels. The potential surveillance value in online sources of information about emergent health events include early warning, situational awareness, risk perception and evaluation of health messaging among others. The challenge in harnessing these sources of data is the vast number of potential sources to monitor and developing the tools to translate dynamic unstructured content into actionable information. In this paper we investigated the use of one social media outlet, Twitter, for surveillance of avian influenza risk in North America. We collected AI-related messages over a five-month period and compared these to official surveillance records of AI outbreaks. A fully automated data extraction and analysis pipeline was developed to acquire, structure, and analyze social media messages in an online context. Two methods of outbreak detection; a static threshold and a cumulative-sum dynamic threshold; based on a time series model of normal activity were evaluated for their ability to discern important time periods of AI-related messaging and media activity. Our findings show that peaks in activity were related to real-world events, with outbreaks in Nigeria, France and the USA receiving the most attention while those in China were less evident in the social media data. Topic models found themes related to specific AI events for the dynamic threshold method, while many for the static method were ambiguous. Further analyses of these data might focus on quantifying the bias in coverage and relation between outbreak characteristics and detectability in social media data. Finally, while the analyses here focused on broad themes and trends, there is likely additional value in developing methods for identifying low-frequency messages, operationalizing this methodology into a comprehensive system for visualizing patterns extracted from the Internet, and integrating these data with other sources of information such as wildlife, environment, and agricultural data.

AB BACKGROUND: Research suggests that multidisciplinary genomic tumor boards (MGTB) can inform cancer patient care, though little is known about factors influencing how MGTBs interpret genomic test results, make recommendations, and perceive the utility of this approach. This study's objective was to observe, describe, and assess the establishment of the Breast Multidisciplinary Genomic Tumor Board, the first MGTB focused on interpreting genomic test results for breast cancer patients with advanced disease.; METHODS: We conducted a qualitative case study involving participant observation at monthly MGTB meetings from October 2013 through November 2014 and interviews with 12 MGTB members. We analyzed social dynamics and interactions within the MGTB regarding interpretation of genomic findings and participants' views on effectiveness of the MGTB in using genomics to inform patient care.; RESULTS: Twenty-two physicians, physician-scientists, basic scientists, bioethicists, and allied care professionals comprised the MGTB. The MGTB reviewed FoundationOne results for 40 metastatic breast cancer patients. Based on findings, the board mostly recommended referring patients to clinical trials (34) and medical genetics (15), and Food and Drug Administration-approved (FDA) breast cancer therapies (13). Though multidisciplinary, recommendations were driven by medical oncologists. Interviewees described providing more precise care recommendations and professional development as advantages and the limited actionability of genomic test results as a challenge for the MGTB.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest both feasibility and desirability of pooling professional expertise in genomically-guided breast cancer care and challenges to institutionalizing a Breast MGTB, specifically in promoting interdisciplinary contributions and managing limited actionability of genomic test results for patients with advanced disease.

AB Adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a diagnostic context raises numerous questions with regard to identification and reports of secondary variants (SVs) in actionable genes. To better understand the whys and wherefores of these questioning, it is necessary to understand how they are selected during the filtering process and how their proportion can be estimated. It is likely that SVs are underestimated and that our capacity to label all true SVs can be improved. In this context, Locus-specific databases (LSDBs) can be key by providing a wealth of information and enabling classifying variants. We illustrate this issue by analyzing 318 SVs in 23 actionable genes involved in cancer susceptibility syndromes identified through sequencing of 572 participants selected for a range of atherosclerosis phenotypes. Among these 318 SVs, only 43.4% are reported in Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional versus 71.4% in LSDB. In addition, 23.9% of HGMD Professional variants are reported as pathogenic versus 4.8% for LSDB. These data underline the benefits of LSDBs to annotate SVs and minimize overinterpretation of mutations thanks to their efficient curation process and collection of unpublished data. © 2016 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

AB High-throughput next-generation sequencing such as whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing are being rapidly integrated into clinical practice. The use of these techniques leads to the identification of secondary variants for which decisions about the reporting or not to the patient need to be made. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently published recommendations for the reporting of these variants in clinical practice for 56 "actionable" genes. Among these, seven are involved in Marfan Syndrome And Related Disorders (MSARD) resulting from mutations of the FBN1, TGFBR1 and 2, ACTA2, SMAD3, MYH11 and MYLK genes. Here, we show that mutations collected in UMD databases for MSARD genes (UMD-MSARD) are rarely reported, including the most frequent ones, in global scale initiatives for variant annotation such as the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and ClinVar. The predicted pathogenic mutations reported in global scale initiatives but absent in locus-specific databases (LSDBs) mainly correspond to rare events. UMD-MSARD databases are therefore the only resources providing access to the full spectrum of known pathogenic mutations. They are the most comprehensive resources for clinicians and geneticists to interpret MSARD-related variations not only primary variants but also secondary variants. © 2016 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

AB OBJECTIVE: As health technology assessment (HTA) organizations in Canada and around the world seek to involve the public and patients in their activities, frameworks to guide decisions about whom to involve, through which mechanisms, and at what stages of the HTA process have been lacking. The aim of this study was to describe the development and outputs of a comprehensive framework for involving the public and patients in a government agency's HTA process.; METHODS: The framework was informed by a synthesis of international practice and published literature, a dialogue with local, national and international stakeholders, and the deliberations of a government agency's public engagement subcommittee in Ontario, Canada.; RESULTS: The practice and literature synthesis failed to identify a single, optimal approach to involving the public and patients in HTA. Choice of methods should be considered in the context of each HTA stage, goals for incorporating societal and/or patient perspectives into the process, and relevant societal and/or patient values at stake. The resulting framework is structured around four actionable elements: (i) guiding principles and goals for public and patient involvement (PPI) in HTA, (ii) the establishment of a common language to support PPI efforts, (iii) a flexible array of PPI approaches, and (iv) on-going evaluation of PPI to inform adjustments over time.; CONCLUSIONS: A public and patient involvement framework has been developed for implementation in a government agency's HTA process. Core elements of this framework may apply to other organizations responsible for HTA and health system quality improvement.

AB Genomic microarray may detect susceptibility loci (SL) for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and epilepsy, with a yet unquantifiable risk for the fetus. The prenatal disclosure of susceptibility loci is a topic of much debate. Many health care professionals fear that reporting susceptibility loci may put a psychological burden on pregnant couples. It is our policy to disclose prenatal susceptibility loci as we recognize them as actionable for prospective parents. The aim of this report was to evaluate the psychological impact of disclosing a prenatal diagnosis of susceptibility loci. The psychological impact of disclosing susceptibility loci was evaluated in the first patients who received such results. Eight out of 15 women who had a susceptibility locus disclosed and four of their partners consented to share their experiences through a telephonic evaluation (n=12). Follow-up time ranged from 3 to 15months after their prenatal test result. The reporting of susceptibility loci was initially 'shocking' for five parents while the other seven felt 'worried'. Ten out of 12 participants indicated they would like to be informed about the susceptibility locus again, two were unsure. Most had no enduring worries. Participants unanimously indicated that pregnant couples should have an individualized pre-test choice about susceptibility loci (non)disclosure. We observed no negative psychological impact with the prenatal diagnosis and disclosure of SL on participants. A key factor in mitigating parental anxiety with SL disclosure appears to be post-test genetic counseling. Our report confirms that pregnant women and their partners prefer an individualized choice regarding the scope of prenatal testing.

AB Squamous cell lung cancer (sqCLC) is an aggressive form of cancer that poses many therapeutic challenges. Patients tend to be older, present at a later stage, and have a high incidence of comorbidities, which can compromise treatment delivery and exacerbate toxicity. In addition, certain agents routinely available for nonsquamous cell histologic subtypes, such as bevacizumab and pemetrexed, are contraindicated or lack efficacy in sqCLC. Therapeutic progress has been much slower for advanced sqCLC, with median survival times of approximately 9 to 11 months in most studies. Herein, we discuss the current therapeutic landscape for patients with sqCLC versus with nonsquamous NSCLC. Current evidence indicates that new targeted treatments, notably monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and necitumumab, and immunotherapies such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab can provide survival prolongation, although the benefits are still relatively modest. These incremental improvements, all realized since 2012, in aggregate, will very likely have a clinically meaningful impact for patients with sqCLC. We also discuss recent genomic studies of sqCLC that have identified potentially actionable molecular targets, as well as the relevant targeted agents in clinical development. Finally, we discuss the magnitude of survival benefit and the risk-to-benefit ratio that would prove clinically meaningful in this underserved patient population with unmet needs.

AB Oncogenic mutations in the gene KRAS are commonly detected in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This disease is inherently difficult to treat, and combinations involving platinum-based drugs remain the therapeutic mainstay. In terms of novel, pharmacologically actionable targets, nitric oxide synthases (NOS) have been implicated in the etiology of KRAS-driven cancers, including lung cancer, and small molecular weight NOS inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of other diseases. Thus, we evaluated the anti-neoplastic activity of the oral NOS inhibitor L-NAME in a randomized preclinical trial using a genetically engineered mouse model of Kras and p53 mutation-positive NSCLC. We report here that L-NAME decreased lung tumor growth in vivo, as assessed by sequential radiological imaging, and provided a survival advantage, perhaps the most difficult clinical parameter to improve upon. Moreover, L-NAME enhanced the therapeutic benefit afforded by carboplatin chemotherapy, provided it was administered as maintenance therapy after carboplatin. Collectively, these results support the clinical evaluation of L-NAME for the treatment of KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC.

AB BACKGROUND: Detailed spatial understanding of levels and trends in under-5 mortality is needed to improve the targeting of interventions to the areas of highest need, and to understand the sources of variation in mortality. To improve this understanding, we analysed local-level information on child mortality across sub-Saharan Africa between 1980-2010.; METHODS: We used data from 82 Demographic and Health Surveys in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, including the location and timing of 3·24 million childbirths and 393 685 deaths, to develop high-resolution spatial maps of under-5 mortality in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These estimates were at a resolution of 0·1 degree latitude by 0·1 degree longitude (roughly 10 km * 10 km). We then analysed this spatial information to distinguish within-country versus between-country sources of variation in mortality, to examine the extent to which declines in mortality have been accompanied by convergence in the distribution of mortality, and to study localised drivers of mortality differences, including temperature, malaria burden, and conflict.; FINDINGS: In our sample of sub-Saharan African countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, within-country differences in under-5 mortality accounted for 74-78% of overall variation in under-5 mortality across space and over time. Mortality differed significantly across only 8-15% of country borders, supporting the role of local, rather than national, factors in driving mortality patterns. We found that by the end of the study period, 23% of the eligible children in the study countries continue to live in mortality hotspots-areas where, if current trends continue, the Sustainable Developent Goals mortality targets will not be met. In multivariate analysis, within-country mortality levels at each pixel were significantly related to local temperature, malaria burden, and recent history of conflict.; INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that sub-national determinants explain a greater portion of under-5 mortality than do country-level characteristics. Sub-national measures of child mortality could provide a more accurate, and potentially more actionable, portrayal of where and why children are still dying than can national statistics.; FUNDING: The Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed and refractory solid tumors have a poor prognosis. Recent advances in genomic technology have made it feasible to screen tumors for actionable mutations, with the anticipation that this may provide benefit to patients.; METHODS: Pediatric oncologists were emailed an anonymous 34-question survey assessing their willingness to offer a rebiopsy to patients with relapsed disease for the purpose of tumor genomic profiling. They were presented with two scenarios evaluating morbidity and invasiveness of the procedures using the clinical examples of medulloblastoma and Ewing sarcoma.; RESULTS: A total of 195 pediatric oncologists responded to the questionnaire. Morbidity and invasiveness of the procedure demonstrated significant differences in provider willingness to refer their patients for rebiopsy. The pretest probability was a major variable influencing provider willingness to offer a rebiopsy. Respondents were more likely to offer a rebiopsy if the likelihood was high that the results would have an impact on clinical management than if the biopsy was for histologic confirmation alone (mean 89 vs. 56%; p=0.017). Compared with the rate of a rebiopsy for histologic confirmation, significantly fewer providers were willing to offer a rebiopsy if they were led to believe the likelihood of finding an actionable mutation was low (mean 45 vs. 56%; p=0.021).; CONCLUSION: The scenario showed that the pretest probability of finding an actionable mutation was influential in determining provider willingness to offer a rebiopsy for the purpose of tumor genomic profiling. Further research is warranted to evaluate the benefit of tumor genomic profiling in terms of patient outcomes.

AB INTRODUCTION: Next-generation sequencing and advances in 'omics technology have rapidly increased our understanding of the molecular landscape of epithelial ovarian cancers. Areas covered: Once characterized only by histologic appearance and clinical behavior, we now understand many of the molecular phenotypes that underlie the different ovarian cancer subtypes. While the current approach to treatment involves standard cytotoxic therapies after cytoreductive surgery for all ovarian cancers regardless of histologic or molecular characteristics, focus has shifted beyond a 'one size fits all' approach to ovarian cancer. Expert commentary: Genomic profiling offers potentially 'actionable' opportunities for development of targeted therapies and a more individualized approach to treatment with concomitant improved outcomes and decreased toxicity.

AB PURPOSE: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be used as a powerful diagnostic tool as well as for screening, but it may lead to anxiety, unnecessary testing, and overtreatment. Current guidelines suggest reporting clinically actionable secondary findings when diagnostic testing is performed. We examined preferences for receiving WGS results.; METHODS: A US nationally representative survey (n = 410 adults) was used to rank preferences for who decides (an expert panel, your doctor, you) which WGS results are reported. We estimated the value of information about variants with varying levels of clinical usefulness by using willingness to pay contingent valuation questions.; RESULTS: The results were as follows: 43% preferred to decide themselves what information is included in the WGS report. 38% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33-43%) would not pay for actionable variants, and 3% (95% CI: 1-5%) would pay more than $1,000. 55% (95% CI: 50-60%) would not pay for variants for which medical treatment is currently unclear, and 7% (95% CI: 5-9%) would pay more than $400.; CONCLUSION: Most people prefer to decide what WGS results are reported. Despite valuing actionable information more, some respondents perceive that genetic information could negatively impact them. Preference heterogeneity for WGS information should be considered in the development of policies, particularly to integrate patient preferences with personalized medicine and shared decision making.Genet Med 18 12, 1295-1302.

AB With increasing diffusion of EHR technology over the last half decade, clinician burnout is rising. As healthcare is a complex and highly regulated field, the rapid and mass adoption of EHR technology has created disruption for highly skilled workers such as clinicians. Although, much has been written about dissatisfaction with the EHR (electronic health record), a paucity of immediate solutions exists in the literature. This article suggests three actionable steps health systems and clinicians can make to expedite gains from and mitigate the effect of the EHR on clinical practice.

AB Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is prevalent in the military. The course of recovery can be highly variable. This study investigates whether deployment-acquired mTBI is associated with subsequent presence and severity of post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and identifies predictors of persistent PCS among US Army personnel who sustained mTBI while deployed to Afghanistan. We used data from a prospective longitudinal survey of soldiers assessed 1-2 months before a 10-month deployment to Afghanistan (T0), on redeployment to the United States (T1), approximately 3 months later (T2), and approximately 9 months later (T3). Outcomes of interest were PCS at T2 and T3. Predictors considered were: sociodemographic factors, number of previous deployments, pre-deployment mental health and TBI history, and mTBI and other military-related stress during the index deployment. The study sample comprised 4518 soldiers, 822 (18.2%) of whom experienced mTBI during the index deployment. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and deployment-related factors, deployment-acquired mTBI was associated with nearly triple the risk of reporting any PCS and with increased severity of PCS when symptoms were present. Among those who sustained mTBI, severity of PCS at follow-up was associated with history of pre-deployment TBI(s), pre-deployment psychological distress, more severe deployment stress, and loss of consciousness or lapse of memory (versus being "dazed" only) as a result of deployment-acquired mTBI. In summary, we found that sustaining mTBI increases risk for persistent PCS. Previous TBI(s), pre-deployment psychological distress, severe deployment stress, and loss of consciousness or lapse of memory resulting from mTBI(s) are prognostic indicators of persistent PCS after an index mTBI. These observations may have actionable implications for prevention of chronic sequelae of mTBI in the military and other settings.

AB In populations that have not been selected for family history of disease, it is unclear how commonly pathogenic variants (PVs) in disease-associated genes for rare Mendelian conditions are found and how often they are associated with clinical features of these conditions. We conducted independent, prospective analyses of participants in two community-based epidemiological studies to test the hypothesis that persons carrying PVs in any of 56 genes that lead to 24 dominantly inherited, actionable conditions are more likely to exhibit the clinical features of the corresponding diseases than those without PVs. Among 462 European American Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and 3223 African-American Jackson Heart Study (JHS) participants who were exome-sequenced, we identified and classified 642 and 4429 unique variants, respectively, in these 56 genes while blinded to clinical data. In the same participants, we ascertained related clinical features from the participants' clinical history of cancer and most recent echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and lipid measurements, without knowledge of variant classification. PVs were found in 5 FHS (1.1%) and 31 JHS (1.0%) participants. Carriers of PVs were more likely than expected, on the basis of incidence in noncarriers, to have related clinical features in both FHS (80.0% versus 12.4%) and JHS (26.9% versus 5.4%), yielding standardized incidence ratios of 6.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7 to 16.5; P = 7 * 10-4) in FHS and 4.7 (95% CI, 1.9 to 9.7; P = 3 * 10-4) in JHS. Individuals unselected for family history who carry PVs in 56 genes for actionable conditions have an increased aggregated risk of developing clinical features associated with the corresponding diseases.

AB The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text-found in biomedical publications and clinical notes-is an important component of genotype and phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in the eventual realization of precision medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: To truly achieve personalized medicine in oncology, it is critical to catalog and curate cancer sequence variants for their clinical relevance. The Somatic Working Group (WG) of the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), in cooperation with ClinVar and multiple cancer variant curation stakeholders, has developed a consensus set of minimal variant level data (MVLD). MVLD is a framework of standardized data elements to curate cancer variants for clinical utility. With implementation of MVLD standards, and in a working partnership with ClinVar, we aim to streamline the somatic variant curation efforts in the community and reduce redundancy and time burden for the interpretation of cancer variants in clinical practice.; METHODS: We developed MVLD through a consensus approach by i) reviewing clinical actionability interpretations from institutions participating in the WG, ii) conducting extensive literature search of clinical somatic interpretation schemas, and iii) survey of cancer variant web portals. A forthcoming guideline on cancer variant interpretation, from the Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP), can be incorporated into MVLD.; RESULTS: Along with harmonizing standardized terminology for allele interpretive and descriptive fields that are collected by many databases, the MVLD includes unique fields for cancer variants such as Biomarker Class, Therapeutic Context and Effect. In addition, MVLD includes recommendations for controlled semantics and ontologies. The Somatic WG is collaborating with ClinVar to evaluate MVLD use for somatic variant submissions. ClinVar is an open and centralized repository where sequencing laboratories can report summary-level variant data with clinical significance, and ClinVar accepts cancer variant data.; CONCLUSIONS: We expect the use of the MVLD to streamline clinical interpretation of cancer variants, enhance interoperability among multiple redundant curation efforts, and increase submission of somatic variants to ClinVar, all of which will enhance translation to clinical oncology practice.

AB OBJECTIVES: Which design features of nutrition infographics make them memorable and compelling?; METHODS: First, we conducted 3 focus groups with a total of 28 participants to understand preferred infographic characteristics of adults who were mostly in their early 20s. Second, using between subject design, a slide show of single-image infographics was displayed to an independent sample of college students and young career university employees (N = 50). We assigned participants randomly to either active or passive processing conditions. We conducted correlation and regression analyses to examine differences in recall and intention by infographic characteristics and processing conditions.; RESULTS: Regardless of whether a person was actively or passively viewing the infographics, the most robust predictor of recall was an action-oriented title (p = .003). Surprisingly, infographics in color (vs black-and-white), humorous, or simply worded were no more memorable or effective than if they simply had actionable titles.; CONCLUSIONS: Action-oriented titles make infographics memorable and compelling. Regardless of how involved a person is in processing an infographic, cartoon, or illustration, time spent on perfecting an action-oriented title will be time better spent than on making the infographic colorful, humorous, or detailed. Whereas content and detail of the infographic are important, effectiveness might be improved by the command given in its title or subtitle.

AB The serine/threonine kinase MAP4K4 is a member of the Ste20p (sterile 20 protein) family. MAP4K4 was initially discovered in 1995 as a key kinase in the mating pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was later found to be involved in many aspects of cell functions and many biological and pathological processes. The role of MAP4K4 in immunity, inflammation, metabolic and cardiovascular disease has been recognized. Information regarding MAP4K4 in cancers is extremely limited, but increasing evidence suggests that MAP4K4 also plays an important role in cancer and MAP4K4 may represent a novel actionable cancer therapeutic target. This review summarizes our current understanding of MAP4K4 regulation and MAP4K4 in cancer. MAP4K4-specific inhibitors have been recently developed. We hope that this review article would advocate more basic and preclinical research on MAP4K4 in cancer, which could ultimately provide biological and mechanistic justifications for preclinical and clinical test of MAP4K4 inhibitor in cancer patients.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Biliary tract cancers are relatively uncommon, have an aggressive disease course and a dismal clinical outcome. Until recently, there have been very few clinical advances in the management of these patients and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy has been the only widely accepted systemic therapy. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies can potentially change the treatment paradigm of this disease. Targeted therapy directed against actionable mutations and identification of molecular subsets with distinct prognostic significance is now feasible in clinical practice. Mutation profiling has highlighted the genomic differences between the intra, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. The mutational spectrum of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma differs according to geographic location and ethnicity. There is a higher incidence of chromatin modulating gene mutations in Western patients as compared with Asian patients with liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma. KRAS and p53 mutations are associated with an aggressive disease prognosis while FGFR mutations may signify a relatively indolent disease course of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. FGFR and IDH mutations have promising agents in clinical trials at this time. An estimated 15% of gallbladder cancers have Her2/neu amplification and can be targeted by trastuzumab. On the other hand, an estimated 10-15% of cholangiocarcinomas have DNA repair mutations and maybe candidates for immune therapies with checkpoint inhibitors. The promise of targeted therapies for biliary tract cancers can be fulfilled with well-designed, prospective, and multi-center clinical trials.

AB There is little evidence to direct health systems toward providing efficient interventions to address medical errors, defined as an unintended act of omission or commission or one not executed as intended that may or may not cause harm to the patient but does not achieve its intended outcome. We believe that lack of guidance on what is the most efficient way to reduce medical errors and improve the quality of health-care limits the scale-up of health system improvement interventions. Challenges to economic evaluation of these interventions include defining and implementing improvement interventions in different settings with high fidelity, capturing all of the positive and negative effects of the intervention, using process measures of effectiveness rather than health outcomes, and determining the full cost of the intervention and all economic consequences of its effects. However, health system improvement interventions should be treated similarly to individual medical interventions and undergo rigorous economic evaluation to provide actionable evidence to guide policy-makers in decisions of resource allocation for improvement activities among other competing demands for health-care resources.

AB PURPOSE: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a group of overlapping hereditary disorders of connective tissue with significant morbidity and mortality, including major vascular complications. We sought to identify the diagnostic utility of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel in a mixed EDS cohort.; METHODS: We developed and applied PCR-based NGS assays for targeted, unbiased sequencing of 12 collagen and aortopathy genes to a cohort of 177 unrelated EDS patients. Variants were scored blind to previous genetic testing and then compared with results of previous Sanger sequencing.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight pathogenic variants in COL5A1/2, COL3A1, FBN1, and COL1A1 and four likely pathogenic variants in COL1A1, TGFBR1/2, and SMAD3 were identified by the NGS assays. These included all previously detected single-nucleotide and other short pathogenic variants in these genes, and seven newly detected pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants leading to clinically significant diagnostic revisions. Twenty-two variants of uncertain significance were identified, seven of which were in aortopathy genes and required clinical follow-up.; CONCLUSION: Unbiased NGS-based sequencing made new molecular diagnoses outside the expected EDS genotype-phenotype relationship and identified previously undetected clinically actionable variants in aortopathy susceptibility genes. These data may be of value in guiding future clinical pathways for genetic diagnosis in EDS.Genet Med 18 11, 1119-1127.

AB BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of molecular profiling of tumor tissue to guide treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors is unknown. Our objectives were to evaluate the frequency of genomic alterations, clinical "actionability" of somatic variants, enrollment in mutation-targeted or other clinical trials, and outcome of molecular profiling for advanced solid tumor patients at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM).; METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors aged ≥18years, good performance status, and archival tumor tissue available were prospectively consented. DNA from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was tested using a MALDI-TOF MS hotspot panel or a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Somatic variants were classified according to clinical actionability and an annotated report included in the electronic medical record. Oncologists were provided with summary tables of their patients' molecular profiling results and available mutation-specific clinical trials. Enrolment in genotype-matched versus genotype-unmatched clinical trials following release of profiling results and response by RECIST v1.1 criteria were evaluated.; RESULTS: From March 2012 to July 2014, 1893 patients were enrolled and 1640 tested. After a median follow-up of 18months, 245 patients (15%) who were tested were subsequently treated on 277 therapeutic clinical trials, including 84 patients (5%) on 89 genotype-matched trials. The overall response rate was higher in patients treated on genotype-matched trials (19%) compared with genotype-unmatched trials (9%; p<0.026). In a multi-variable model, trial matching by genotype (p=0.021) and female gender (p=0.034) were the only factors associated with increased likelihood of treatment response.; CONCLUSIONS: Few advanced solid tumor patients enrolled in a prospective institutional molecular profiling trial were treated subsequently on genotype-matched therapeutic trials. In this non-randomized comparison, genotype-enrichment of early phase clinical trials was associated with an increased objective tumor response rate.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01505400 (date of registration 4 January 2012).

AB The rise of genomically targeted therapies and immunotherapy has revolutionized the practice of oncology in the last 10-15 years. At the same time, new technologies and the electronic health record (EHR) in particular have permeated the oncology clinic. Initially designed as billing and clinical documentation systems, EHR systems have not anticipated the complexity and variety of genomic information that needs to be reviewed, interpreted, and acted upon on a daily basis. Improved integration of cancer genomic data with EHR systems will help guide clinician decision making, support secondary uses, and ultimately improve patient care within oncology clinics. Some of the key factors relating to the challenge of integrating cancer genomic data into EHRs include: the bioinformatics pipelines that translate raw genomic data into meaningful, actionable results; the role of human curation in the interpretation of variant calls; and the need for consistent standards with regard to genomic and clinical data. Several emerging paradigms for integration are discussed in this review, including: non-standardized efforts between individual institutions and genomic testing laboratories; "middleware" products that portray genomic information, albeit outside of the clinical workflow; and application programming interfaces that have the potential to work within clinical workflow. The critical need for clinical-genomic knowledge bases, which can be independent or integrated into the aforementioned solutions, is also discussed.

AB Hereditary endometrial carcinoma is associated with germline mutations in Lynch syndrome genes. The role of other cancer predisposition genes is unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence of cancer predisposition gene mutations in an unselected endometrial carcinoma patient cohort. Mutations in 25 genes were identified using a next-generation sequencing-based panel applied in 381 endometrial carcinoma patients who had undergone tumor testing to screen for Lynch syndrome. Thirty-five patients (9.2%) had a deleterious mutation: 22 (5.8%) in Lynch syndrome genes (three MLH1, five MSH2, two EPCAM-MSH2, six MSH6, and six PMS2) and 13 (3.4%) in 10 non-Lynch syndrome genes (four CHEK2, one each in APC, ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, NBN, PTEN, and RAD51C). Of 21 patients with deleterious mutations in Lynch syndrome genes with tumor testing, 2 (9.5%) had tumor testing results suggestive of sporadic cancer. Of 12 patients with deleterious mutations in MSH6 and PMS2, 10 were diagnosed at age >50 and 8 did not have a family history of Lynch syndrome-associated cancers. Patients with deleterious mutations in non-Lynch syndrome genes were more likely to have serous tumor histology (23.1 vs 6.4%, P=0.02). The three patients with non-Lynch syndrome deleterious mutations and serous histology had mutations in BRCA2, BRIP1, and RAD51C. Current clinical criteria fail to identify a portion of actionable mutations in Lynch syndrome and other hereditary cancer syndromes. Performance characteristics of tumor testing are sufficiently robust to implement universal tumor testing to identify patients with Lynch syndrome. Germline multi-gene panel testing is feasible and informative, leading to the identification of additional actionable mutations.

AB Systems change is necessary for improving health care in the United States, especially for populations suffering from health disparities. Theoretical and methodological contributions of anthropology to health care design and delivery can inform systems change by providing a window into provider and patient perceptions and practices. Our community-engaged research teams conduct in-depth investigations of provider perceptions of patients, often uncovering gaps between patient and provider perceptions resulting in the degradation of health equity. We present examples of projects where collaborations between anthropologists and health professionals resulted in actionable data on functioning and malfunctioning systemic momentum toward efforts to eliminate disparities and support wellness.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have high mortality rates in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although the benefit of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies in the ICU has previously been explored, few data exist regarding the use of targeted therapy for NSCLC in such settings. The primary objective of the present study was to report our experience with the use of targeted therapy in patients with NSCLC in the ICU.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single-institution, retrospective medical record review. The eligibility criteria included patients with NSCLC with targetable mutations who had received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the ICU. Cases were identified by queries of our institution's information warehouse database and pharmacy dispensary records from 2010 to2015.; RESULTS: All 9 patients who had received TKIs in the ICU had acute respiratory failure. Three patients were successfully extubated after initiating TKI therapy, although 1 required later tracheostomy. TKI therapy stabilized another patient's refractory disseminated intravascular coagulation. The remaining 5 patients showed no measurable clinical improvement and were transitioned to comfort care. The overall ICU mortality rate was 56%.; CONCLUSION: Patients with metastatic NSCLC requiring mechanical ventilation have high mortality rates. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally contraindicated for poor performance status patients. However, targeted TKI therapy should be considered, given its proven efficacy and few systemic side effects. We recommend the empiric use of targeted therapy for NSCLC patients with suspected and/or known actionable mutations presenting with multifactorial respiratory failure to the ICU, with aggressive determination of the mutation status if not known.

AB Modern scientific inquiries require significant data-driven evidence and trans-disciplinary expertise to extract valuable information and gain actionable knowledge about natural processes. Effective evidence-based decisions require collection, processing and interpretation of vast amounts of complex data. The Moore's and Kryder's laws of exponential increase of computational power and information storage, respectively, dictate the need rapid trans-disciplinary advances, technological innovation and effective mechanisms for managing and interrogating Big Healthcare Data. In this article, we review important aspects of Big Data analytics and discuss important questions like: What are the challenges and opportunities associated with this biomedical, social, and healthcare data avalanche? Are there innovative statistical computing strategies to represent, model, analyze and interpret Big heterogeneous data? We present the foundation of a new compressive big data analytics (CBDA) framework for representation, modeling and inference of large, complex and heterogeneous datasets. Finally, we consider specific directions likely to impact the process of extracting information from Big healthcare data, translating that information to knowledge, and deriving appropriate actions.

AB Immunotherapy approaches for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have met with limited success. It has been postulated that a low mutation load may lead to a paucity of T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it is also possible that while neoantigens are present, an effective immune response cannot be generated due to an immune suppressive TME. To discern whether targetable neoantigens exist in PDAC, we performed a comprehensive study using genomic profiles of 221 PDAC cases extracted from public databases. Our findings reveal that: (a) nearly all PDAC samples harbor potentially targetable neoantigens; (b) T cells are present but generally show a reduced activation signature; and (c) markers of efficient antigen presentation are associated with a reduced signature of markers characterizing cytotoxic T cells. These findings suggest that despite the presence of tumor specific neoepitopes, T cell activation is actively suppressed in PDAC. Further, we identify iNOS as a potential mediator of immune suppression that might be actionable using pharmacological avenues.

AB Use of next-generation sequencing to detect somatic variants in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues poses a challenge for clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories because of variable DNA quality and quantity, and the potential to detect low allele frequency somatic variants difficult to verify by non-next-generation sequencing methods. We evaluated somatic variant detection performance of the MiSeq and Ion Proton benchtop sequencers using two commercially available panels, the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel and the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel Version 2. Both the MiSeq-TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel and Ion Proton-AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel Version 2 were comparable in terms of detection of somatic variants and allele frequency determination using DNA extracted from tumor tissue. Concordance was 100% between the panels for detection of somatic variants in genomic regions tested by both panels, including 27 variants present at low somatic allele frequency (<15%). Use of both the MiSeq and Ion Proton platforms in a combined workflow enabled detection of potentially actionable variants with importance for patient diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment in 49% (305/621) of cases. Overall, a combined workflow using both platforms enabled successful molecular profiling of 96% (621/644) of tumor samples, and provided an approach for verification of somatic variants not amenable to verification by Sanger sequencing (<15% variant allele frequency).

AB Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a robust technology for comprehensive assessment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it may not provide sufficiently rapid and sensitive detection of the EGFR T790M mutation, the most clinically relevant resistance biomarker. Here, we describe a digital PCR (dPCR) assay for rapid T790M detection on aliquots of NGS libraries prepared for comprehensive profiling, fully maximizing broad genomic analysis on limited samples. Tumor DNAs from patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas and acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were prepared for Memorial Sloan-Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets sequencing, a hybrid capture-based assay interrogating 410 cancer-related genes. Precapture library aliquots were used for rapid EGFR T790M testing by dPCR, and results were compared with NGS and locked nucleic acid-PCR Sanger sequencing (reference high sensitivity method). Seventy resistance samples showed 99% concordance with the reference high sensitivity method in accuracy studies. Input as low as 2.5 ng provided a sensitivity of 1% and improved further with increasing DNA input. dPCR on libraries required less DNA and showed better performance than direct genomic DNA. dPCR on NGS libraries is a robust and rapid approach to EGFR T790M testing, allowing most economical utilization of limited material for comprehensive assessment. The same assay can also be performed directly on any limited DNA source and cell-free DNA. Copyright © 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

AB BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasound often includes cardiac ultrasound. It is commonly used to evaluate cardiac function in critically ill patients but lacks the specific quantitative anatomic assessment afforded by standard transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). We developed the Focused Rapid Echocardiographic Examination (FREE), a hybrid between a cardiac ultrasound and TTE that places an emphasis on cardiac function rather than anatomy. We hypothesized that data obtained from FREE correlate well with TTE while providing actionable information for clinical decision making.; METHODS: FREE examinations evaluating cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction), diastolic dysfunction (including early mitral Doppler flow [E] and early mitral tissue Doppler [E']), right ventricular function, cardiac output, preload (left ventricular internal dimension end diastole), stroke volume, stroke volume variation, inferior vena cava diameter, and inferior vena cava collapse were performed. Patients who underwent both a TTE and FREE on the same day were identified as the cohort, and quantitative measurements were compared. Correlation analyses were performed to assess levels of agreement.; RESULTS: A total of 462 FREE examinations were performed, in which 69 patients had both a FREE and TTE. FREE ejection fraction was strongly correlated with TTE (r = 0.89, 95% confidence interval). Left ventricular outflow tract, left ventricular internal dimension end diastole, E, and lateral E' derived from FREE were also strongly correlated with TTE measurements (r = 0.83, r = 0.94, r = 0.77, and r = 0.88, respectively). In 82% of the patients, right ventricular function for FREE was the same as that reported for TTE; pericardial effusion was detected on both examinations in 94% of the cases. No significant valvular anatomy was missed with the FREE examination.; CONCLUSION: Functionally rather than anatomically based hybrid ultrasound examinations, like the FREE, facilitate decision making for critically ill patients. The FREE's functional assessment correlates well with TTE measurements and may be of significant clinical value in critically ill patients, especially when used in remote operating environments where resources are limited.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic test, level III.

AB OBJECTIVES: Socioeconomic differences in screening have been well documented in upper-income countries; however, few studies have examined socioeconomic status (SES) over the life-course in relation to cancer screening in lower-income and middle-income countries. Here, we examine individual, parental and life-course SES differences in breast and cervical cancer screening among women in India, China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa.; SETTING: Data from the WHO's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) 2007-2008 data were used for survey-weighted multivariable regression analysis. We examined the association between individual, parental and life-course SES in relation to breast and cervical cancer screening using education-based and employment-based measures of SES.; PARTICIPANTS: 22 283 women aged 18-65 years, recruited from China, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa.; RESULTS: Having a college degree (OR 4.18; 95% CI 2.36 to 7.40) increased the odds of breast cancer screening compared with no formal education. Women with higher parental SES were almost 10 times more likely to receive breast cancer screening (OR 9.84; 95% CI 1.75 to 55.5) compared with women with low parental SES. Stable higher life-course (OR 3.07; 95% CI 1.96 to 4.79) increased breast cancer screening by threefold and increased cervical cancer screening by more than fourfold (OR 4.35; 95% CI 2.94 to 6.45); however, declining life-course SES was associated with reduced breast cancer screening (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.79) compared to low life-course SES.; CONCLUSIONS: Higher individual, parental and life-course SES was positively associated with breast and cervical cancer screening, although education-based SES measures were stronger predictors of screening compared with employment-based measures. Improving knowledge of the benefits of cancer screening and integrating cancer screening into routine healthcare practice for low SES women are actionable strategies that may significantly improve screening rates in low-income and middle-income countries.

AB Genomic research of high grade glioma (HGG) has revealed complex biology with potential for therapeutic impact. However, the utilization of this information and impact upon patient outcome has yet to be assessed. We performed capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) genomic analysis assay of 236/315 cancer-associated genes, with average depth of over 1000 fold, to guide treatment in HGG patients. We reviewed clinical utility and response rates in correlation to NGS results. Forty-three patients were profiled: 34 glioblastomas, 8 anaplastic astrocytomas, and one patient with anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Twenty-five patients were profiled with the 315 gene panel. The median number of identified genomic alterations (GAs) per patient was 4.5 (range 1-23). In 41 patients (95%) at least one therapeutically-actionable GA was detected, most commonly in EGFR [17 (40%)]. Genotype-directed treatments were prescribed in 13 patients, representing a 30% treatment decision impact. Treatment with targeted agents included everolimus as a single agent and in combination with erlotinib; erlotinib; afatinib; palbociclib; trametinib and BGJ398. Treatments targeted various genomic findings including EGFR alterations, mTOR activation, cell cycle targets and FGFR1 mutations. None of the patients showed response to respective biologic treatments. In this group of patients with HGG, NGS revealed a high frequency of GAs that lead to targeted treatment in 30% of the patients. The lack of response suggests that further study of mechanisms of resistance in HGG is warranted before routine use of biologically-targeted agents based on NGS results.

AB Histopathology is crucial to diagnosis of cancer, yet its interpretation is tedious and challenging. To facilitate this procedure, content-based image retrieval methods have been developed as case-based reasoning tools. Especially, with the rapid growth of digital histopathology, hashing-based retrieval approaches are gaining popularity due to their exceptional efficiency and scalability. Nevertheless, few hashing-based histopathological image analysis methods perform feature fusion, despite the fact that it is a common practice to improve image retrieval performance. In response, we exploit joint kernel-based supervised hashing (JKSH) to integrate complementary features in a hashing framework. Specifically, hashing functions are designed based on linearly combined kernel functions associated with individual features. Supervised information is incorporated to bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level diagnosis. An alternating optimization method is utilized to learn the kernel combination and hashing functions. The obtained hashing functions compress multiple high-dimensional features into tens of binary bits, enabling fast retrieval from a large database. Our approach is extensively validated on 3121 breast-tissue histopathological images by distinguishing between actionable and benign cases. It achieves 88.1% retrieval precision and 91.3% classification accuracy within 16.5ms query time, comparing favorably with traditional methods. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the genomic landscape of malignant mesothelioma may identify novel molecular drivers of this ultra-rare disease, which can lead to an expanded roster of targeted therapies and clinical trial options for patients with mesothelioma. We examined the molecular profiles of 42 patients with malignant mesothelioma (including pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial) that were referred by clinicians to be tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory using next-generation sequencing (NGS; 182 or 236 genes). Among 42 patients, there were 116 alterations, with 92 being distinct. The number of genomic alterations per patient ranged from 1 to 5 (median = 3). No two patients had identical molecular portfolios. The most common aberrations were in BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1; 47.6% [20/42]), NF2 (38.1% [16/42]), and CDKN2A/B (loss) (35.7% [15/42]). BAP1 alterations and CDKN2A/B loss were associated with pleural mesothelioma (OR 3.4, P = 0.059 [BAP1] [trend]; OR 5.8, P = 0.01 [CDKN2A/B]). All 42 patients had a molecular abnormality that was potentially actionable (median = three actionable alterations per patient; range, 1 to 5), and, in 40 patients (95.2%), a drug approved by the FDA was applicable. In conclusion, each individual with malignant mesothelioma harbored a unique set of genomic aberrations, suggesting that NGS-based profiling of patients will be needed if patients are to be optimally matched to cognate treatments. All 42 patients had at least one alteration that was, in theory, pharmacologically tractable. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(10); 2498-507. ©2016 AACR. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Universal access to safe drinking water is prioritized in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Collecting reliable and actionable water quality information in low-resource settings, however, is challenging, and little is known about the correspondence between water quality data collected by local monitoring agencies and global frameworks for water safety. Using 42 926 microbial water quality test results from 32 surveillance agencies and water suppliers in seven sub-Saharan African countries, we determined the degree to which water sources were monitored, how water quality varied by source type, and institutional responses to results. Sixty-four percent of the water samples were collected from piped supplies, although the majority of Africans rely on nonpiped sources. Piped supplies had the lowest levels of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) compared to any other source type: only 4% of samples of water piped to plots and 2% of samples from water piped to public taps/standpipes were positive for FIB (n = 14 948 and n = 12 278, respectively). Among other types of improved sources, samples from harvested rainwater and boreholes were less often positive for FIB (22%, n = 167 and 31%, n = 3329, respectively) than protected springs or protected dug wells (39%, n = 472 and 65%, n = 505). When data from different settings were aggregated, the FIB levels in different source types broadly reflected the source-type water safety framework used by the Joint Monitoring Programme. However, the insufficient testing of nonpiped sources relative to their use indicates important gaps in current assessments. Our results emphasize the importance of local data collection for water safety management and measurement of progress toward universal safe drinking water access.

AB BACKGROUND: Castration resistance creates a significant problem in the treatment of prostate cancer. Constitutively active splice variants of androgen receptor (AR) have emerged as drivers for resistance to androgen deprivation therapy, including the next-generation androgen-AR axis inhibitors abiraterone and enzalutamide. In this study, we describe the characteristics of a novel castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) model, designated JDCaP-hr (hormone refractory).; METHODS: JDCaP-hr was established from an androgen-dependent JDCaP xenograft model after surgical castration. The expression of AR and its splice variants in JDCaP-hr was evaluated by immunoblotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effects of AR antagonists and testosterone on JDCaP-hr were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The roles of full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V7 in JDCaP-hr cell growth were evaluated using RNA interference.; RESULTS: JDCaP-hr acquired a C-terminally truncated AR protein during progression from the parental JDCaP. The expression of AR-FL and AR-V7 mRNA was upregulated by 10-fold in JDCaP-hr compared with that in JDCaP, indicating that the JDCaP and JDCaP-hr models simulate castration resistance with some clinical features, such as overexpression of AR and its splice variants. The AR antagonist bicalutamide did not affect JDCaP-hr xenograft growth, and importantly, testosterone induced tumor regression. In vitro analysis demonstrated that androgen-independent prostate-specific antigen secretion and cell proliferation of JDCaP-hr were predominantly mediated by AR-V7. JDCaP-hr cell growth displayed a bell-shaped dependence on testosterone, and it was suppressed by physiological concentrations of testosterone. Testosterone induced rapid downregulation of both AR-FL and AR-V7 expression at physiological concentrations and suppressed expression of the AR target gene KLK3.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the clinical value of testosterone therapy, including bipolar androgen therapy, in the treatment of AR-overexpressed CRPC driven by AR splice variants that are not clinically actionable at present.

AB To determine the association of somatic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with risk of relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), we retrospectively studied pre-transplantation genetic profiles obtained from next-generation sequencing of 26 genes in 112 adult patients with AML who underwent alloHSCT. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the association between the presence of a pathogenic mutation and risk of relapse after alloHSCT. Eighty-six percent (96 of 112) of patients had at least 1 pathogenic mutation. Mutations in TP53, WT1, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) were associated with an increased risk of relapse after alloHSCT (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.90; P=.009; aHR, 2.51; P=.02; and aHR, 1.83; P=.07, respectively). DNMT3A mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations was associated with a lower relapse risk (aHR, .22; P=.04). Comparison of pre-alloHSCT and post-alloHSCT genetic profiles showed clonal evolution in 6 of 6 patients, including acquisition of actionable mutations in 4 patients. In summary, genetic profiling is useful for assessing relapse risk in patients with AML undergoing alloHSCT and may identify patients in need of strategies to reduce this risk. Clonal evolution is present at post-alloHSCT relapse and repeat genetic profiling may uncover acquired actionable mutations.

However, there are few cross-cutting recommendations and limited guidance available in this rapidly developing research area. Our goal is to report key findings from a 2013 Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute workshop on this topic and a summary of actions that followed from the workshop, and present resulting recommendations that address patient, clinical and research/quality improvement barriers to regular use. These findings provide actionable guidance across research and practice settings to promote and sustain widespread adoption of patient-reported outcomes across patient populations, healthcare settings and electronic health record systems.

AB Precision oncology is predicated upon the ability to detect specific actionable genomic alterations and to monitor their adaptive evolution during treatment to counter resistance. Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

AB BACKGROUND: Quality indicators are increasingly used to measure the quality of care and compare quality across hospitals. In the Netherlands over the past few years numerous hospital quality indicators have been developed and reported. Dutch indicators are mainly based on expert consensus and face validity and little is known about their construct validity. Therefore, we aim to study the construct validity of a set of national hospital quality indicators for hip replacements.; METHODS: We used the scores of 100 Dutch hospitals on national hospital quality indicators looking at care delivered over a two year period. We assessed construct validity by relating structure, process and outcome indicators using chi-square statistics, bootstrapped Spearman correlations, and independent sample t-tests. We studied indicators that are expected to associate as they measure the same clinical construct.; RESULT: Among the 28 hypothesized correlations, three associations were significant in the direction hypothesized. Hospitals with low scores on wound infections had high scores on scheduling postoperative appointments (p-value=0.001) and high scores on not transfusing homologous blood (correlation coefficient=-0.28; p-value=0.05). Hospitals with high scores on scheduling complication meetings, also had high scores on providing thrombosis prophylaxis (correlation coefficient=0.21; p-value=0.04).; CONCLUSION: Despite the face validity of hospital quality indicators for hip replacement, construct validity seems to be limited. Although the individual indicators might be valid and actionable, drawing overall conclusions based on the whole indicator set should be done carefully, as construct validity could not be established. The factors that may explain the lack of construct validity are poor data quality, no adjustment for case-mix and statistical uncertainty.

AB In vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays are highly complex molecular assays that can provide clinically actionable information regarding the underlying tumour biology and facilitate personalised treatment. These assays are only useful in clinical practice if all of the following are established: analytical validation (i.e., how accurately/reliably the assay measures the molecular characteristics), clinical validation (i.e., how consistently/accurately the test detects/predicts the outcomes of interest), and clinical utility (i.e., how likely the test is to significantly improve patient outcomes). In considering the use of these assays, clinicians often focus primarily on the clinical validity/utility; however, the analytical validity of an assay (e.g., its accuracy, reproducibility, and standardisation) should also be evaluated and carefully considered. This review focuses on the rigorous analytical validation and performance of the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, which is performed at the Central Clinical Reference Laboratory of Genomic Health, Inc. The assay process includes tumour tissue enrichment (if needed), RNA extraction, gene expression quantitation (using a gene panel consisting of 16 cancer genes plus 5 reference genes and quantitative real-time RT-PCR), and an automated computer algorithm to produce a Recurrence Score result (scale: 0-100). This review presents evidence showing that the Recurrence Score result reported for each patient falls within a tight clinically relevant confidence interval. Specifically, the review discusses how the development of the assay was designed to optimise assay performance, presents data supporting its analytical validity, and describes the quality control and assurance programmes that ensure optimal test performance over time.

AB There remains considerable controversy about how the brain operates. This review focuses on brain activity rather than just structure and on concepts of action and actionability rather than truth conditions. Neural Communication is reviewed as a crucial aspect of neural encoding. Consequently, logical inference is superseded by neural simulation. Some remaining mysteries are discussed.

AB Identification of the tissue of origin in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) poses a diagnostic challenge and is critical for directing site-specific therapy. Currently, clinical decision-making in patients with CUP primarily relies on histopathology and clinical features. Comprehensive molecular profiling has the potential to contribute to diagnostic categorization and, most importantly, guide CUP therapy through identification of actionable lesions. We here report the case of an advanced-stage malignancy initially mimicking poorly differentiated soft-tissue sarcoma that did not respond to multiagent chemotherapy. Molecular profiling within a clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing program revealed a heterozygous, highly amplified KRAS G12S mutation, compound-heterozygous TP53 mutation/deletion, high mutational load, and focal high-level amplification of Chromosomes 9p (including PDL1 [CD274] and JAK2) and 10p (including GATA3). Integrated analysis of molecular data and histopathology provided a rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy with pembrolizumab, which resulted in rapid clinical improvement and a lasting partial remission. Histopathological analyses ruled out sarcoma and established the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Although neither histopathology nor molecular data were able to pinpoint the tissue of origin, our analyses established several differential diagnoses including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We analyzed 157 TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, revealing PDL1 copy number gains coinciding with excessive PDL1 mRNA expression in 24% of cases. Collectively, these results illustrate the impact of multidimensional tumor profiling in cases with nondescript histology and immunophenotype, show the predictive potential of PDL1 amplification for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and suggest a targeted therapeutic strategy in Chromosome 9p24.1/PDL1-amplified cancers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Primary care services form the foundation of modern healthcare systems, yet the breadth and complexity of services and diversity of patient populations may present challenges for creating comprehensive primary care information systems. Our objective is to develop regional-level information on the performance of primary care in Canada.; METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to identify existing initiatives in primary care performance measurement and reporting across 11 countries. The results of this review were used by our international team of primary care researchers and clinicians to propose an approach for regional-level primary care reporting.; RESULTS: We found a gap between conceptual primary care performance measurement frameworks in the peer-reviewed literature and real-world primary care performance measurement and reporting activities. We did not find a conceptual framework or analytic approach that could readily form the foundation of a regional-level primary care information system. Therefore, we propose an approach to reporting comprehensive and actionable performance information according to widely accepted core domains of primary care as well as different patient population groups.; CONCLUSIONS: An approach that bridges the gap between conceptual frameworks and real-world performance measurement and reporting initiatives could address some of the potential pitfalls of existing ways of presenting performance information (i.e., by single diseases or by age). This approach could produce meaningful and actionable information on the quality of primary care services. Copyright © 2016 Longwoods Publishing.

AB INTRODUCTION: We performed a genomic study in lung adenocarcinoma cases with discordant anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.; METHODS: DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissuesof 16 discordant (four FISH-positive/IHC-negative and 12 FISH-negative/IHC-positive) cases by Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH and ALK IHC testing (ALK1 clone) were subjected to whole gene capture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of nine genes, including ALK, echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 gene (EML4), kinesin family member 5B gene (KIF5B), staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 gene (SND1), BRAF,ret proto-oncogene (RET), ezrin gene (EZR), ROS1, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). All discordant cases (except one FISH-negative/IHC-positive case without sufficient tissue) were analyzed by IHC with D5F3 antibody. In one case with fresh frozen tissue, whole transcriptome sequencing was also performed. Twenty-six concordant (16FISH-positive/IHC-positive and 10 FISH-negative/IHC-negative) cases were included as controls.; RESULTS: In four ALK FISH-positive/IHC-negative cases, no EML4-ALK fusion gene was observed by NGS, but in one case using fresh frozen tissue, we identified EML4-baculoviral AIPrepeat containing 6 gene (BIRC6) and AP2 associated kinase 1gene (AAK1)-ALK fusion genes. Whole transcriptome sequencing revealed a highly expressed EML4-BIRC6 fusiontranscript and a minimally expressed AAK1 transcript. Among the 12 FISH-negative/IHC-positivecases, no evidence of ALK gene rearrangement was detected by NGS. Eleven of12 FISH-negative/IHC-positive cases detected by ALK1 clone were concordant by repeat ALK IHC with D5F3 antibody (i.e., FISH-negative/IHC-negative by D5F3 clone). Among the 16 ALK FISH-positive/IHC-positive positive controls,whole gene capture identified ALK gene fusion in 15 cases, including in one case with Huntington interacting protein 1 gene (HIP1)-ALK. No ALK fusion gene was observed in any of the 10 FISH-negative/IHC-negative cases. Other fusion genes involving ROS1, EZR, BRAF, and SND1 were alsofound.; CONCLUSIONS: ALK FISH results appeared to be false-positivein three of four FISH-positive/IHC-negative cases, whereas no false-negative ALK FISH case was identified among 12 ALK FISH-negative/IHC-positive cases by ALK1clone, which was in keeping with the concordant FISH-negative/IHC-negative status by D5F3 clone. Our targeted wholegene capture approach using formalin-fixedparaffin embedded samples was effective for detecting rearrangements involving ALK and other actionable oncogenes.

AB PURPOSE: Screening multiple genes for inherited cancer predisposition expands opportunities for cancer prevention; however, reports of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) may limit clinical usefulness. We used an expert-driven approach, exploiting all available information, to evaluate multigene panels for inherited cancer predisposition in a clinical series that included multiple cancer types and complex family histories.; METHODS: For 1,462 sequential patients referred for testing by BROCA or ColoSeq multigene panels, genomic DNA was sequenced and variants were interpreted by multiple experts using International Agency for Research on Cancer guidelines and incorporating evolutionary conservation, known and predicted variant consequences, and personal and family cancer history. Diagnostic yield was evaluated for various presenting conditions and family-history profiles.; RESULTS: Of 1,462 patients, 12% carried damaging mutations in established cancer genes. Diagnostic yield varied by clinical presentation. Actionable results were identified for 13% of breast and colorectal cancer patients and for 4% of cancer-free subjects, based on their family histories of cancer. Incidental findings explaining cancer in neither the patient nor the family were present in 1.7% of subjects. Less than 1% of patients carried VUS in BRCA1 or BRCA2. For all genes combined, initial reports contained VUS for 10.5% of patients, which declined to 7.5% of patients after reclassification based on additional information.; CONCLUSIONS: Individualized interpretation of gene panels is a complex medical activity. Interpretation by multiple experts in the context of personal and family histories maximizes actionable results and minimizes reports of VUS.Genet Med 18 10, 974-981.

AB The infant mortality rate (IMR) of 6.0 per 1000 live births in the United States in 2013 is nearly the highest among developed countries. Moreover, the IMR among blacks is >twice that among whites-11.11 versus 5.06 deaths per 1000 live births.This higher IMR and racial disparity in IMR is due to a higher preterm birth rate (11.4% of live births in 2013) and higher IMR among term infants. The United States also ranks near the bottom for maternal mortality and life expectancy among the developed nations-despite ranking highest in the proportion of gross national product spent on health care. This suggests that factors other than health care contribute to the higher IMR and racial disparity in IMR. One factor is disadvantaged socioeconomic status. All of the actionable determinates that negatively impact health-personal behavior, social factors, heath-care access and quality and the environment-disproportionately affect the poor. Addressing disadvantaged socioeconomic status by improving access to quality health care and increasing social expenditures would have the greatest impact on the USA's IMR and racial disparity in IMR.

AB Patients, clinicians, and policymakers alike need access to high-quality scientific evidence in order to make informed choices about health and healthcare, but the current national clinical trials enterprise is not yet optimally configured for the efficient creation and dissemination of such evidence. However, new technologies and methods hold significant potential for accelerating the rate at which we are able to translate raw findings gathered from both patient care and clinical research into actionable knowledge. We are now entering a period in which the quantitative sciences are emerging as the critical disciplines for advancing knowledge about health and healthcare, and statisticians will increasingly serve as critical mediators in transforming data into evidence. In this new, data-centric era, biostatisticians not only need to be expert at analyzing data but should also be involved directly in diverse efforts, including the review and analysis of research portfolios in order to optimize the relevance of research questions, the use of "quality by design" principles to improve reliability and validity of each individual trial, and the mining of aggregate knowledge derived from the clinical research enterprise as a whole. In order to meet these challenges, it is imperative that we (1) nurture and build the biostatistical workforce, (2) develop a deeper understanding of the biological and clinical context among statisticians, (3) facilitate collaboration among biostatisticians and other members of the clinical trials enterprise, (4) focus on communication skills in training and education programs, and (5) enhance the quantitative capacity of the research and clinical practice worlds. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB In the United States, federal regulations require that outpatient practices provide a clinical summary to ensure that patients understand what transpired during their appointment and what to do before the next visit. To determine whether clinical summaries are appropriately designed to achieve these objectives, we examined their content and formatting and their usability. We obtained a convenience sample of clinical summaries from 13 diverse practices across the U.S. and assessed their characteristics using validated measures. We also interviewed key informants at these practices to assess their views of the documents. The summaries were generated by seven different electronic health record platforms. They had small font sizes (median, 10 point) and high reading grade levels (median, 10). Suitability, measured with the Suitability Assessment of Materials was low (median score, 61%) and understandability and actionability, measured with the Patient Education Materials Assessment Test, were fair to moderate (65% and 78%, respectively). Content and order of content were inconsistent across the summaries. Among physicians, 46% found the summaries helpful for clarifying medications while 38% found them helpful for conveying follow-up information. Results suggest that clinical summaries in the U.S. may often be suboptimally designed for communicating important information with patients. A patient-centered approach to designing them is warranted. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers (BCs) constitute the most frequent BC subtype. The molecular landscape of ER+ relapsed disease is not well characterized. In this study, we aimed to describe the genomic evolution between primary (P) and matched metastatic (M) ER+ BCs after failure of adjuvant therapy.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 182 ER+ metastatic BC patients with long-term follow-up were identified from a single institution. P tumor tissue was available for all patients, with 88 having matched M material. According to the availability of tumor material, samples were characterized using a 120 mutational hotspot qPCR, a 29 gene copy number aberrations (CNA) and a 400 gene expression panels. ESR1 mutations were assayed by droplet digital PCR. Molecular alterations were correlated with overall survival (OS) using the Cox proportional hazards regression models.; RESULTS: The median follow-up was 6.4 years (range 0.5-26.6 years). Genomic analysis of P tumors revealed somatic mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, AKT1, FGFR3, HRAS and BRAF at frequencies of 41%, 6%, 5%, 2%, 1% and 2%, respectively, and CN amplification of CCND1, ZNF703, FGFR1, RSF1 and PAK1 at 23%, 19%, 17%, 12% and 11%, respectively. Mutations and CN amplifications were largely concordant between P and matched M (>84%). ESR1 mutations were found in 10.8% of the M but none of the P. Thirteen genes, among which ESR1, FOXA1, and HIF1A, showed significant differential expression between P and M. In P, the differential expression of 18 genes, among which IDO1, was significantly associated with OS (FDR < 0.1).; CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large concordance between P and matched M for the evaluated molecular alterations, potential actionable targets such as ESR1 mutations were found only in M. This supports the importance of characterizing the M disease. Other targets we identified, such as HIF1A and IDO1, warrant further investigation in this patient population. © The Author 2016.

AB Detection of somatic mutations in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), especially adenocarcinomas, is important for directing patient care when targeted therapy is available. Here, we present our experience with genotyping NSCLC using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. We tested 453 NSCLC samples from 407 individual patients using the 50 gene AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 from May 2013 to July 2015. Using 10 ng of DNA, up to 11 samples were simultaneously sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM (316 and 318 chips). We identified variants with the Ion Torrent Variant Caller Plugin, and Golden Helix's SVS software was used for annotation and prediction of the significance of the variants. Three hundred ninety-eight samples were successfully sequenced (12.1% failure rate). In all, 633 variants in 41 genes were detected with a median of 2 (range of 0 to 7) variants per sample. Mutations detected in BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA were considered potentially actionable and were identified in 237 samples, most commonly in KRAS (37.9%), EGFR (11.1%), BRAF (4.8%), and PIK3CA (4.3%). In our patient population, all mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF were mutually exclusive. The Ion Torrent Ampliseq technology can be utilized on small biopsy and cytology specimens, requires very little input DNA, and can be applied in clinical laboratories for genotyping of NSCLC. This targeted next-generation sequencing approach allows for detection of common and also rare mutations that are clinically actionable in multiple patients simultaneously.

AB Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the most common and lethal congenital anomalies, and significant evidence is available in support of a genetic contribution to its etiology, including single-gene knockout mice associated with diaphragmatic defects, rare monogenetic disorders in humans, familial aggregation, and association of CDH with chromosomal abnormalities. Structural lung defects in the form of lung hypoplasia are almost invariably seen in patients with CDH and frequently in animal models of this condition. Better understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary defects in CDH has the potential for creating targeted therapies, particularly in postnatal stages, when therapeutics can have maximum clinical impact on the surviving cohorts. Successful treatment of CDH is dependent on the integration of human genomic and genetic data with developmental expression profiling, mouse knockouts, and gene network and pathway modeling, which have generated a large number of candidate genes and pathways for follow-up studies. In particular, defective alveolarization appears to be a common and potentially actionable phenotype in both patients and animal models. Copyright © 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

AB BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is an important measure of physiologic reserve associated with worse survival and represents an actionable factor for the cancer population. However, the incidence of cachexia in surgical cancer patients and its impact on postoperative outcomes are currently unknown.; METHODS: A prospective cohort study enrolling patients having elective cancer surgery (2012-2014) at a Veterans Affairs tertiary referral center. Preoperative cancer cachexia (weight loss ≥5% over 6-mo period before surgery) was the predictor of interest. The primary outcome was 60-d postoperative complications (VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program). Patients were grouped by body mass index (BMI) category (<25, 25-29.9, ≥30), and interaction between cachexia and BMI was tested for the primary outcome. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between preoperative cachexia and postoperative complications.; RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 16.6% had preoperative cachexia, and 51.8% developed ≥1postoperative complications. Complications were more common in cachectic patients (64.3% versus 49.3%, P=0.07). This association varied by BMI category, andinteraction analysis was significant for those with normal or underweight BMI (BMI < 25, P=0.03). After multivariate modeling, in patients with normal or underweight BMI, preoperative cachexia was associated with higher odds of postoperative complications (odds ratios, 5.08 [95% confidence intervals, 1.18-21.88]; P=0.029). Additional predictors of complications included major surgery (3.19 [1.24-8.21], P=0.01), ostomy (4.43 [1.68-11.72], P=0.003), and poor baseline performance status (2.31 [1.05-5.08], P=0.03).; CONCLUSIONS: Cancer cachexia is common in surgical patients, and is an important predictor of postoperative complications, though its effect varies by BMI. As a modifiable predictor of worse outcomes, future studies should examine the role of cachexia treatment before cancer surgery. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: More than half of severely injured patients are initially transported from the scene of injury to nontrauma centers (NTCs), with many requiring subsequent transfer to trauma center (TC) care. Definitive care in the setting of severe injury is time sensitive. However, transferring severely injured patients from an NTC is a complex process often fraught with delays. Selection of the receiving TC and the mode of interfacility transport both strongly influence total transfer time and are highly amenable to quality improvement initiatives.; METHODS: We analyzed transfer strategies, defined as the pairing of a destination and mode of transport (land vs. rotary wing vs. fixed wing), for severely injured adult patients. Existing transfer strategies at each NTC were derived from trauma registry data. Geographic Information Systems network analysis was used to identify the strategy that minimized transfer times the most as well as alternate strategies (+15 or +30 minutes) for each NTC. Transfer network efficiency was characterized based on optimality and stability.; RESULTS: We identified 7,702 severely injured adult patients transferred from 146 NTCs to 9 TCs. Nontrauma centers transferred severely injured patients to a median of 3 (interquartile range, 1-4) different TCs and utilized a median of 4 (interquartile range, 2-6) different transfer strategies. After allowing for the use of alternate transfer strategies, 73.1% of severely injured patients were transported using optimal/alternate strategies, and only 40.4% of NTCs transferred more than 90% of patients using an optimal/alternate transfer strategy. Three quarters (75.5%) of transfers occurred between NTCs and their most common receiving TC.; CONCLUSION: More than a quarter of patients with severe traumatic injuries undergoing interfacility transport to a TC in Ontario are consistently transported using a nonoptimal combination of destination and mode of transport. Our novel analytic approach can be easily adapted to different system configurations and provides actionable data that can be provided to NTCs and other stakeholders.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level IV.

AB BACKGROUND: Although there are a growing number of initiatives aimed at supporting guideline implementation in resource-constrained settings, few studies assess progress on achieving next steps and goals after the initial activities are completed and the initial funding period has ended. The aim of the current study was to conduct a qualitative process evaluation of progress, barriers, facilitators, and proposed solutions to operationalize nine recommendations to prepare Kosovo to implement the 2012 World Health Organization (WHO) prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage guideline.; METHODS/DESIGN: In 2012, we co-created nine recommendations designed to support implementing the WHO's guideline on the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage in Kosovo. The current study uses a realist evaluation approach to assess activities and progress two years after the recommendations were developed. The study involved conducting qualitative focus groups and one-on-one interviews with participants from the first meeting to evaluate the activities and progress on the nine recommendations.; RESULTS: Forty-three participants provided insights into the barriers and opportunities experienced to date and proposed future directions. Although progress has been made towards implementation of a number of the recommendations, scaling up has been limited by barriers, such as lack of awareness, limited resources, and evaluation challenges. Participants proposed addressing these barriers by building within- and between-country partnerships to facilitate guideline implementation. In addition, participants reported less progress on implementing recommendations related to broader cultural changes, which indicates a need for specific and actionable recommendations to operationalize implementation efforts.; CONCLUSIONS: In the two years since the initial meeting, there has been mixed progress on the recommendations. Based on participant feedback, we refined the recommendations so that they can be operationalized by health care system stakeholders in Kosovo to further support implementation efforts. It is beneficial to share these lessons learned throughout the implementation process to inform next steps in Kosovo and offer ideas for use in other settings.

AB PURPOSE: The 21-gene Recurrence Score assay (Oncotype DX) provides prognostic/predictive information in oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) early breast cancer, but access/reimbursement has been limited in most European countries in the absence of prospective outcome data. Recently, two large prospective studies and a real-life 5-year outcome study have been reported. We performed a pooled analysis of prospective European impact studies to generate robust data on impact of use in different clinical subgroups.; METHODS: The analysis included four studies (French, German, Spanish, and British) in ER+ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer patients (n=527). Node-positive patients were excluded.; RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that treatment recommendations changed in 32% of patients post-testing; chemotherapy recommendation rate decreased from 55% to 34%. Change rates in the individual studies ranged from 30% to 37%. The highest change rates were in patients originally recommended chemotherapy and in grade II tumours; there was no subgroup without a treatment recommendation change. Notably, 31% of patients with an intermediate Recurrence Score result had a treatment recommendation change suggesting that testing provides actionable information in this group. With the exception of the German study (where chemotherapy rates remained high [41%] post-testing), between-study variability in treatment recommendations decreased post-testing (chemotherapy: from 36-52% to 26-29%; hormonal therapy: from 48-64% to 71-74%). Physicians' confidence regarding treatment recommendations improved in all the studies after testing.; CONCLUSION: Recurrence Score testing led to changes in adjuvant chemotherapy use in approximately a third of patients, to an overall reduced chemotherapy use, and to more homogeneous decision making.

AB Allele-specific copy number analysis (ASCN) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data can greatly extend the utility of NGS beyond the identification of mutations to precisely annotate the genome for the detection of homozygous/heterozygous deletions, copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), allele-specific gains/amplifications. In addition, as targeted gene panels are increasingly used in clinical sequencing studies for the detection of 'actionable' mutations and copy number alterations to guide treatment decisions, accurate, tumor purity-, ploidy- and clonal heterogeneity-adjusted integer copy number calls are greatly needed to more reliably interpret NGS-based cancer gene copy number data in the context of clinical sequencing. We developed FACETS, an ASCN tool and open-source software with a broad application to whole genome, whole-exome, as well as targeted panel sequencing platforms. It is a fully integrated stand-alone pipeline that includes sequencing BAM file post-processing, joint segmentation of total- and allele-specific read counts, and integer copy number calls corrected for tumor purity, ploidy and clonal heterogeneity, with comprehensive output and integrated visualization. We demonstrate the application of FACETS using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-exome sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma samples. We also demonstrate its application to a clinical sequencing platform based on a targeted gene panel. © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.

AB Total population health is a key tenet of health care reform efforts, evident in initiatives such as the National Quality Strategy, shifts toward population-based payments, and community benefit requirements for tax-exempt hospitals. Representing total population health in a way that guides best practices and establishes shared accountability for geographic communities, however, remains a challenge in part because of differences in how stakeholders define populations. To better understand the landscape of potential denominators for population health, this study examined a selection of relevant geographic units. The approach included a comprehensive review of health services and public health research literature as well as recent pertinent health policy documents. Units were characterized based on whether they: exhibit "breadth" of coverage across the whole US population; are "accurate" or grounded in health care utilization patterns; are "actionable" with mechanisms for implementing funding and regulation; and promote "synergism" or effective coordination of public health and health care activities. Although other key components of a total population health unit may exist and no single identified unit possesses all of the aforementioned features, several promising candidates were identified. Specifically, healthcare coalitions link health care and public health domains to care for a geographic community, but their connection to utilization is not empiric and limited funding exists at the coalition level. Although Accountable Care Organizations do not uniformly incorporate public health or facilitate coordination across all payers or providers, they represent an effective mechanism to increase collaboration within health care systems and represent a potential building block to influence total population health.

AB Inherited retinopathies affect approximately two and a half million people globally, yet the majority of affected patients lack clear genetic diagnoses given the diverse range of genes and mutations implicated in these conditions. We present results from a next-generation sequencing study of a large inherited retinal disease patient population, with the goal of providing clear and actionable genetic diagnoses. Targeted sequencing was performed on 539 individuals from 309 inherited retinal disease pedigrees. Causative mutations were identified in the majority (57%, 176/309) of pedigrees. We report the association of many previously unreported variants with retinal disease, as well as new disease phenotypes associated with known genes, including the first association of the SLC24A1 gene with retinitis pigmentosa. Population statistics reporting the genes most commonly implicated in retinal disease in the cohort are presented, as are some diagnostic conundrums that can arise during such studies. Inherited retinal diseases represent an exemplar group of disorders for the application of panel-based next-generation sequencing as an effective tool for detection of causative mutations.

AB Mass spectrometry-based methods have been widely applied - often as the sole method - to detect mutations in human cancer specimens. We applied this approach to 52 childhood soft tissue sarcoma specimens in an attempt to identify potentially actionable mutations. This analysis revealed that 25% of the specimens harbored high-confidence calls for mutated alleles, including a mutation encoding FLT3(I836M) that was called in four cases. Given the surprisingly high frequency and unusual nature of some of the mutant alleles, we carried out ultra-deep next generation sequencing to confirm them. We confirmed only three mutations, which encoded NRAS(A18T), JAK3(V722I) and MET(R970C) in three specimens. Beyond highlighting those mutations, our findings demonstrate potential pitfalls of primarily utilizing a mass spectrometry-based approach to broadly screen for DNA sequence variants in archived, clinical-grade tumor specimens. Duplicate mass spectrometric analyses and confirmatory next generation sequencing can help diminish false positive calls, but this does not ameliorate potential false negatives due in part to evaluating a limited panel of sequence variants.

AB Redox events in which an electron and proton are exchanged in a concerted elementary step are commonly referred to as proton-coupled electron transfers (PCETs). PCETs are known to operate in numerous important biological redox processes, as well as recent inorganic technologies for small molecule activation. These studies suggest that PCET catalysis might also function as a general mode of substrate activation in organic synthesis. Over the past three years, our group has worked to advance this hypothesis and to demonstrate the synthetic utility of PCET through the development of novel catalytic radical chemistries. The central aim of these efforts has been to demonstrate the ability of PCET to homolytically activate a wide variety of common organic functional groups that are energetically inaccessible using known molecular H atom transfer catalysts. To do so, we made use of a simple formalism first introduced by Mayer and co-workers that allowed us to predict the thermodynamic capacity of any oxidant/base or reductant/acid pair to formally add or remove H· from a given substrate. With this insight, we were able to rationally select catalyst combinations thermodynamically competent to homolyze the extraordinarily strong E-H sigma-bonds found in many common protic functional groups (BDFEs > 100 kcal/mol) or to form unusually weak bonds to hydrogen via the reductive action of common organic pi-systems (BDFEs < 35 kcal/mol). These ideas were reduced to practice through the development of new catalyst systems for reductive PCET activations of ketones and oxidative PCET activation of amide N-H bonds to directly furnish reactive ketyl and amidyl radicals, respectively. In both systems, the reaction outcomes were found to be successfully predicted using the effective bond strength formalism, suggesting that these simple thermochemical considerations can provide useful and actionable insights into PCET reaction design. The ability of PCET catalysis to control enantioselectivity in free radical processes has also been established. Specifically, multisite PCET requires the formation of a pre-equilibrium hydrogen bond between the substrate and a proton donor/acceptor prior to charge transfer. We recognized that these H-bond interfaces persist following the PCET event, resulting in the formation of noncovalent complexes of the nascent radical intermediates. When chiral proton donors/acceptors are employed, this association can provide a basis for asymmetric induction in subsequent bond-forming steps. We discuss our efforts to capitalize on this understanding via the development of a catalytic protocol for enantioselective aza-pinacol cyclizations. Lastly, we highlight an alternative PCET mechanism that exploits the ability of redox-active metals to homolytically weaken the bonds in coordinated ligands, enabling nominally strong bonds (BDFEs  100 kcal) to be abstracted by weak H atom acceptors with concomitant oxidation of the metal center. This "soft homolysis" mechanism enables the generation of metalated intermediates from protic substrates under completely neutral conditions. The first example of this form of catalysis is presented in the context of a catalytic C-N bond forming reaction jointly mediated by bulky titanocene complexes and the stable nitroxyl radical TEMPO.

AB In South Africa, health promotion related to HIV/AIDS has been characterised as a component of public health prevention. It has heavily utilised global health ideology to construct promotional messages that rely on neoliberal models of individual, responsible health citizenship. However, after nearly 30 years of public health messaging, there have been only minor shifts in the country's HIV prevalence rates; it has become apparent that there is disconnect between policy, programmes, and target audiences. Debates about where this disconnect occurs tend to focus on the role of problems in biomedical knowledge translation or with structural inequalities that lead to health inequity. As debates increase, artists involved in health have emerged to address an additional reason: audience interpellation. In this article, I interrogate relationships between health promotion ideology and processes of interpellation. I suggest that disconnect between the two has roots in the tone of programming, the ways sociality is constructed within health promotion, and the kind of subject which global prevention programmes seek to constitute. Using a case study, I illustrate how public health ideology is made actionable through arts practice. While conventional health promotion programmes address populations in a way that allows individuals to distance themselves, members of South Africa's arts sector have worked to integrate prevention and care in a way that bolsters interpellation through making messages personal. The case study presents one performance but is informed by my broader research with over 20 theatrical groups conducted during 18 months of fieldwork. Analysis of the production reveals that artists act as mediators between population-level public health messages and individuals through the embodied technologies of applied theatre. However, I argue that artists also create space for participants to reimagine configurations of care, responsibility, and intimacy within health practices.

In this study, a method is developed to automatically detect and summarize ADRs from journal articles, rank them and present them to physicians in a user-friendly interface. The method studied ADRs for 6 drugs and returned on average 4.8 ADRs that were correct. The results demonstrated this method was feasible and effective. This method can be applied in clinical practice for assisting physicians to efficiently obtain information about ADRs associated with specific drugs. Automated summarization of ADR information from recent publications may facilitate translation of academic research into actionable information at point of care.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) has been on the rise since the 1990s. There has been no new treatment for advanced and recurrent disease in decades, with most women succumbing to the disease. Despite two distinct etiologies of VSCC, human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated and HPV-independent disease, there is no difference in therapeutic options.; METHODS: A literature review was carried out by searching EMBASE and Medline databases between January 1990 and March 2016 by pairing the keywords of vulvar carcinoma, vulva cancer, vulvar and vulva with molecular markers involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Molecular targets of prognostic significance were identified and targeted agents of therapeutic relevance to both HPV-independent and HPV-associated VSCC were then reviewed.; RESULTS: Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of VSCC provide insight into the future management of VSCC with molecular targeted therapies. Aberrant cell cycle activity is common in both HPV-associated and HPV-independent VSCC and is characterized by overexpression of p53, Rb and cyclin D1, supporting targeting of these protein products and their downstream pathways. Extracellular regulators of cellular activity, such as EGFR, as well as inhibitors of angiogenesis are being clinically evaluated in VSCC. HPV-independent VSCC is characterized by actionable mutations, including PI3K, CDKN2A and PTEN. In HPV-associated disease, therapeutic vaccines targeting the E6 and E7 HPV oncogenes and immune-based therapies are under investigation.; CONCLUSION: There has been a paucity of clinical trials in recent years in this neglected women's cancer. Directed therapy against cell cycle regulatory molecules and extracellular proteins and the inhibition of angiogenesis are of broad therapeutic relevance in VSCC. Therapeutic strategies that target actionable mutations should be explored. In HPV-associated VSCC, novel treatments that exploit the virology of HPV and/or enhance the host immune response merit further study. © The Author 2016.

AB Mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) are common in acute myeloid leukemia and portend a poor prognosis; thus, new therapeutic strategies are needed. The likely mechanism by which DNMT3A loss contributes to leukemogenesis is altered DNA methylation and the attendant gene expression changes; however, our current understanding is incomplete. We observed that murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which Dnmt3a had been conditionally deleted markedly overexpress the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, Dot1l. We demonstrate that Dnmt3a(-/-) HSCs have increased H3K79 methylation relative to wild-type (WT) HSCs, with the greatest increases noted at DNA methylation canyons, which are regions highly enriched for genes dysregulated in leukemia and prone to DNA methylation loss with Dnmt3a deletion. These findings led us to explore DOT1L as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DNMT3A-mutant AML. We show that pharmacologic inhibition of DOT1L resulted in decreased expression of oncogenic canyon-associated genes and led to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and terminal differentiation in DNMT3A-mutant cell lines in vitro. We show in vivo efficacy of the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ5676 in a nude rat xenograft model of DNMT3A-mutant AML. DOT1L inhibition was also effective against primary patient DNMT3A-mutant AML samples, reducing colony-forming capacity (CFC) and inducing terminal differentiation in vitro. These studies suggest that DOT1L may play a critical role in DNMT3A-mutant leukemia. With pharmacologic inhibitors of DOT1L already in clinical trials, DOT1L could be an immediately actionable therapeutic target for the treatment of this poor prognosis disease. © 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB Hypoxia is a universal driver of aggressive tumor behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Using a phosphoproteomics screen, we now show that active Akt accumulates in the mitochondria during hypoxia and phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) on Thr346 to inactivate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In turn, this pathway switches tumor metabolism toward glycolysis, antagonizes apoptosis and autophagy, dampens oxidative stress, and maintains tumor cell proliferation in the face of severe hypoxia. Mitochondrial Akt-PDK1 signaling correlates with unfavorable prognostic markers and shorter survival in glioma patients and may provide an "actionable" therapeutic target in cancer.

AB Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for approximately 20% of all adult sarcomas. Current treatment modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) all have limitations; therefore, molecularly driven studies are needed to improve the identification and increased understanding of genetic and epigenetic deregulations in LPS if we are to successfully target specific tumorigenic drivers. It can be anticipated that such biology-driven therapeutics will improve treatments by selectively deleting cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. This review will focus on several therapeutically actionable molecular markers identified in well-differentiated LPS and dedifferentiated LPS, highlighting their potential clinical applicability.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The definitive diagnosis of leptospirosis, which results from infection with spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, currently relies on the use of culture, serological testing (microscopic agglutination testing), and molecular detection. The purpose of this review is to describe new molecular diagnostics for Leptospira and discuss advancements in the use of available methods.; RECENT FINDINGS: Efforts have been focused on improving the clinical sensitivity of Leptospira detection using molecular methods. In this review, we describe a reoptimized pathogenic species-specific real-time PCR (targeting lipL32) that has demonstrated improved sensitivity, findings by two groups that real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays targeting the 16S rrs gene can improve detection, and two new loop-mediated amplification techniques. Quantitation of leptospiremia, detection in different specimen types, and the complementary roles played by molecular detection and microscopic agglutination testing will be discussed. Finally, a protocol for Leptospira strain subtyping using variable number tandem repeat targets and high-resolution melting will be described.; SUMMARY: Molecular diagnostics have an established role for the diagnosis of leptospirosis and provide an actionable diagnosis in the acute setting. The use of real-time reverse-transcription PCR for testing serum/plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, when available, may improve the detection of Leptospira without decreasing clinical specificity.

AB PURPOSE: Identifying care needs for newly enrolled or newly insured individuals is important under the Affordable Care Act. Systematically collected patient-reported information can potentially identify subgroups with specific care needs prior to service use.; METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation of 6,047 individuals who completed a 10-question needs assessment upon initial enrollment in Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), a not-for-profit integrated delivery system, through the Colorado State Individual Exchange. We used responses from the Brief Health Questionnaire (BHQ), to develop a predictive model for cost for receiving care in the top 25 percent, then applied cluster analytic techniques to identify different high-cost subpopulations. Per-member, per-month cost was measured from 6 to 12 months following BHQ response.; RESULTS: BHQ responses significantly predictive of high-cost care included self-reported health status, functional limitations, medication use, presence of 0-4 chronic conditions, self-reported emergency department (ED) use during the prior year, and lack of prior insurance. Age, gender, and deductible-based insurance product were also predictive. The largest possible range of predicted probabilities of being in the top 25 percent of cost was 3.5 percent to 96.4 percent. Within the top cost quartile, examples of potentially actionable clusters of patients included those with high morbidity, prior utilization, depression risk and financial constraints; those with high morbidity, previously uninsured individuals with few financial constraints; and relatively healthy, previously insured individuals with medication needs.; CONCLUSIONS: Applying sequential predictive modeling and cluster analytic techniques to patient-reported information can identify subgroups of individuals within heterogeneous populations who may benefit from specific interventions to optimize initial care delivery.

AB INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of infectious diseases is among the most successful areas of application of new generation sequencing technologies. The field has seen the development of numerous experimental and analytical approaches for the detection and the fine description of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms.; AREAS COVERED: Without claiming to be exhaustive with respect to all applications and methods developed over the years, this review focuses on the advantages and the issues brought by the new technologies, with an eye in particular to third generation sequencing methods. Both experimental procedures and algorithmic strategies are presented, following the most relevant publications which have led to progress in our ability of detecting infectious agents. Expert commentary: The technical advance brought by third generation sequencing platforms has the potential to significantly expand the range of diagnostic tools that will be available to clinicians. Nonetheless, the implementation of these technologies in clinical practice is still far from being actionable and will temporally follow the path undertaken by second generation methods, which still require the setup of standardized pipelines in both wet and dry laboratory procedures.

AB The time it takes for a completed manuscript to be published traditionally can be extremely lengthy. Article publication delay, which occurs in part due to constraints associated with peer review, can prevent the timely dissemination of critical and actionable data associated with new information on rare diseases or developing health concerns such as Zika virus. Preprint servers are open access online repositories housing preprint research articles that enable authors (1) to make their research immediately and freely available and (2) to receive commentary and peer review prior to journal submission. There is a growing movement of preprint advocates aiming to change the current journal publication and peer review system, proposing that preprints catalyze biomedical discovery, support career advancement, and improve scientific communication. While the number of articles submitted to and hosted by preprint servers are gradually increasing, there has been no simple way to identify biomedical research published in a preprint format, as they are not typically indexed and are only discoverable by directly searching the specific preprint server websites. To address this issue, we created a search engine that quickly compiles preprints from disparate host repositories and provides a one-stop search solution. Additionally, we developed a web application that bolsters the discovery of preprints by enabling each and every word or phrase appearing on any web site to be integrated with articles from preprint servers. This tool, search.bioPreprint, is publicly available at http://www.hsls.pitt.edu/resources/preprint.

AB The ability to distinguish pathogens from self-antigens is one of the most important functions of the immune system. However, this simple self versus non-self assignment belies the complexity of the immune response to threats. Immune responses vary widely and appropriately according to a spectrum of threats and only recently have the mechanisms for controlling this highly textured process emerged. A primary mechanism by which this controlled decision-making process is achieved is via Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and the subsequent activation of the immune response coincident with the presence of pathogenic organisms or antigens, including lipid mediators. While immune activation is important, the appropriate regulation of such responses is also critical. Recent findings indicate a parallel pathway by which responses to both viral and bacterial infections is controlled via the secretion of soluble TLR2 (sTLR2). sTLR2 is able to bind a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). sTLR2 has been detected in many bodily fluids and is thus ubiquitous in sites of pathogen appearance. Interestingly, growing evidence suggests that sTLR2 functions to sequester PAMPs and DAMPs to avoid immune activation via detection of cellular-expressed TLRs. This immune regulatory function would serve to reduce the expression of the molecules required for cellular entry, and the recruitment of target cells following infection with bacteria and viruses. This review provides an overview of sTLR2 and the research regarding the mechanisms of its immune regulatory properties. Furthermore, the role of this molecule in regulating immune activation in the context of HIV infection via sTLR2 in breast milk provides actionable insights into therapeutic targets across a variety of infectious and inflammatory states.

AB Targeted deep massive parallel sequencing has been implemented in routine molecular diagnostics for high-throughput genetic profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples. This approach is widely used to interrogate simple somatic mutations but experience with the analysis of copy number variations (CNV) is limited. Here, we retrospectively analyzed CNV in 822 cancer cases (135 melanoma, 468 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 219 colorectal cancers (CRC)). We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to CRC. The overall cohort displayed 168 (20%) amplifications in 17 druggable targets. The majority of BRAF mutant melanomas (54%) showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Subsets showed clustered deletions in ABL1, NOTCH1, RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. Most NRAS mutant melanomas (49%) harbored CNVs in other genes with CDKN2A and FGFR3 being most frequently affected. Five BRAF/NRASwt tumors had co-amplifications of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another six mutated KIT. Among all NSCLC, we identified 14 EGFRamp (with ten EGFRmut) and eight KRASamp (with seven KRASmut). KRASmut tumors displayed frequent amplifications of MYC (n=10) and MDM2 (n=5). Fifteen KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors had MET mutations/amplifications. In CRC, amplified IGF2 was most prevalent (n=13) followed by MYC (n=9). Two cases showed amplified KRAS wildtype alleles. Two of the KRASmut cases harbored amplifications of NRAS and three KRASwt cases amplification of EGFR. In conclusion, we demonstrate that our approach i) facilitates detection of CNV, ii) enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iii) uncovers new CNV of clinically actionable genes in FFPE tissue samples across cancers. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The majority of advanced breast cancers have genetic alterations that are potentially targetable with drugs. Through initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), data can be mined to provide context for next-generation sequencing (NGS) results in the landscape of advanced breast cancer. Therapies for targets other than estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and HER2, such as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, were recently approved based on efficacy in patient subpopulations, but no predictive biomarkers have been found, leaving clinicians to continue a trial-and-error approach with each patient. Next-generation sequencing identifies potentially actionable alterations in genes thought to be drivers in the cancerous process including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and mutant HER2. Epigenetically directed and immunologic therapies have also shown promise for the treatment of breast cancer via histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 and 3, programmed T cell death 1 (PD-1), and programmed T cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Identifying biomarkers to predict primary resistance in breast cancer will ultimately affect clinical decisions regarding adjuvant therapy in the first-line setting. However, the bulk of medical decision-making is currently made in the secondary resistance setting. Herein, we review the clinical potential of PI3K, AKT, FGFRs, mutant HER2, HDAC1/3, PD-1, and PD-L1 as therapeutic targets in breast cancer, focusing on the rationale for therapeutic development and the status of clinical testing.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has risen to the forefront of tumor analysis and has enabled unprecedented advances in the molecular profiling of solid tumors. Through massively parallel sequencing, previously unrecognized genomic alterations have been unveiled in many malignancies, including gynecologic cancers, thus expanding the potential repertoire for the use of targeted therapies. NGS has expanded the understanding of the genomic foundation of gynecologic malignancies and has allowed identification of germline and somatic mutations associated with cancer development, enabled tumor reclassification, and helped determine mechanisms of treatment resistance. NGS has also facilitated rationale therapeutic strategies based on actionable molecular aberrations. However, issues remain regarding cost and clinical utility. This review covers NGS analysis of and its impact thus far on gynecologic cancers, specifically ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancers.

AB INTRODUCTION: Cancer will be diagnosed in one in 1000 women during pregnancy. The outcomes of NSCLC diagnosed during pregnancy are dismal, with most patients dying within 1 year. Actionable mutations are more likely to be found among younger patients with NSCLC. However, most previous reports of NSCLC diagnosed during pregnancy did not include molecular genotyping.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients seen at our institution between 2009 and 2015 to identify women in whom NSCLC was diagnosed during pregnancy or the peripartum period and determined clinicopathologic features, including molecular genotype.; RESULTS: We identified 2422 women with NSCLC, including 160 women of reproductive age. Among the women of reproductive age, eight cases of NSCLC diagnosed during pregnancy or the peripartum period were identified; all were diagnosed in minimal or never-smokers with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Six of these patients were found to have anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements, whereas the remaining two were EGFR mutation positive. We observed a borderline significant association between a diagnosis of NSCLC during pregnancy or the peripartum period and ALK positivity (p= 0.053). All eight women in whom NSCLC was diagnosed during pregnancy or the peripartum period received treatment with genotype-directed therapies after delivery. The median overall survival has not been reached at a median follow-up of 30 months.; CONCLUSIONS: Although a diagnosis of NSCLC during pregnancy or the peripartum period is rare, diagnostic evaluation should not be delayed in pregnant women presenting with symptoms worrisome for lung cancer. Evaluation should include testing for targetable molecular alterations. Copyright © 2016 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was identified in several cancers including the recently described mammary analog secretory carcinoma (MASC) of the salivary glands and a minority of papillary thyroid carcinomas. We describe three cases of primary MASC of the thyroid gland and provide a detailed clinical and pathological characterization of the tumor morphology, immunoprofile, and genetic background. Immunohistochemistry for PAX8, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, and p63 was used to define the tumor immunophenotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6 rearrangement was performed in three, and the next-generation sequencing assay MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) was performed in two cases. Primary MASC of the thyroid occurred in two women and one man, age 47-72 years. All patients presented with high T stage, infiltrative, locally aggressive tumors with extrathyroidal extension. Two cases were associated with well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. Histologically, they appeared as low-grade tumors, resembling MASC of the salivary glands and labeled positive for mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, p63, weakly positive for PAX8, and negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed ETV6 rearrangement in all cases. In two tested cases MSK-IMPACT confirmed the presence of ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. Two patients had at least two local recurrences, one was alive with disease, and one was alive and free of disease after 14 and 17 years, respectively. The third patient was alive and free of disease after 2 years. MASC of the thyroid is histologically, immunophenotypically, and genetically similar to its salivary gland counterpart. Thyroid MASC can be associated with a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma component, supporting follicular cell origin. Clinically, these carcinomas may show frequent recurrences but are associated with long-term survival. Patients with MASC of the thyroid may potentially benefit from Trk molecular-targeted therapy.

AB Malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast are poorly understood rare neoplasms with potential for aggressive behavior. Few efficacious treatment options exist for progressed or metastatic disease. The molecular features of malignant phyllodes tumors are poorly defined, and a deeper understanding of the genetics of these tumors may shed light on pathogenesis and progression and potentially identify novel treatment approaches. We sequenced 510 cancer-related genes in 10 malignant phyllodes tumors, including 5 tumors with liposarcomatous differentiation and 1 with myxoid chondrosarcoma-like differentiation. Intratumoral heterogeneity was assessed by sequencing two separate areas in 7 tumors, including non-heterologous and heterologous components of tumors with heterologous differentiation. Activating hotspot mutations in FGFR1 were identified in 2 tumors. Additional recurrently mutated genes included TERT promoter (6/10), TP53 (4/10), PIK3CA (3/10), MED12 (3/10), SETD2 (2/10) and KMT2D (2/10). Together, genomic aberrations in FGFR/EGFR PI-3 kinase and RAS pathways were identified in 8 (80%) tumors and included mutually exclusive and potentially actionable activating FGFR1, PIK3CA and BRAF V600E mutations, inactivating TSC2 mutation, EGFR amplification and PTEN loss. Seven (70%) malignant phyllodes tumors harbored TERT aberrations (six promoter mutations, one amplification). For comparison, TERT promoter mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing in 33% borderline (n=12) and no (0%, n=8) benign phyllodes tumors (P=0.391 and P=0.013 vs malignant tumors, respectively). Genetic features specific to liposarcoma, including CDK4/MDM2 amplification, were not identified. Copy number analysis revealed intratumoral heterogeneity and evidence for divergent tumor evolution in malignant phyllodes tumors with and without heterologous differentiation. Tumors with liposarcomatous differentiation revealed more chromosomal aberrations in non-heterologous components compared with liposarcomatous components. EGFR amplification was heterogeneous and present only in the non-heterologous component of one tumor with liposarcomatous differentiation. The results identify novel pathways involved in the pathogenesis of malignant phyllodes tumors, which significantly increase our understanding of tumor biology and have potential clinical impact.

AB The use of multigene panels for the assessment of cancer susceptibility is expanding rapidly in clinical practice, particularly in the USA, despite concerns regarding the uncertain clinical validity for some gene variants and the uncertain clinical utility of most multigene panels. So-called 'moderate-penetrance' gene mutations associated with cancer susceptibility are identified in approximately 2-5% of individuals referred for clinical testing; some of these mutations are potentially actionable. Nevertheless, the appropriate management of individuals harbouring such moderate-penetrance genetic variants is unclear. The cancer risks associated with mutations in moderate-penetrance genes are lower and different than those reported for high-penetrance gene mutations (such as mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, and those associated with Lynch syndrome). The extrapolation of guidelines for the management of individuals with high-penetrance variants of cancer-susceptibility genes to the clinical care of patients with moderate-penetrance gene mutations could result in substantial harm. Thus, we provide a framework for clinical decision-making pending the development of a sufficient evidence base to document the clinical utility of the interventions for individuals with inherited moderate-penetrance gene mutations associated with an increased risk of cancer.

AB The introduction of new therapies against particular genetic mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer is a promising avenue for improving patient survival, but the target population is small. There is a need to discover new potential actionable genetic lesions, to which end, non-conventional cancer pathways, such as RNA editing, are worth exploring. Herein we show that the adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme ADAR1 undergoes gene amplification in non-small cancer cell lines and primary tumors in association with higher levels of the corresponding mRNA and protein. From a growth and invasion standpoint, the depletion of ADAR1 expression in amplified cells reduces their tumorigenic potential in cell culture and mouse models, whereas its overexpression has the opposite effects. From a functional perspective, ADAR1 overexpression enhances the editing frequencies of target transcripts such as NEIL1 and miR-381. In the clinical setting, patients with early-stage lung cancer, but harboring ADAR1 gene amplification, have poor outcomes. Overall, our results indicate a role for ADAR1 as a lung cancer oncogene undergoing gene amplification-associated activation that affects downstream RNA editing patterns and patient prognosis.

AB The implementation of effective early detection programs has significantly improved treatment, prognosis, and life expectancy in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Early-detection methods need to be developed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where progress during the past decades has remained slow. Addressing this need, the forum "Early Detection: Lessons Learned from Other Cancers" was held in November 2015 and presented by the Kenner Family Research Fund in partnership with the American Pancreatic Association. Leading experts from breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers described the development of early detection methods in their respective fields. Emerging opportunities for scientific advancement were subsequently identified that hold the greatest promise for the future of early detection in PDAC, including a 4-part strategic map of necessary actionable items. Knowledge from other fields must be applied to achieve large-scale change within the arena of PDAC. A major breakthrough in early detection of PDAC will occur only through a definitive interdisciplinary collaborative effort involving a critical mass of committed academic research institutions, government agencies, industry leaders, and philanthropies.

AB Pediatric dentists are the primary providers of dental homes for children with life-threatening and complex chronic conditions. These children are increasingly living at home and seeking health care in community-based settings, including dental offices. Pediatric dentists may feel ill prepared to assume the roles and responsibilities of a pediatric palliative care provider due to limited education and training during dental school and residency; however, they should be sensitive to the palliative care needs of children and families. The purpose of this clinical article was to highlight palliative care scenarios in pediatric dentistry and provide actionable resources to empower pediatric dentists to gather health care information, make informed ethical decisions, promote patient- and family-centered care, and prepare dentists and their dental teams for episodes of death and bereavement when providing a dental home to patients with life-threatening and complex chronic conditions.

AB Zymoseptoria tritici (previously Mycosphaerella graminicola) causes Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. The population biology of Z. tritici has been exceptionally well characterized as a result of intensive studies conducted over nearly 30 years. These studies provided important insights into the biology, epidemiology and evolutionary history of Z. tritici that will prove useful for management of STB. The well-documented, rapid adaptation of Z. tritici populations to fungicide applications and deployment of wheat cultivars carrying both major gene and quantitative resistance reflects the high evolutionary potential predicted by the large effective population size, high degree of gene flow and high levels of recombination found in field populations of Z. tritici globally. QST studies that assessed the global diversity for several important quantitative traits confirmed the adaptive potential of field populations and laid the groundwork for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies. QTL mapping elucidated the genetic architecture of each trait and led to identification of candidate genes affecting fungicide resistance, thermal adaptation, virulence, and host specialization. The insights that emerged through these analyses of Z. tritici population biology can now be used to generate actionable disease management strategies aimed at sustainably reducing losses due to STB. The high evolutionary potential found in field populations of Z. tritici requires deployment of a corresponding dynamically diverse set of control measures that integrate cultural, chemical, biological and resistance breeding strategies. In this review, we describe and prioritize STB control strategies based on current knowledge of Z. tritici population biology and propose a future research agenda oriented toward long-term STB management.

AB Kinases are therapeutically actionable targets. Kinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) improve outcomes in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but are not curative. Metastatic tumor tissue has not been comprehensively studied for kinase gene expression. Paired intra-patient kinase gene expression analysis in primary tumor (T), matched normal kidney (N) and metastatic tumor tissue (M) may assist in identifying drivers of metastasis and prioritizing therapeutic targets. We compared the expression of 519 kinase genes using NanoString in T, N and M in 35 patients to discover genes over-expressed in M compared to T and N tissue. RNA-seq data derived from ccRCC tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to demonstrate differential expression of genes in primary tumor tissue from patients that had metastasis at baseline (n = 79) compared to those that did not develop metastasis for at least 2 years (n = 187). Functional analysis was conducted to identify key signaling pathways by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Of 10 kinase genes overexpressed in metastases compared to primary tumor in the discovery cohort, 9 genes were also differentially expressed in TCGA primary tumors with metastasis at baseline compared to primary tumors without metastasis for at least 2 years: EPHB2, AURKA, GSG2, IKBKE, MELK, CSK, CHEK2, CDC7 and MAP3K8; p<0.001). The top pathways overexpressed in M tissue were pyridoxal 5'-phosphate salvage, salvage pathways of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, NF-kB signaling, NGF signaling and cell cycle control of chromosomal replication. The 9 kinase genes validated to be over-expressed in metastatic ccRCC may represent currently unrecognized but potentially actionable therapeutic targets that warrant functional validation.

AB Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a rare but aggressive malignancy with frequent recurrence and metastases. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy, but effective systemic therapies are lacking because the molecular alterations driving SC remain poorly understood. To identify these, we performed whole-exome next-generation sequencing of 409 cancer-associated genes on 27 SCs (18 primary/locally recurrent ocular, 5 paired metastatic ocular, and 4 primary extraocular) from 20 patients. In ocular SC, we identified 139 non-synonymous somatic mutations (median/lesion 3; range 0-23). Twenty-five of 139 mutations (18%) occurred in potentially clinically actionable genes in 6 of 16 patients. The most common mutations were mutations in TP53 (n = 9), RB1 (n = 6), PIK3CA (n = 2), PTEN (n = 2), ERBB2 (n = 2), and NF1 (n = 2). TP53 and RB1 mutations were restricted to ocular SC and correlated with aberrant TP53 and RB protein expression. Systematic pathway analyses demonstrated convergence of these mutations to activation of the PI3K signalling cascade, and PI3K pathway activation was confirmed in tumours with PTEN and/or PIK3CA mutations. Considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity was observed between paired primary and metastatic ocular SCs. In primary extraocular SC, we identified 77 non-synonymous somatic mutations (median/lesion 22.5; range 3-29). This overall higher mutational load was attributed to a microsatellite instability phenotype in three of four patients and somatically acquired mutations in mismatch repair genes in two of four patients. Eighteen of 77 mutations (23%) were in potentially clinically actionable genes in three of four patients, including BTK, FGFR2, PDGFRB, HRAS, and NF1 mutations. Identification of potentially clinically actionable mutations in 9 of 20 SC patients (45%) underscores the importance of next-generation sequencing to expand the spectrum of genotype-matched targeted therapies. Frequent activation of PI3K signalling pathways provides a strong rationale for application of mTOR inhibitors in the management of this disease.

AB BACKGROUND: In the changing health care environment, health systems, hospitals, and health care providers must focus on improving efficiency to meet an increasing demand for high-quality, low-cost health care. Much has been written about strategies and efforts to improve efficiency in the perioperative periods, yet the time when the patient is in the operating room-the intraoperative period-has received less attention. Yet, this is the period in which surgeons may have the most influence.; METHODS: Systematically review published efforts to improve intraoperative efficiency; assess the outcomes of these efforts, and propose standardized reporting of future studies.; RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. These divided naturally into small (single operative team), medium (multi-operative team), and large (institutional) interventions. Most studies used time or money as their metric for efficiency, though others were used as well.; CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial opportunity to enhance operating room efficiency during the intraoperative period. Surgeons may have a particular role in procedural efficiency, which has been relatively unstudied. Common themes were standardizing tasks, collecting and using actionable data, and maintaining effective team communication. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) is increasingly used in oncology for therapeutic decision-making, but is not yet widely used for prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to determine current clinical utility of tNGS for prostate cancer management.; METHODS: Seven academic genitourinary medical oncologists recruited and consented patients with prostate cancer, largely with unusual clinical and/or pathologic features, from 2013 to 2015. UW-OncoPlex was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumors and/or metastatic biopsies. Results were discussed at a multidisciplinary precision tumor board prior to communicating to patients. FFPE tumor DNA was extracted for tNGS analysis of 194 cancer-associated genes. Results, multidisciplinary discussion, and treatment changes were recorded.; RESULTS: Forty-five patients consented and 42 had reportable results. Findings included mutations in genes frequently observed in prostate cancer. We also found alterations in genes where targeted treatments were available and/or in clinical trials. 4/42 (10%) cases, change in treatment directly resulted from tNGS and multidisciplinary discussion. In 30/42 (71%) cases additional options were available but not pursued and/or were pending. Notably, 10/42 (24%) of patients harbored suspected germline mutations in moderate or high-penetrance cancer risk genes, including BRCA2, TP53, ATM, and CHEK2. One patient's tumor had bi-allelic MSH6 mutation and microsatellite instability. In total, 34/42 (81%) cases resulted in some measure of treatment actionability. Limitations include small size and limited clinical outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: Targeted NGS tumor sequencing may help guide immediate and future treatment options for men with prostate cancer. A substantial subset had germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes with potential clinical management implications for men and their relatives.

AB Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are oncogenic DNA viruses implicated in squamous cell carcinomas of several anatomic sites, as well as endocervical adenocarcinomas. Identification of HPV is an actionable finding in some carcinomas, potentially influencing tumor classification, prognosis, and management. We incorporated capture probes for oncogenic HPV strains 16 and 18 into a broader next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel designed to identify actionable mutations in solid malignancies. A total of 21 head and neck, genitourinary, and gynecologic squamous cell carcinomas and endocervical adenocarcinomas were sequenced as part of the UNCSeq project. Using p16 immunohistochemical results as the gold standard, we set a cutoff for proportion of aligned HPV reads that maximized performance of our NGS assay (92% sensitive, 100% specific for HPV). These results suggest that sequencing of oncogenic pathogens can be incorporated into targeted NGS panels, extending the clinical utility of genomic assays.

AB PURPOSE: The implementation of genomic-based medicine is hindered by unresolved questions regarding data privacy and delivery of interpreted results to health-care practitioners. We used DNA-based prediction of HIV-related outcomes as a model to explore critical issues in clinical genomics.; METHODS: We genotyped 4,149 markers in HIV-positive individuals. Variants allowed for prediction of 17 traits relevant to HIV medical care, inference of patient ancestry, and imputation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. Genetic data were processed under a privacy-preserving framework using homomorphic encryption, and clinical reports describing potentially actionable results were delivered to health-care providers.; RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were included in the study. We demonstrated the feasibility of encrypting a large number of genetic markers, inferring patient ancestry, computing monogenic and polygenic trait risks, and reporting results under privacy-preserving conditions. The average execution time of a multimarker test on encrypted data was 865ms on a standard computer. The proportion of tests returning potentially actionable genetic results ranged from 0 to 54%.; CONCLUSIONS: The model of implementation presented herein informs on strategies to deliver genomic test results for clinical care. Data encryption to ensure privacy helps to build patient trust, a key requirement on the road to genomic-based medicine.Genet Med 18 8, 814-822.

AB Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessively inherited beta-hemoglobinopathy causing a sickling hemoglobin (HbS) to be expressed in the erythrocyte. Due its unique biophysical properties and tendency to form polymers in deoxygenated conditions, HbS causes dramatic erythrocyte deformation and damage ultimately leading to diffuse hemolysis, vasco-occlusion, and vasculopathy in affected individuals. Albeit SCD was the first molecular disease identified in the human several decades ago, the progress in caring for patients with SCD has been globally limited and faces considerable biological, medical, psychological, and economic challenges. The aim of this review is to illustrate the opportunities lying ahead for proteomic discovery in SCD. It also establishes a tentative conceptual framework for clinically oriented investigations. The ultimate target is the translation of findings into validated and actionable improvements at the bedside. Thanks to significant technological advances, proteomics is poised to play an important role for patients affected by hematological disorders, and SCD could be a paradigm for impactful research. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB Massive investment and technological advances in the collection of extensive and longitudinal information on thousands of Alzheimer patients results in large amounts of data. These "big-data" databases can potentially advance CNS research and drug development. However, although necessary, they are not sufficient, and we posit that they must be matched with analytical methods that go beyond retrospective data-driven associations with various clinical phenotypes. Although these empirically derived associations can generate novel and useful hypotheses, they need to be organically integrated in a quantitative understanding of the pathology that can be actionable for drug discovery and development. We argue that mechanism-based modeling and simulation approaches, where existing domain knowledge is formally integrated using complexity science and quantitative systems pharmacology can be combined with data-driven analytics to generate predictive actionable knowledge for drug discovery programs, target validation, and optimization of clinical development.

AB Many disease-modifying clinical development programs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed to date, and development of new and advanced preclinical models that generate actionable knowledge is desperately needed. This review reports on computer-based modeling and simulation approach as a powerful tool in AD research. Statistical data-analysis techniques can identify associations between certain data and phenotypes, such as diagnosis or disease progression. Other approaches integrate domain expertise in a formalized mathematical way to understand how specific components of pathology integrate into complex brain networks. Private-public partnerships focused on data sharing, causal inference and pathway-based analysis, crowdsourcing, and mechanism-based quantitative systems modeling represent successful real-world modeling examples with substantial impact on CNS diseases. Similar to other disease indications, successful real-world examples of advanced simulation can generate actionable support of drug discovery and development in AD, illustrating the value that can be generated for different stakeholders.

AB OBJECTIVES: Quantification and early identification of unplanned readmission risk have the potential to improve the quality of care during hospitalization and after discharge. However, high dimensionality, sparsity, and class imbalance of electronic health data and the complexity of risk quantification, challenge the development of accurate predictive models. Predictive models require a certain level of interpretability in order to be applicable in real settings and create actionable insights. This paper aims to develop accurate and interpretable predictive models for readmission in a general pediatric patient population, by integrating a data-driven model (sparse logistic regression) and domain knowledge based on the international classification of diseases 9th-revision clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) hierarchy of diseases. Additionally, we propose a way to quantify the interpretability of a model and inspect the stability of alternative solutions.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was conducted on >66,000 pediatric hospital discharge records from California, State Inpatient Databases, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project between 2009 and 2011. We incorporated domain knowledge based on the ICD-9-CM hierarchy in a data driven, Tree-Lasso regularized logistic regression model, providing the framework for model interpretation. This approach was compared with traditional Lasso logistic regression resulting in models that are easier to interpret by fewer high-level diagnoses, with comparable prediction accuracy.; RESULTS: The results revealed that the use of a Tree-Lasso model was as competitive in terms of accuracy (measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve-AUC) as the traditional Lasso logistic regression, but integration with the ICD-9-CM hierarchy of diseases provided more interpretable models in terms of high-level diagnoses. Additionally, interpretations of models are in accordance with existing medical understanding of pediatric readmission. Best performing models have similar performances reaching AUC values 0.783 and 0.779 for traditional Lasso and Tree-Lasso, respectfully. However, information loss of Lasso models is 0.35 bits higher compared to Tree-Lasso model.; CONCLUSIONS: We propose a method for building predictive models applicable for the detection of readmission risk based on Electronic Health records. Integration of domain knowledge (in the form of ICD-9-CM taxonomy) and a data-driven, sparse predictive algorithm (Tree-Lasso Logistic Regression) resulted in an increase of interpretability of the resulting model. The models are interpreted for the readmission prediction problem in general pediatric population in California, as well as several important subpopulations, and the interpretations of models comply with existing medical understanding of pediatric readmission. Finally, quantitative assessment of the interpretability of the models is given, that is beyond simple counts of selected low-level features. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate assessment of genetic variation in human DNA sequencing studies remains a nontrivial challenge in clinical genomics and genome informatics. Ascribing functional roles and/or clinical significances to single nucleotide variants identified from a next-generation sequencing study is an important step in genome interpretation. Experimental characterization of all the observed functional variants is yet impractical; thus, the prediction of functional and/or regulatory impacts of the various mutations using in silico approaches is an important step toward the identification of functionally significant or clinically actionable variants. The relationships between genotypes and the expressed phenotypes are multilayered and biologically complex; such relationships present numerous challenges and at the same time offer various opportunities for the design of in silico variant assessment strategies. Over the past decade, many bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict functional consequences of single nucleotide variants in the protein coding regions. In this review, we provide an overview of the bioinformatics resources for the prediction, annotation and visualization of coding single nucleotide variants. We discuss the currently available approaches and major challenges from the perspective of protein sequence, structure, function and interactions that require consideration when interpreting the impact of putatively functional variants. We also discuss the relevance of incorporating integrated workflows for predicting the biomedical impact of the functionally important variations encoded in a genome, exome or transcriptome. Finally, we propose a framework to classify variant assessment approaches and strategies for incorporation of variant assessment within electronic health records. © The Author 2015.

AB In the past several years, immunotherapy has emerged as a viable treatment option for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without actionable driver mutations that have progressed on standard chemotherapy. We are also beginning to understand the methods of immune evasion employed by NSCLC which likely contribute to the 20% response rate to immunotherapy. It is also yet unclear what tumor or patient factors predict response to immunotherapy. The objectives of this review are (1) review the immunogenicity of NSCLC (2) describe the mechanisms of immune evasion (3) summarize efforts to target the anti-program death-1 (PD-1) and anti-program death-ligand 1(PD-L1) pathway (4) outline determinants of response to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and (5) discuss potential future areas for research. © 2016 The Authors.

AB PURPOSE: Geisinger Health System (GHS) provides an ideal platform for Precision Medicine. Key elements are the integrated health system, stable patient population, and electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure. In 2007, Geisinger launched MyCode, a system-wide biobanking program to link samples and EHR data for broad research use.; METHODS: Patient-centered input into MyCode was obtained using participant focus groups. Participation in MyCode is based on opt-in informed consent and allows recontact, which facilitates collection of data not in the EHR and, since 2013, the return of clinically actionable results to participants. MyCode leverages Geisinger's technology and clinical infrastructure for participant tracking and sample collection.; RESULTS: MyCode has a consent rate of >85%, with more than 90,000 participants currently and with ongoing enrollment of ~4,000 per month. MyCode samples have been used to generate molecular data, including high-density genotype and exome sequence data. Genotype and EHR-derived phenotype data replicate previously reported genetic associations.; CONCLUSION: The MyCode project has created resources that enable a new model for translational research that is faster, more flexible, and more cost-effective than traditional clinical research approaches. The new model is scalable and will increase in value as these resources grow and are adopted across multiple research platforms.Genet Med 18 9, 906-913.

AB BACKGROUND: Families must process complex information related to neonatal encephalopathy and therapeutic hypothermia.; METHODS: In this mixed methods study, semi-structured interviews were performed with parents whose infants were enrolled in an existing longitudinal cohort study of therapeutic hypothermia between 2011 and 2014.; RESULTS: Thematic saturation was achieved after 20 interviews. Parental experience of communicating with clinicians was characterized by 3 principle themes. Theme 1 highlighted that a fragmented communication process mirrored the chaotic maternal and neonatal course. Parents often received key information about neonatal encephalopathy and therapeutic hypothermia from maternal clinicians. Infant medical information was often given to 1 family member (60%), who felt burdened by the responsibility to relay that information to others. Families universally valued the role of the bedside nurse, who was perceived as the primary source of communication for most (75%) families. Theme 2 encompassed the challenges of discussing the complex therapy of therapeutic hypothermia: families appreciated clinicians who used lay language and provided written material, and they often felt overwhelmed by technical information that made it hard to understand the "big picture" of their infant's medical course. Theme 3 involved the uncertain prognosis after neonatal encephalopathy. Parents appreciated specific expectations about their infant's long-term development, and experienced long-term distress about prognostic uncertainty.; CONCLUSIONS: Communicating complex and large volumes of information in the midst of perinatal crisis presents inherent challenges for both clinicians and families. We identified an actionable set of communication challenges that can be addressed with targeted interventions. Copyright © 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB The identification of mutations that guide therapy selection for patients with cancer is now routine in many clinical centres. The majority of assays used for solid tumour profiling use DNA sequencing to interrogate somatic point mutations because they are relatively easy to identify and interpret. Many cancers, however, including high-grade serous ovarian, oesophageal, and small-cell lung cancer, are driven by somatic structural variants that are not measured by these assays. Therefore, there is currently an unmet need for clinical assays that can cheaply and rapidly profile structural variants in solid tumours. In this review we survey the landscape of 'actionable' structural variants in cancer and identify promising detection strategies based on massively-parallel sequencing. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB INTRODUCTION: Nursing staffing levels in hospitals appear to be associated with improved patient outcomes. National guidance indicates that the triangulation of information from workforce planning and deployment technologies (WPTs; eg, the Safer Nursing Care Tool) and 'local knowledge' is important for managers to achieve appropriate staffing levels for better patient outcomes. Although WPTs provide managers with predictive information about future staffing requirements, ensuring patient safety and quality care also requires the consideration of information from other sources in real time. Yet little attention has been given to how to support managers to implement WPTs in practice. Given this lack of understanding, this evidence synthesis is designed to address the research question: managers' use of WPTs and their impacts on nurse staffing and patient care: what works, for whom, how and in what circumstances?; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To explain how WPTs may work and in what contexts, we will conduct a realist evidence synthesis through sourcing relevant evidence, and consulting with stakeholders about the impacts of WPTs on health and relevant public service fields. The review will be in 4 phases over 18 months. Phase 1: we will construct an initial theoretical framework that provides plausible explanations of what works about WPTs. Phase 2: evidence retrieval, review and synthesis guided by the theoretical framework; phase 3: testing and refining of programme theories, to determine their relevance; phase 4: formulating actionable recommendations about how WPTs should be implemented in clinical practice.; ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been gained from the study's institutional sponsors. Ethical review from the National Health Service (NHS) is not required; however research and development permissions will be obtained. Findings will be disseminated through stakeholder engagement and knowledge mobilisation activities. The synthesis will develop an explanatory programme theory of the implementation and impact of nursing WPTs, and practical guidance for nurse managers.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016038132.

AB OBJECTIVES: This evidence review was conducted to understand how and why workforce development interventions can improve the skills and care standards of support workers in older people's services.; DESIGN: Following recognised realist synthesis principles, the review was completed by (1) development of an initial programme theory; (2) retrieval, review and synthesis of evidence relating to interventions designed to develop the support workforce; (3) 'testing out' the synthesis findings to refine the programme theories, and establish their practical relevance/potential for implementation through stakeholder interviews; and (4) forming actionable recommendations.; PARTICIPANTS: Stakeholders who represented services, commissioners and older people were involved in workshops in an advisory capacity, and 10 participants were interviewed during the theory refinement process.; RESULTS: Eight context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified which cumulatively comprise a new programme theory about 'what works' to support workforce development in older people's services. The CMOs indicate that the design and delivery of workforce development includes how to make it real to the work of those delivering support to older people; the individual support worker's personal starting points and expectations of the role; how to tap into support workers' motivations; the use of incentivisation; joining things up around workforce development; getting the right mix of people engaged in the design and delivery of workforce development programmes/interventions; taking a planned approach to workforce development, and the ways in which components of interventions reinforce one another, increasing the potential for impacts to embed and spread across organisations.; CONCLUSIONS: It is important to take a tailored approach to the design and delivery of workforce development that is mindful of the needs of older people, support workers, health and social care services and the employing organisations within which workforce development operates. Workforce development interventions need to balance the technical, professional and emotional aspects of care.; TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42013006283.

AB Recent genome sequencing efforts have identified millions of somatic mutations in cancer. However, the functional impact of most variants is poorly understood. Here we characterize 194 somatic mutations identified in primary lung adenocarcinomas. We present an expression-based variant-impact phenotyping (eVIP) method that uses gene expression changes to distinguish impactful from neutral somatic mutations. eVIP identified 69% of mutations analyzed as impactful and 31% as functionally neutral. A subset of the impactful mutations induces xenograft tumor formation in mice and/or confers resistance to cellular EGFR inhibition. Among these impactful variants are rare somatic, clinically actionable variants including EGFR S645C, ARAF S214C and S214F, ERBB2 S418T, and multiple BRAF variants, demonstrating that rare mutations can be functionally important in cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Technological advances enable the cost-effective acquisition of Multi-Modal Data Sets (MMDS) composed of measurements for multiple, high-dimensional data types obtained from a common set of bio-samples. The joint analysis of the data matrices associated with the different data types of a MMDS should provide a more focused view of the biology underlying complex diseases such as cancer that would not be apparent from the analysis of a single data type alone. As multi-modal data rapidly accumulate in research laboratories and public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the translation of such data into clinically actionable knowledge has been slowed by the lack of computational tools capable of analyzing MMDSs. Here, we describe the Joint Analysis of Many Matrices by ITeration (JAMMIT) algorithm that jointly analyzes the data matrices of a MMDS using sparse matrix approximations of rank-1.; METHODS: The JAMMIT algorithm jointly approximates an arbitrary number of data matrices by rank-1 outer-products composed of "sparse" left-singular vectors (eigen-arrays) that are unique to each matrix and a right-singular vector (eigen-signal) that is common to all the matrices. The non-zero coefficients of the eigen-arrays identify small subsets of variables for each data type (i.e., signatures) that in aggregate, or individually, best explain a dominant eigen-signal defined on the columns of the data matrices. The approximation is specified by a single "sparsity" parameter that is selected based on false discovery rate estimated by permutation testing. Multiple signals of interest in a given MDDS are sequentially detected and modeled by iterating JAMMIT on "residual" data matrices that result from a given sparse approximation.; RESULTS: We show that JAMMIT outperforms other joint analysis algorithms in the detection of multiple signatures embedded in simulated MDDS. On real multimodal data for ovarian and liver cancer we show that JAMMIT identified multi-modal signatures that were clinically informative and enriched for cancer-related biology.; CONCLUSIONS: Sparse matrix approximations of rank-1 provide a simple yet effective means of jointly reducing multiple, big data types to a small subset of variables that characterize important clinical and/or biological attributes of the bio-samples from which the data were acquired.

AB PURPOSE: We undertook a multidimensional clinical genomics study of children and adolescent young adults with relapsed and refractory cancers to determine the feasibility of genome-guided precision therapy.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with non-central nervous system solid tumors underwent a combination of whole exome sequencing (WES), whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), and high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis of the tumor, with WES of matched germline DNA. Clinically actionable alterations were identified as a reportable germline mutation, a diagnosis change, or a somatic event (including a single nucleotide variant, an indel, an amplification, a deletion, or a fusion gene), which could be targeted with drugs in existing clinical trials or with FDA-approved drugs.; RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients in 20 diagnostic categories were enrolled from 2010 to 2014. Ages ranged from 7 months to 25 years old. Seventy-three percent of the patients had prior chemotherapy, and the tumors from these patients with relapsed or refractory cancers had a higher mutational burden than that reported in the literature. Thirty patients (51% of total) had clinically actionable mutations, of which 24 (41%) had a mutation that was currently targetable in a clinical trial setting, 4 patients (7%) had a change in diagnosis, and 7 patients (12%) had a reportable germline mutation.; CONCLUSIONS: We found a remarkably high number of clinically actionable mutations in 51% of the patients, and 12% with significant germline mutations. We demonstrated the clinical feasibility of next-generation sequencing in a diverse population of relapsed and refractory pediatric solid tumors.

AB Cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, and is the area most targeted in precision medicine. Recent development of high-throughput methods enables detailed omics analysis of the molecular mechanisms underpinning tumor biology. These studies have identified clinically actionable mutations, gene and protein expression patterns associated with prognosis, and provided further insights into the molecular mechanisms indicative of cancer biology and new therapeutics strategies such as immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the techniques used for tumor omics analysis, recapitulate the key findings in cancer omics studies, and point to areas requiring further research on precision oncology. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB PURPOSE: A priority of MUSIC (Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative) is to improve patient outcomes after radical prostatectomy. As part of these efforts we developed a novel system that uses unambiguous events to define an uncomplicated 30-day postoperative recovery and compares these outcomes across diverse urology practices.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: MUSIC used a consensus approach to develop an uncomplicated recovery pathway comprising a set of precise perioperative events that are reliably measured and collectively reflect resource utilization, technical complications and coordination of care. Events that occurred outside the uncomplicated recovery pathway were considered deviations, including rectal injury, high blood loss, extended length of stay, prolonged drain or catheter placement, catheter replacement, hospital readmission or mortality. For men undergoing radical prostatectomy trained abstractors prospectively recorded clinical and perioperative data in an electronic registry. When a deviation from the NOTES (Notable Outcomes and Trackable Events after Surgery) pathway occurred, precipitating events were described by abstractors and we analyzed the events.; RESULTS: From April 2014 through July 2015 a total of 2,245 radical prostatectomies were performed by 100 surgeons in a total of 37 diverse participating MUSIC practices. In the 29 practices in which 10 or more radical prostatectomies were performed during the interval analyzed the risk adjusted deviation rate ranged from 0.0% to 46.1% (p <0.0001). Anastomotic and gastrointestinal events were contributing factors in 50.2% of deviated cases.; CONCLUSIONS: The novel NOTES system provides comparative data on unambiguous and actionable short-term outcomes after radical prostatectomy. The observed variation in outcomes across practices suggests opportunities for quality improvement initiatives. Decreasing anastomotic and gastrointestinal events represents a high impact opportunity for initial quality improvement efforts.

AB Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are becoming increasingly prevalent as a method for low cost and portable biomechanical analysis. However, to date they have not been accepted into routine clinical practice. This is often due to a disconnect between translating the data collected by the sensors into meaningful and actionable information for end users. This paper outlines the work completed by our group in attempting to achieve this. We discuss the conceptual framework involved in our work, the methodological approach taken in analysing sensor signals and discuss possible application models. Our work indicates that IMU based systems have the potential to bridge the gap between laboratory and clinical movement analysis. Future studies will focus on collecting a diverse range of movement data and using more sophisticated data analysis techniques to refine systems.

AB False and non-actionable alarms in critical care can be reduced by developing algorithms which assess the trueness of an arrhythmia alarm from a bedside monitor. Computational approaches that automatically identify artefacts in ECG signals are an important branch of physiological signal processing which tries to address this issue. Signal quality indices (SQIs) derived considering differences between artefacts which occur in ECG signals and normal QRS morphology have the potential to discriminate pathologically different arrhythmic ECG segments as artefacts. Using ECG signals from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015 training set, we studied previously reported ECG SQIs in the scientific literature to differentiate ECG segments with artefacts from arrhythmic ECG segments. We found that the ability of SQIs to discriminate between ECG artefacts and arrhythmic ECG varies based on arrhythmia type since the pathology of each arrhythmic ECG waveform is different. Therefore, to reduce the risk of SQIs classifying arrhythmic events as noise it is important to validate and test SQIs with databases that include arrhythmias. Arrhythmia specific SQIs may also minimize the risk of misclassifying arrhythmic events as noise.

AB This case study evaluates and tracks vitality of a city (Seattle), based on a data-driven approach, using strategic, robust, and sustainable metrics. This case study was collaboratively conducted by the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA) and CDO Analytics teams. The DSA is a nonprofit organization focused on making the city of Seattle and its Downtown a healthy and vibrant place to Live, Work, Shop, and Play. DSA primarily operates through public policy advocacy, community and business development, and marketing. In 2010, the organization turned to CDO Analytics ( cdoanalytics.org ) to develop a process that can guide and strategically focus DSA efforts and resources for maximal benefit to the city of Seattle and its Downtown. CDO Analytics was asked to develop clear, easily understood, and robust metrics for a baseline evaluation of the health of the city, as well as for ongoing monitoring and comparisons of the vitality, sustainability, and growth. The DSA and CDO Analytics teams strategized on how to effectively assess and track the vitality of Seattle and its Downtown. The two teams filtered a variety of data sources, and evaluated the veracity of multiple diverse metrics. This iterative process resulted in the development of a small number of strategic, simple, reliable, and sustainable metrics across four pillars of activity: Live, Work, Shop, and Play. Data during the 5 years before 2010 were used for the development of the metrics and model and its training, and data during the 5 years from 2010 and on were used for testing and validation. This work enabled DSA to routinely track these strategic metrics, use them to monitor the vitality of Downtown Seattle, prioritize improvements, and identify new value-added programs. As a result, the four-pillar approach became an integral part of the data-driven decision-making and execution of the Seattle community's improvement activities. The approach described in this case study is actionable, robust, inexpensive, and easy to adopt and sustain. It can be applied to cities, districts, counties, regions, states, or countries, enabling cross-comparisons and improvements of vitality, sustainability, and growth.

AB Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive and heterogeneous malignancy harboring frequent targetable activating somatic mutations. Emerging evidence suggests that circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be used to detect somatic variants in DLBCL using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments. In this proof-of-concept study, we chose to develop simple and valuable digital PCR (dPCR) assays for the detection of recurrent exportin-1 (XPO1) E571K, EZH2 Y641N, and MYD88 L265P mutations in DLBCL patients, thereby identifying patients most likely to potentially benefit from targeted therapies. We demonstrated that our dPCR assays were sufficiently sensitive to detect rare XPO1, EZH2, and MYD88 mutations in plasma cfDNA, with a sensitivity of 0.05%. cfDNA somatic mutation detection by dPCR seems to be a promising technique in the management of DLBCL, in addition to NGS experiments.

AB Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a fatal hematological cancer. The genetic abnormalities underlying AML are extremely heterogeneous among patients, making prognosis and treatment selection very difficult. While clinical proteomics data has the potential to improve prognosis accuracy, thus far, the quantitative means to do so have yet to be developed. Here we report the results and insights gained from the DREAM 9 Acute Myeloid Prediction Outcome Prediction Challenge (AML-OPC), a crowdsourcing effort designed to promote the development of quantitative methods for AML prognosis prediction. We identify the most accurate and robust models in predicting patient response to therapy, remission duration, and overall survival. We further investigate patient response to therapy, a clinically actionable prediction, and find that patients that are classified as resistant to therapy are harder to predict than responsive patients across the 31 models submitted to the challenge. The top two performing models, which held a high sensitivity to these patients, substantially utilized the proteomics data to make predictions. Using these models, we also identify which signaling proteins were useful in predicting patient therapeutic response.

AB Cutaneous cylindroma is a rare benign tumour that occasionally turns into malignant cylindrocarcinoma. The cancer can be sporadic or emerge in the context of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS), an inheritable condition characterized by mutation of the gene CYLD, encoding a tumour suppressor protein that controls the activity of the transcription factor NF-kB. Sporadic cylindromas present histological features shared with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a head and neck cancer originating from salivary or other exocrine glands. Like ACCs, sporadic cylindromas express, although at lower frequency, the aberrant fusion transcript MYB-NFIB. In a paper recently published in the Journal of Pathology, the research teams led by Neil Rajan and Goran Stenman demonstrate that CYLD-defective cyclindromas in BSS patients are negative for the MYB-NFIB fusion. Only the wild-type MYB oncoprotein is activated in the majority of these tumours. RNA interference studies in cells derived from BSS patients indicate that ablating MYB expression results in a striking reduction of cylindroma cell proliferation, suggesting that MYB plays a pivotal role in the biology of this cancer. The take-home message of the study is that activation of MYB, in its wild-type form or fusion derivatives, is a common feature of spontaneous and hereditary cylindromas, constituting a potentially actionable therapeutic target.

AB Clinician attitudes toward multiplexed genomic testing may be vital to the success of translational programs. We surveyed clinicians at an academic medical center about their views on a large pharmacogenomics implementation, the PREDICT (Pharmacogenomic Resource for Enhanced Decisions in Care and Treatment) program. Participants were asked about test ordering, major factors influencing use of results, expectations of efficacy and responsibility for applying results to patient care. Virtually all respondents (99%) agreed that pharmacogenomics variants influence patients' response to drug therapy. The majority (92%) favored immediate, active notification when a clinically significant drug-genome interaction was present. However, clinicians were divided on which providers were responsible for acting on a result when a prescription change was indicated and whether patients should be directly notified of a significant result. We concluded genotype results were valued for tailoring prescriptions, but clinicians do not agree on how to appropriately assign clinical responsibility for actionable results from a multiplexed panel.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 11 August 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.57.

AB Next-generation sequencing has challenged the consensus that predictive testing should not be performed on asymptomatic minors for conditions that are not medically actionable in childhood. While the available literature suggests that most parents want access to incidental findings discovered in genomic sequencing, there is little information regarding adolescents' views. This study's goal is to determine adolescent views regarding the disclosure of incidental findings for adult onset conditions that are not medically actionable in childhood. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of students enrolled in 7-12th grade science classes in three Cincinnati public schools. Most (235 of 282, 83%) students wanted access to non-actionable incidental findings. These participants most frequently (38%) endorsed future planning as the reason for disclosure. Seventy-two percent of students believed they should participate in the decision making process. Seventy-three percent of students believed that parents of children less than 12 years old should have access to this information. Adolescents want to have access to and participate in decisions about incidental findings. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The "pediatric targeted therapy" (PTT) program aims to identify the presence and activity of druggable targets and evaluate the clinical benefit of a personalized treatment approach in relapsed or progressive tumors on an individual basis. 10 markers (HDAC2, HR23B, p-AKT, p-ERK, p-S6, p-EGFR, PDGFR-alpha/beta, p53 and BRAFV600E) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Pediatric patients with tumors independent of the histological diagnosis, with relapse or progression after treatment according to standard protocols were included. N=61/145 (42%) cases were eligible for analysis between 2009 and 2013, the most common entities being brain tumors. Immunohistochemical stainings were evaluated by the H-Score (0-300). In 93% of the cases potentially actionable targets were identified. The expressed or activated pathways were histone deacetylase (HDACs; 83.0% of cases positive), EGFR (87.2%), PDGFR (75.9%), p53 (50.0%), MAPK/ERK (43.3%) and PI3K/mTOR (36.1%). Follow-up revealed partial or full implementation of PTT results in treatment decision-making in 41% of the cases. Prolonged disease stabilization responses in single cases were noticed, however, response rates did not differ from cases treated with other modalities. Further studies evaluating the feasibility and clinical benefit of personalized diagnostic approaches using paraffin material are warranted. © 2015 International Society of Neuropathology.

AB PURPOSE: Pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, whose biologic relationship to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) versus non-SCLC (NSCLC) remains unclear, contributing to uncertainty regarding optimal clinical management. To clarify these relationships, we analyzed genomic alterations in LCNEC compared with other major lung carcinoma types.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: LCNEC (n = 45) tumor/normal pairs underwent targeted next-generation sequencing of 241 cancer genes by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) platform and comprehensive histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical analysis. Genomic data were compared with MSK-IMPACT analysis of other lung carcinoma histologies (n = 242).; RESULTS: Commonly altered genes in LCNEC included TP53 (78%), RB1 (38%), STK11 (33%), KEAP1 (31%), and KRAS (22%). Genomic profiles segregated LCNEC into 2 major and 1 minor subsets: SCLC-like (n = 18), characterized by TP53+RB1 co-mutation/loss and other SCLC-type alterations, including MYCL amplification; NSCLC-like (n = 25), characterized by the lack of coaltered TP53+RB1 and nearly universal occurrence of NSCLC-type mutations (STK11, KRAS, and KEAP1); and carcinoid-like (n = 2), characterized by MEN1 mutations and low mutation burden. SCLC-like and NSCLC-like subsets revealed several clinicopathologic differences, including higher proliferative activity in SCLC-like tumors (P < 0.0001) and exclusive adenocarcinoma-type differentiation marker expression in NSCLC-like tumors (P = 0.005). While exhibiting predominant similarity with lung adenocarcinoma, NSCLC-like LCNEC harbored several distinctive genomic alterations, including more frequent mutations in NOTCH family genes (28%), implicated as key regulators of neuroendocrine differentiation.; CONCLUSIONS: LCNEC is a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors, comprising distinct subsets with genomic signatures of SCLC, NSCLC (predominantly adenocarcinoma), and rarely, highly proliferative carcinoids. Recognition of these subsets may inform the classification and management of LCNEC patients. Clin Cancer Res; 22(14); 3618-29. ©2016 AACR. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and minorities have the worst survival. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying survival disparities have not been elucidated.; METHODS: In a retrospective study, we assessed association between HNSCC early death (<2 years) and 208 somatic mutations of 10 cancer-related genes in 214 patients: 98 non-Hispanic whites (46%), 72 Hispanic whites (34%), and 44 African Americans (20%).; RESULTS: Hispanic whites and African Americans had significantly higher mutation rates for EGFR, HRAS, KRAS, and TP53. HNSCC early death was significantly associated with 3+ mutations (odds ratio [OR]=2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.16, 6.69), NOTCH1 mutations in non-Hispanic whites (OR=5.51; 95% CI=1.22-24.83) and TP53 mutations in Hispanic whites (OR = 3.84; 95% CI = 1.08-13.68) in multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, tumor site, and tumor stage.; CONCLUSION: We have provided the proof-of-principal data to link racial/ethnic-specific somatic mutations and HNSCC prognosis and pave the way for precision medicine to overcome HNSCC survival disparities. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is essential for quality care. Understanding residents' level of competence is a critical first step to designing targeted curricula and workplace learning activities. In this needs assessment, we measured residents' IPC competence using specifically designed Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) cases and surveyed residents regarding training needs.; METHODS: We developed three cases to capture IPC competence in the context of physician-nurse collaboration. A trained actor played the role of the nurse (Standardized Nurse - SN). The Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) framework was used to create a ten-item behaviorally anchored IPC performance checklist (scored on a three-point scale: done, partially done, well done) measuring four generic domains: values/ethics; roles/responsibilities; interprofessional communication; and teamwork. Specific skills required for each scenario were also assessed, including teamwork communication (SBAR and CUS) and patient-care-focused tasks. In addition to evaluating IPC skills, the SN assessed communication, history-taking and physical exam skills. IPC scores were computed as percent of items rated well done in each domain (Cronbach's alpha > 0.77). Analyses include item frequencies, comparison of mean domain scores, correlation between IPC and other skills, and content analysis of SN comments and resident training needs.; RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-eight residents (of 199 total) completed an IPC case and results are reported for the 162 who participated in our medical education research registry. IPC domain scores were: Roles/responsibilities mean = 37% well done (SD 37%); Values/ethics mean = 49% (SD 40%); Interprofessional communication mean = 27% (SD 36%); Teamwork mean = 47% (SD 29%). IPC was not significantly correlated with other core clinical skills. SNs' comments focused on respect and IPC as a distinct skill set. Residents described needs for greater clarification of roles and more workplace-based opportunities structured to support interprofessional education/learning.; CONCLUSIONS: The IPC cases and competence checklist are a practical method for conducting needs assessments and evaluating IPC training/curriculum that provides rich and actionable data at both the individual and program levels.

AB Biomedical big data, as a whole, covers numerous features, while each dataset specifically delineates part of them. "Full feature spectrum" knowledge discovery across heterogeneous data sources remains a major challenge. We developed a method called bootstrapping for unified feature association measurement (BUFAM) for pairwise association analysis, and relational dependency network (RDN) modeling for global module detection on features across breast cancer cohorts. Discovered knowledge was cross-validated using data from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's electronic medical records and annotated with BioCarta signaling signatures. The clinical potential of the discovered modules was exhibited by stratifying patients for drug responses. A series of discovered associations provided new insights into breast cancer, such as the effects of patient's cultural background on preferences for surgical procedure. We also discovered two groups of highly associated features, the HER2 and the ER modules, each of which described how phenotypes were associated with molecular signatures, diagnostic features, and clinical decisions. The discovered "ER module", which was dominated by cancer immunity, was used as an example for patient stratification and prediction of drug responses to tamoxifen and chemotherapy. BUFAM-derived RDN modeling demonstrated unique ability to discover clinically meaningful and actionable knowledge across highly heterogeneous biomedical big data sets.

AB PURPOSE: Insulin infusion sets (IISs) are an essential component of safe and effective insulin pump therapy. Establishing best practices for their use has been impeded by a lack of formal study and limited resources for clinician and patient education. Recent innovations in IIS science promise to change this status quo by increasing awareness of such problems as unexplained hyperglycemia and infusion set occlusion.; METHODS: In August 2015, a panel of diabetologists and certified diabetes educators from various disciplines was convened to reconsider IIS-related complications of pump therapy, to better characterize infusion set factors affecting patient experience, and to update priorities for optimizing current technologies. Actionable guidelines were provided for addressing common issues, including skin reactions, site rotation and set changes, dislodgment of the infusion set, and partial or complete blockage of the catheter. These issues may underlie episodes of IIS failure and/or unexplained hyperglycemia.; CONCLUSION: Development of practical tools and standardized guidelines for empowering patients to prevent, diagnose, and troubleshoot IIS problems that contribute to unexplained hyperglycemia will be necessary to realize the full benefit of insulin pump therapy along the continuum of diabetes education. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB OBJECTIVES: Checklists are being introduced to enhance patient safety, but the results have been mixed. The goal of this research is to understand why time-outs and checklists are sometimes not effective in preventing surgicaladverse events and to identify additional measures needed to reduce these events.; METHODS: A total of 380 consecutive patients underwent complex cardiac surgery over a 24-month period between November 2011 and November 2013 at an academic medical center, out of a total of 529 cardiac cases. Elective isolated aortic valve replacements, mitral valve repairs, and coronary artery bypass graft surgical procedures (N=149) were excluded. A time-out was conducted in a standard fashion in all patients in accordance with the World Health Organization surgical checklist protocol. Adverse events were classified as anything that resulted in an operative delay, nonavailability of equipment, failure of drug administration, or unexpected adverse clinical outcome. These events and their details were collected every week and analyzed using a systemic causal analysis technique using a technique called CAST (causal analysis based on systems theory). This analytic technique evaluated the sociotechnical system to identify the set of causal factors involved in the adverse events and the causal factors explored to identify reasons. Recommendations were made for the improvement of checklists and the use of system design changes that could prevent such events in the future.; RESULTS: Thirty events were identified. The causal analysis of these 30 adverse events was carried out and actionable events classified. There were important limitations in the use of standard checklists as a stand-alone patient safety measure in the operating room setting, because of multiple factors. Major categories included miscommunication between staff, medication errors, missing instrumentation, missing implants, and improper handling of equipment or instruments. An average of 3.9 recommendations were generated for each adverse event scenario.; CONCLUSIONS: Time-outs and checklists can prevent some types of adverse events,but they need to be carefully designed. Additional interventions aimedat improving safety controls in the system design are needed to augmentthe use of checklists. Customization of checklists for specialized surgicalprocedures may reduce adverse events. Copyright © 2016 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Genetic variation can affect drug response in multiple ways, although it remains unclear how rare genetic variants affect drug response. The electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, collaborating with the Pharmacogenomics Research Network, began eMERGE-PGx, a targeted sequencing study to assess genetic variation in 82 pharmacogenes critical for implementation of "precision medicine." The February 2015 eMERGE-PGx data release includes sequence-derived data from 5,000 clinical subjects. We present the variant frequency spectrum categorized by variant type, ancestry, and predicted function. We found 95.12% of genes have variants with a scaled Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion score above 20, and 96.19% of all samples had one or more Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Level A actionable variants. These data highlight the distribution and scope of genetic variation in relevant pharmacogenes, identifying challenges associated with implementing clinical sequencing for drug treatment at a broader level, underscoring the importance for multifaceted research in the execution of precision medicine. © 2016 The Authors.

AB Providers have expressed a strong desire to have additional clinical decision-support tools to help with interpretation of pharmacogenomic results. We developed and tested a novel disease-drug association tool that enables pharmacogenomic-based prescribing to treat common diseases. First, 324 drugs were mapped to 484 distinct diseases (mean number of drugs treating each disease was 4.9; range 1-37). Then the disease-drug association tool was pharmacogenomically annotated, with an average of 1.8 pharmacogenomically annotated drugs associated/disease. Applying this tool to a prospectively enrolled >1,000 patient cohort from a tertiary medical center showed that 90% of the top 20 diseases in this population and ≥93% of patients could appropriately be treated with ≥1 medication with actionable pharmacogenomic information. When combined with clinical patient genotypes, this tool permits delivery of patient-specific pharmacogenomically informed disease treatment recommendations to inform the treatment of many medical conditions of the US population, a key initial step towards implementation of precision medicine. © 2016 The American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the independent associations between actionable bleeding (AB) and coronary thrombotic events (CTE) on mortality risk after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).; BACKGROUND: The independent impact of AB and CTE on mortality risk after PCI remains poorly characterized.; METHODS: A post hoc analysis was conducted of the PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Dual Antiplatelet Therapy inStented Patients) registry, a real-world cohort of 5,018 patients undergoing PCI with stent implantation. CTE includeddefinite or probable stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction. AB was defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2 or 3. Associations between CTE and AB, both of which were modeled as time-dependent covariates, and 2-year mortality risk were examined using extended Cox regression.; RESULTS: Over 2 years, the cumulative incidence of CTE, AB, and all-cause mortality was 5.9% (n= 289), 8.1% (n=391), and 4.7% (n= 227), respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios for mortality associated with CTE and AB were 3.3 (95% confidence interval: 2.2 to 4.9) and 3.5 (95% confidence interval: 2.3 to 5.4), respectively. Temporal gradients in risk after either event were highest in the first 30 days and declined rapidly thereafter. Thrombotic events occurring while patients were on versus off dual-antiplatelet therapy were associated with a higher mortality risk, whereas risk related to AB was not influenced by dual-antiplatelet therapy status at the time of bleeding.; CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary thrombosis and AB are associated with mortality risks of comparable magnitude over a 2-year period after PCI, findings that might inform risk/benefit calculations for extension versus discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy.

AB Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Comprehensive tumor profiling was performed to understand clinically actionable alterations in IBC. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and IHC were performed to identify activated pathways in IBC tumor tissues. siRNA studies examined the impact of IBC genomic variants in cellular models. IBC tumor tissues were further characterized for immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression by IHC. Genomic analysis identified recurrent alterations in core biologic pathways, including activating and targetable variants in HER/PI3K/mTOR signaling. High rates of activating HER3 point mutations were discovered in IBC tumors. Cell line studies confirmed a role for mutant HER3 in IBC cell proliferation. Immunologic analysis revealed a subset of IBC tumors associated with high CD8(+)/PD-L1(+) lymphocyte infiltration. Immune infiltration positively correlated with an NGS-based estimate of neoantigen exposure derived from the somatic mutation rate and mutant allele frequency, iScore. Additionally, DNA mismatch repair alterations, which may contribute to higher iScores, occurred at greater frequency in tumors with higher immune infiltration. Our study identifies genomic alterations that mechanistically contribute to oncogenic signaling in IBC and provides a genetic basis for the selection of clinically relevant targeted and combination therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, an NGS-based estimate of neoantigen exposure developed in this study (iScore) may be a useful biomarker to predict immune infiltration in IBC and other cancers. The iScore may be associated with greater levels of response to immunotherapies, such as PD-L1/PD-1-targeted therapies.

AB Rapid advances in DNA sequencing, metabolomics, proteomics and computational tools are dramatically increasing access to the microbiome and identification of its links with disease. In particular, time-series studies and multiple molecular perspectives are facilitating microbiome-wide association studies, which are analogous to genome-wide association studies. Early findings point to actionable outcomes of microbiome-wide association studies, although their clinical application has yet to be approved. An appreciation of the complexity of interactions among the microbiome and the host's diet, chemistry and health, as well as determining the frequency of observations that are needed to capture and integrate this dynamic interface, is paramount for developing precision diagnostics and therapies that are based on the microbiome.

AB The discovery of actionable targets is crucial for targeted therapies and is also a constituent part of the drug discovery process. The success of an intervention over a target depends critically on its contribution, within the complex network of gene interactions, to the cellular processes responsible for disease progression or therapeutic response. Here we present PathAct, a web server that predicts the effect that interventions over genes (inhibitions or activations that simulate knock-outs, drug treatments or over-expressions) can have over signal transmission within signaling pathways and, ultimately, over the cell functionalities triggered by them. PathAct implements an advanced graphical interface that provides a unique interactive working environment in which the suitability of potentially actionable genes, that could eventually become drug targets for personalized or individualized therapies, can be easily tested. The PathAct tool can be found at: http://pathact.babelomics.org. © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.

AB In this methodological article, we examine participatory methods in depth to demonstrate how these methods can be adopted for quality improvement (QI) projects in health care. We draw on existing literature and our QI initiatives in the Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss the application of photovoice and guided tours in QI efforts. We highlight lessons learned and several benefits of using participatory methods in this area. Using participatory methods, evaluators can engage patients, providers, and other stakeholders as partners to enhance care. Participant involvement helps yield actionable data that can be translated into improved care practices. Use of these methods also helps generate key insights to inform improvements that truly resonate with stakeholders. Using participatory methods is a valuable strategy to harness participant engagement and drive improvements that address individual needs. In applying these innovative methodologies, evaluators can transcend traditional approaches to uniquely support evaluations and improvements in health care. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB BACKGROUND: Infant and young child feeding practices, including breastfeeding and complementary feeding of children under 2years old, are crucially influenced by parent and family perceptions and experiences. Given the urgent need to improve nutrition of young children in low- and low-middle-income countries, both for reduction of morbidity and mortality in childhood and for future health outcomes, we propose to systematically review and synthesize available qualitative data specifically related to infant and young child feeding practices of parents and families in these settings, which may provide greater insights into barriers and facilitators to recommended feeding practices.; METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study will systematically review existing qualitative research reporting infant and young child feeding practices from low- and low-middle-income settings. The Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement will be used for reporting the stages of the review and dissemination. The search period will include all studies published from 2006 to 2016. The study selection process will follow established and recommended guidelines for reviews, and quality assessment will be conducted in two phases using critical appraisal and subsequently a confidence in findings approach derived from Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative (GRADE-CERQual). A full synthesis of the studies identified by the review will begin with thematic analysis and be followed by an interpretive approach to provide actionable information on the topic.; DISCUSSION: The findings will provide insight into the barriers and facilitators related to behavior that may hinder or enable implementation of interventions aimed at improving infant and young child feeding practices in lower-income settings.; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42016035677.

AB The present study tested a model on the relationship between functional status of children with physical disability, caregiving-specific worry, affiliate stigma, and psychological distress among their caregivers. One hundred thirty-one caregivers of children with physical disability in Hong Kong completed a self-report questionnaire. Structural equation modeling showed that the final model had good fit to the data: chi2 = 102.05, (df = 83, p = .08), comparative fit index = .98, nonnormed fit index = .98, standardized root mean square residual = .08, root mean square error of approximation = .04. Caregivers whose children had a lower functional status reported more caregiving-specific worry. Affiliate stigma had significant and positive indirect effect on psychological distress through increasing worry. Results also supported the direct and indirect effects of perceived social support in ameliorating worry, affiliate stigma, and psychological distress. Findings suggested that health care and social service providers should consider the functional impairment of each child when designing stress reduction interventions for their caregivers. Findings implicate the importance of establishing barrier-free environment and public facilities in the society. Caregivers are encouraged to distinguish those worries that are actionable and convert them into problem solving plans and to actively engage in peer support and social activities to reduce their affiliate stigma. To truly promote inclusion and well-being of individuals with disability and their caregivers, the scope and targets of social services and stigma reduction programs by the government should include not only the persons with disabilities, but also their caregivers and family members who play essential roles in the rehabilitation journey.

AB Each July, new graduates from premedical, medical, and residency programs, along with junior and midcareer faculty, acclimatize to their changing roles. During this month, overall efficiency, quality, and patient safety may suffer, a problem dubbed the "July effect." The many transitions that occur in teaching hospitals during July are often implicated as the root cause of this problem. The question, then, of how best to improve the team-based clinical care provided in July remains important. In this Commentary, the authors outline a model that combines the team-based care paradigm with effective leadership, followership, and communication-based strategies and propose some actionable steps.A key first step to enhancing patient safety in July is improving effective leadership through use of a select group of attendings whose teaching style empowers learners within a framework of close supervision. Second, programmatic efforts to pair these leaders with good followers are needed. Senior residents in July should be selected on their ability to mentor, guide, and support interns. Third, a system of free-flowing, bidirectional communication must be nurtured to ensure optimal outcomes. Adapting strategies from the airlines (e.g., interdisciplinary conferences to discuss optimal patient care approaches; checklists for daily activities such as sign-outs; directed feedback and debriefing techniques emphasizing actionable areas for improvement) is promising and worth studying.Available data suggest that the "July effect" is real. Developing new and exploring existing approaches for allaying this phenomenon are important areas of further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is an actionable target in bladder cancer. Preclinical studies show that anti-FGFR3 treatment slows down tumor growth, suggesting that this tyrosine kinase receptor is a candidate for personalized bladder cancer treatment, particularly in patients with mutated FGFR3. We addressed tumor heterogeneity in a large multicenter, multi-laboratory study, as this may have significant impact on therapeutic response.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated possible FGFR3 heterogeneity by the PCR-SNaPshot method in the superficial and deep compartments of tumors obtained by transurethral resection (TUR, n = 61) and in radical cystectomy (RC, n = 614) specimens and corresponding cancer-positive lymph nodes (LN+, n = 201).; RESULTS: We found FGFR3 mutations in 13/34 (38%) T1 and 8/27 (30%) ≥T2-TUR samples, with 100% concordance between superficial and deeper parts in T1-TUR samples. Of eight FGFR3 mutant ≥T2-TUR samples, only 4 (50%) displayed the mutation in the deeper part. We found 67/614 (11%) FGFR3 mutations in RC specimens. FGFR3 mutation was associated with pN0 (P < 0.001) at RC. In 10/201 (5%) LN+, an FGFR3 mutation was found, all concordant with the corresponding RC specimen. In the remaining 191 cases, RC and LN+ were both wild type.; CONCLUSIONS: FGFR3 mutation status seems promising to guide decision-making on adjuvant anti-FGFR3 therapy as it appeared homogeneous in RC and LN+. Based on the results of TUR, the deep part of the tumor needs to be assessed if neoadjuvant anti-FGFR3 treatment is considered. We conclude that studies on the heterogeneity of actionable molecular targets should precede clinical trials with these drugs in the perioperative setting. © The Author 2016.

AB Innovative molecular diagnostics deployed in the clinic enable new ways to stratify patients into appropriate treatment regimens. These approaches may resolve a major challenge for early-phase clinical trials, which is to recruit patients who, while having failed previous treatments, may nevertheless respond to molecularly targeted drugs. We report the findings of a prospective, single-center study conducted in patients with diverse refractory cancers who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP; next-generation sequencing, 236 genes). Of the 500 patients enrolled, 188 (37.6%) received either matched (N = 122/188, 65%) or unmatched therapy (N = 66/188, 35%). The most common reasons that patients were not evaluable for treatment included insufficient tissue, death, or hospice transfer. The median number of molecular alterations per patient was five (range, 1-14); median number of prior therapies, four. The most common diagnoses were ovarian cancer (18%), breast cancer (16%), sarcoma (13%), and renal cancer (7%). Of the 339 successfully profiled patients, 317 (93.5%) had at least one potentially actionable alteration. By calculating matching scores, based on the number of drug matches and genomic aberrations per patient, we found that high scores were independently associated with a greater frequency of stable disease ≥6 months/partial/complete remission [22% (high scores) vs. 9% (low scores), P = 0.024], longer time-to-treatment failure [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.36-0.74; P = 0.0003], and survival (HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.43-1.0; P = 0.05). Collectively, this study offers a clinical proof of concept for the utility of CGP in assigning therapy to patients with refractory malignancies, especially in those patients with multiple genomic aberrations for whom combination therapies could be implemented.

AB PURPOSE: Scant research has been undertaken to explore in-depth the meaning of bodily change for individuals following stoma formation. The aim of this study was to understand the experience of living with a new stoma, with a focus on bodily change.; METHOD: The study adopted a longitudinal phenomenological approach. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit 12 participants who had undergone faecal stoma-forming surgery. In-depth, unstructured interviews were conducted at 3, 9 and 15 months following surgery. A five-stage framework facilitated iterative data analysis.; RESULTS: Stoma formation altered the taken-for-granted relationship individuals had with their bodies in terms of appearance, function and sensation, undermining the unity between body and self. Increasing familiarity with and perceived control over their stoma over time diminished awareness of their changed body, facilitating adaptation and self-acceptance.; CONCLUSIONS: Stoma formation can undermine an individual's sense of embodied self. A concept of embodiment is proposed to enable the experience of living with a new stoma to be understood as part of a wider process of re-establishing a unity between body, self and world. In defining a framework of care, individuals with a new stoma can be assisted to adapt to and accept a changed sense of embodied self. Implications for Rehabilitation Awareness and understanding of the diverse ways in which stoma formation disrupts the unconscious relationship between body and self can help clinicians to provide responsive, person-centred care. Supporting strategies that facilitate bodily mastery following stoma formation will facilitate rehabilitation and promote adjustment and self-acceptance. A concept of embodiment can help clinicians to deepen their understanding of the experiences of people living with a new stoma and the support they may require during the rehabilitation process. This paper provides clinicians with actionable insight that allows them to better support patients to a smoother adjustment process after stoma formation.

AB BACKGROUND: In 2013, Nigeria accounted for 15% of the 1.3 million pregnant women living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and 26% of new infections among children worldwide. Despite this, less than 20% of pregnant women in Nigeria received an HIV test during pregnancy, and only 23% of HIV-infected pregnant women received appropriate intervention following HIV diagnosis. This article reports findings from 2 structured group exercises conducted at the first Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance Conference to identify (1) barriers and research gaps related to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and (2) potential strategies and interventions that could address PMTCT challenges.; METHODS: Two 1-hour structured group exercises were conducted with 10 groups of 14-15 individuals (n = 145), who were asked to brainstorm barriers and strategies and to rank their top 3 in each category. Data analysis eliminated duplicate responses and categorized each of the priorities along the HIV care continuum: HIV diagnosis, linkage to care, or retention in care.; RESULTS: Participating stakeholders identified 20 unique barriers and research gaps related to PMTCT across the HIV continuum. Twenty-five unique interventions and implementation strategies were identified. Similar to the barriers and research gaps, these interventions and strategies were distributed across the HIV care continuum.; CONCLUSIONS: The barriers and strategies identified in this study represent important pathways to progress addressing MTCT. The deliberate involvement of state and federal policy makers, program implementers, and researchers helps ensure that they are relevant and actionable.

AB This three arm study was designed to make CRC screening with FOBTs more accessible, understandable and actionable for patients cared for in predominantly rural Federally Qualified Health Centers. Patients in an enhanced version of usual care received an annual CRC recommendation and FOBT kit; those in the education arm additionally received brief literacy and culturally appropriate education and those in the nurse arm received the education by a nurse manager who followed up by telephone. Baseline FOBT rates in this population were 3%. We evaluated if FOBT rates could be sustained over 3years. A three-arm, quasi-experimental evaluation was conducted among eight clinics in Louisiana. Screening efforts included: (1) enhanced usual care, (2) literacy-informed education of patients, and (3) education plus nurse support. Overall, 961 average-risk patients, ages 50-85, eligible for routine CRC screenings were recruited. The primary outcome was completing three annual FOBT tests. Of 961 patients enrolled, 381 (39.6%) participants did not complete a single FOBT, 60.4% completed at least one FOBT of which 318 (33.1%) completed only one, 162 (16.9%) completed two and 100 (10.4%) completed three FOBTs over the 3-year period (the primary study outcome). The primary outcome, return of three FOBT kits over the 3-year period, was achieved by 4.7% in enhanced care, 11.4% in education and 13.6% in the nurse arm (p=0.005). Overall 3-year FOBT screening rates were not sustained with any of the three interventions, despite reports of promising interim results at years 1 and 2. New strategies for sustaining FOBT screening over several years must be developed.

AB Genetic studies in late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) are aimed at identifying core disease mechanisms and providing potential biomarkers and drug candidates to improve clinical care of AD. However, owing to the complexity of LOAD, including pathological heterogeneity and disease polygenicity, extraction of actionable guidance from LOAD genetics has been challenging. Past attempts to summarize the effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants have used pathway analysis and collections of small-scale experiments to hypothesize functional convergence across several variants. In this Review, we discuss how the study of molecular, cellular and brain networks provides additional information on the effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants. We then discuss emerging combinations of these omic data sets into multiscale models, which provide a more comprehensive representation of the effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants at multiple biophysical scales. Furthermore, we highlight the clinical potential of mechanistically coupling genetic variants and disease phenotypes with multiscale brain models.

AB Cancer is often driven by the accumulation of genetic alterations, including single nucleotide variants, small insertions or deletions, gene fusions, copy-number variations, and large chromosomal rearrangements. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have helped investigators generate massive amounts of cancer genomic data and catalog somatic mutations in both common and rare cancer types. So far, the somatic mutation landscapes and signatures of >10 major cancer types have been reported; however, pinpointing driver mutations and cancer genes from millions of available cancer somatic mutations remains a monumental challenge. To tackle this important task, many methods and computational tools have been developed during the past several years and, thus, a review of its advances is urgently needed. Here, we first summarize the main features of these methods and tools for whole-exome, whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing data. Then, we discuss major challenges like tumor intra-heterogeneity, tumor sample saturation and functionality of synonymous mutations in cancer, all of which may result in false-positive discoveries. Finally, we highlight new directions in studying regulatory roles of noncoding somatic mutations and quantitatively measuring circulating tumor DNA in cancer. This review may help investigators find an appropriate tool for detecting potential driver or actionable mutations in rapidly emerging precision cancer medicine. © The Author 2015.

AB BACKGROUND: The most important reason for measuring HIV-1 viral load (VL) is to monitor the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART), both for the initial therapeutic response and sustained responses. Maintaining low or undetectable HIV-1 VL levels can reduce both the risks of progression to AIDS and transmission of infection to others.; OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert() HIV-1 Viral Load (VL) assay compared to the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay, including assessing specificity by testing plasma specimens from confirmed HIV-1 negative blood donors.; STUDY DESIGN: Subjects were enrolled from 4 participating sites, 2 in Europe and 2 in the USA. Fresh plasma samples were tested prospectively, while frozen plasma samples were collected prospectively, and tested retrospectively after selection of specimens to cover the assay's quantification range (40cp/mL-10,000,000 cp/mL). Eligibility criteria included a clinician ordered HIV-1 VL test from a confirmed HIV-1 positive adult (≥18 years) with a known antiviral treatment status. Exclusion criteria included previous enrollment in this study or improper specimen collection. Human blood donor specimens determined to be HIV-1 negative by standard blood bank antibody and nucleic acid amplification methods were used to assess specificity.; RESULTS: Of the 764 specimens collected, 752 were eligible for inclusion but 5 were not tested by the Xpert, leaving 747 specimens tested (28.2% from females and 71.8% from males). Valid results were obtained for 724/747 (96.9%) specimens tested using the Xpert HIV-1 VL assay. The Xpert HIV-1 VL assay detected or quantified 568/724 (78.5%) specimens, while the RealTime HIV-1 assay detected or quantified 559/724 (77.2%). Of the 724 specimens tested by both assays, 390 were quantified by both assays and showed strong correlation: r=0.9847, with an R(2)=0.9696. Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the two assays (381/390; 97.7%) with a distribution within 0.5 log10 cp/mL centered around zero. Xpert yielded VLs for 393 (80%) of the 494 quantifiable samples by Abbott. VLs of those specimens quantified by one of the assays, and either detected but not quantified or not detected by the other assay were all <170cp/mL. Specificity of the Xpert assay was found to be 100% (109/109), 95% CI: 96.7-100.0.; CONCLUSION: Very good correlation was seen between the Xpert HIV-1 VL and Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assays, with added benefits for Xpert HIV-1 VL of: (1) lot-to-lot consistency traceable to WHO International Standard, (2) requiring both high and low level internal controls to be in range to have a valid result, (3) use of a single HIV-1 target for PCR and (4) faster turn-around-time for results, no need to wait to do batch testing of specimens. In summary, Xpert HIV-1 VL generated accurate VL results that if implemented could allow for actionable and timely treatment decisions during the same clinic visit. This scenario could reduce the loss to follow up often seen when these test results take days to weeks to become available to the clinician and patient. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB OBJECTIVE: Currently, there is a disconnect between finding a patient's relevant molecular profile and predicting actionable therapeutics. Here we develop and implement the Integrating Molecular Profiles with Actionable Therapeutics (IMPACT) analysis pipeline, linking variants detected from whole-exome sequencing (WES) to actionable therapeutics.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: The IMPACT pipeline contains 4 analytical modules: detecting somatic variants, calling copy number alterations, predicting drugs against deleterious variants, and analyzing tumor heterogeneity. We tested the IMPACT pipeline on whole-exome sequencing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma samples with known EGFR mutations. We also used IMPACT to analyze melanoma patient tumor samples before treatment, after BRAF-inhibitor treatment, and after BRAF- and MEK-inhibitor treatment.; RESULTS: IMPACT Food and Drug Administration (FDA) correctly identified known EGFR mutations in the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma samples. IMPACT linked these EGFR mutations to the appropriate FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors. For the melanoma patient samples, we identified NRAS p.Q61K as an acquired resistance mutation to BRAF-inhibitor treatment. We also identified CDKN2A deletion as a novel acquired resistance mutation to BRAFi/MEKi inhibition. The IMPACT analysis pipeline predicts these somatic variants to actionable therapeutics. We observed the clonal dynamic in the tumor samples after various treatments. We showed that IMPACT not only helped in successful prioritization of clinically relevant variants but also linked these variations to possible targeted therapies.; CONCLUSION: IMPACT provides a new bioinformatics strategy to delineate candidate somatic variants and actionable therapies. This approach can be applied to other patient tumor samples to discover effective drug targets for personalized medicine.IMPACT is publicly available at http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/IMPACT. © The Author 2016.

AB The Information Systems Department at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center developed the DARWIN Cohort Management System (DCMS). The DCMS identifies and tracks cohorts of patients based on genotypic and clinical data. It assists researchers and treating physicians in enrolling patients to genotype-matched IRB-approved clinical trials. The DCMS sends automated, actionable, and secure email notifications to users with information about eligible or enrolled patients before their upcoming appointments. The system also captures investigators input via annotations on patient eligibility and preferences on future status updates. As of August 2015, the DCMS is tracking 159,893 patients on both clinical operations and research cohorts. 134 research cohorts have been established and track 64,473 patients. 51,192 of these have had one or more genomic tests including MSK-IMPACT, comprising the pool eligible for genotype-matched studies.

AB BACKGROUND: "Precision medicine" (PM) requires researchers to identify actionable genetic risks and for clinicians to interpret genetic testing results to patients. Whether PM will equally benefit all populations or exacerbate existing disparities is uncertain.; METHODS: We ascertained attitudes toward genetic testing and genetic research by race in the United States using the online Amazon mTurk US workforce (n=403 White; n=56 African American (AA)). Generalized linear models were used to test differences in beliefs and preferences by race, adjusting for sociodemographics and prior genetic experience.; RESULTS: AA were less likely than White to believe that genetic tests should be promoted or made available. Further, AA were less likely to want genetic testing results or to participate in genetic research.; CONCLUSIONS: Important dimensions that underlay PM are not universally accepted by all populations.

AB MYC oncoproteins are involved in the genesis and maintenance of the majority of human tumors but are considered undruggable. By using a direct in vivo shRNA screen, we show that liver cancer cells that have mutations in the gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) and that are driven by the oncoprotein NRAS become addicted to MYC stabilization via a mechanism mediated by aurora kinase A (AURKA). This MYC stabilization enables the tumor cells to overcome a latent G2/M cell cycle arrest that is mediated by AURKA and the tumor suppressor protein p19(ARF). MYC directly binds to AURKA, and inhibition of this protein-protein interaction by conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors results in subsequent MYC degradation and cell death. These conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, with one of them currently being tested in early clinical trials, suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing Trp53-deficient, NRAS-driven MYC-expressing hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). TP53-mutated human HCCs revealed increased AURKA expression and a positive correlation between AURKA and MYC expression. In xenograft models, mice bearing TP53-mutated or TP53-deleted human HCCs were hypersensitive to treatment with conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, thus suggesting a therapeutic strategy for this subgroup of human HCCs.

AB BACKGROUND: The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, and there have been calls for adopting a multi-sectoral approach in developing policies and programs to address this burden. Evidence exists largely from high-income countries on the success (and lack thereof) of multi-sectoral approach in improving population level health outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is limited research on the application and success of multi-sectoral approach in the formulation and implementation of policies aimed at prevention of non-communicable diseases. Therefore, this protocol describes a study that aims to primarily generate evidence on the extent to which multi-sectoral approach has been applied in developing policies to prevent non-communicable disease in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa -Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo and South Africa.; METHODS/DESIGN: The study applies a multiple case study design. Data will be collated mainly through document reviews and key informant interviews with the relevant decision makers in various sectors. In each country, a detailed case study analysis will be undertaken of any policy/policies developed, adopted and implemented, aimed at implementing the World Health Organization recommended "best buys" for non-communicable disease prevention. These case studies will be conducted by research teams in each country; each team includes a senior research fellow supported by a doctoral student, and research assistants.; DISCUSSION: Uptake of the evidence generated from the case studies will be ensured by systematic engagement with policy makers in each country throughout the research process. Ultimately, a forum of experts will be convened to generate actionable recommendations on the use of multi-sectoral approach in non-communicable disease prevention policies in the region.

AB Lung cancer remains one of the most complex and challenging cancers, being responsible for almost a third of all cancer deaths. This grim picture seems however to be changing, for at least a subset of lung cancers. The number of patients who can benefit from targeted therapies is steadily increasing thanks to the progress made in identifying actionable driver lesions in lung tumours. The success of the latest generation of EGFR and ALK inhibitors in the clinic not only illustrates the value of targeted therapies, but also shows how almost inevitably drug resistance develops. Therefore, more sophisticated approaches are needed to achieve long-term remissions. Although there are still significant barriers to be overcome, technological advances in early detection of relevant mutations and the opportunity to test new drugs in predictive preclinical models justify the hope that we will overcome these obstacles.

AB Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) represent one of the most frequent "actionable" alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Typified by high response rates to targeted therapies, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now established first-line treatment options and have transformed the treatment paradigm for NSCLC. With the recent breakthrough designation and approval of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib, available systemic and local treatment options have expanded, requiring new clinical algorithms that take into account individual patient molecular and clinical profiles. In this International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer commissioned consensus statement, key pathologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations, such as optimal choice of EGFR TKI and management of brain metastasis, are discussed. In addition, recommendations are made for clinical guidelines and research priorities, such as the role of repeat biopsies and use of circulating free DNA for molecularstudies. With the rapid pace of progress in treating EGFR-mutant NSCLC, this statement provides a state-of-the-art review of the contemporary issues in managing this unique subgroup of patients.

AB Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the orbit and ocular adnexa is the most common primary orbital malignancy. Treatments for low- (extra-nodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas) and high-grade (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) are associated with local and vision-threatening toxicities. High-grade lymphomas relapse frequently and exhibit poor survival rates. Despite advances in genomic profiling and precision medicine, orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas remain poorly characterized molecularly. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas obtained from a single-center using a panel targeting near-term, clinically relevant genes. Potentially actionable mutations and copy number alterations were prioritized based on gain- and loss-of-function analyses, and catalogued, approved, and investigational therapies. Of 36 informative samples, including marginal zone lymphomas (n=20), follicular lymphomas (n=9), and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=7), 53% harbored a prioritized alteration (median=1, range 0-5/sample). MYD88 was the most frequently altered gene in our cohort, with potentially clinically relevant hotspot gain-of-function mutations identified in 71% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 25% of marginal zone lymphomas. Prioritized alterations in epigenetic modulators were common and included gain-of-function EZH2 and loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (14% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 22% of follicular lymphomas contained alterations in each of these two genes). Single prioritized alterations were also identified in the histone methyltransferases KMT2B (follicular lymphoma) and KMT3B (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Loss-of-function mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma), CDKN2A (diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphoma), PTEN (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), ATM (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and NF1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and gain-of-function mutations in the oncogenes HRAS (follicular lymphoma) and NRAS (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were also observed. Together, our study demonstrates that NGS can be used to profile routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas for identification of somatic-driving alterations and nomination of potential therapeutic strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric oncologists have begun to leverage tumor genetic profiling to match patients with targeted therapies. At the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), we developed the Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board (PMTB) to track, integrate, and interpret clinical genomic profiling and potential targeted therapeutic recommendations.; PROCEDURE: This retrospective case series includes all patients reviewed by the MSKCC PMTB from July 2014 to June 2015. Cases were submitted by treating oncologists and potential treatment recommendations were based upon the modified guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.; RESULTS: There were 41 presentations of 39 individual patients during the study period. Gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and neuroblastoma were the most commonly reviewed cases. Thirty nine (87%) of the 45 molecular sequencing profiles utilized hybrid-capture targeted genome sequencing. In 30 (73%) of the 41 presentations, the PMTB provided therapeutic recommendations, of which 19 (46%) were implemented. Twenty-one (70%) of the recommendations involved targeted therapies. Three (14%) targeted therapy recommendations had published evidence to support the proposed recommendations (evidence levels 1-2), eight (36%) recommendations had preclinical evidence (level 3), and 11 (50%) recommendations were based upon hypothetical biological rationales (level 4).; CONCLUSIONS: The MSKCC PMTB enabled a clinically relevant interpretation of genomic profiling. Effective use of clinical genomics is anticipated to require new and improved tools to ascribe pathogenic significance and therapeutic actionability. The development of specific rule-driven clinical protocols will be needed for the incorporation and evaluation of genomic and molecular profiling in interventional prospective clinical trials. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The post-genomic era has resulted in the accumulation of high-throughput cancer data from a vast array of genomic technologies including next-generation sequencing and microarray. As such, the large amounts of germline variant and somatic mutation data that have been generated from GWAS and sequencing projects, respectively, show great promise in providing a systems-level view of these genetic aberrations. In this study, we analyze publicly available GWAS, somatic mutation, and drug target data derived from large databanks using a network-based approach that incorporates directed edge information under a randomized network hypothesis testing procedure. We show that these three classes of disease-associated nodes exhibit non-random topological characteristics in the context of a functional interactome. Specifically, we show that drug targets tend to lie upstream of somatic mutations and disease susceptibility germline variants. In addition, we introduce a new approach to measuring hierarchy between drug targets, somatic mutants, and disease susceptibility genes by utilizing directionality and path length information. Overall, our results provide new insight into the intrinsic relationships between these node classes that broaden our understanding of cancer. In addition, our results align with current knowledge on the therapeutic actionability of GWAS and somatic mutant nodes, while demonstrating relationships between node classes from a global network perspective.

AB In the summer of 2015, the International Medical Informatics Association Nursing Informatics Special Interest Group (IMIA NISIG) Student Working Group developed and distributed an international survey of current and future trends in nursing informatics. The survey was developed based on current literature on nursing informatics trends and translated into six languages. Respondents were from 31 different countries in Asia, Africa, North and Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia. This paper presents the results of responses to the survey question: "What should be done (at a country or organizational level) to advance nursing informatics in the next 5-10 years?" (n responders = 272). Using thematic qualitative analysis, responses were grouped into five key themes: 1) Education and training; 2) Research; 3) Practice; 4) Visibility; and 5) Collaboration and integration. We also provide actionable recommendations for advancing nursing informatics in the next decade.

AB In this commentary, we discuss smartphone apps for psychiatry and the lack of resources to assist clinicians in evaluating the utility, safety, and efficacy of apps. Evaluating an app requires new considerations that are beyond those employed in evaluating a medication or typical clinical intervention. Based on our software engineering, informatics, and clinical knowledge and experiences, we propose an evaluation framework, "ASPECTS," to spark discussion about apps and aid clinicians in determining whether an app is Actionable, Secure, Professional, Evidence-based, Customizable, and TranSparent. Clinicians who use the ASPECTS guide will be more informed and able to make more thorough evaluations of apps. © Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Activating mutations in Galphaq proteins, which form the alpha subunit of certain heterotrimeric G proteins, drive uveal melanoma oncogenesis by triggering multiple downstream signaling pathways, including PLC/PKC, Rho/Rac, and YAP. Here we show that the small GTPase ARF6 acts as a proximal node of oncogenic Galphaq signaling to induce all of these downstream pathways as well as beta-catenin signaling. ARF6 activates these diverse pathways through a common mechanism: the trafficking of GNAQ and beta-catenin from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic vesicles and the nucleus, respectively. Blocking ARF6 with a small-molecule inhibitor reduces uveal melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a mouse model, confirming the functional relevance of this pathway and suggesting a therapeutic strategy for Galpha-mediated diseases.

AB PURPOSE: Liquid biopsies based on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis are described as surrogate samples for molecular analysis. We evaluated the concordance between tumor DNA (tDNA) and cfDNA analysis on a large cohort of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor, eligible for phase I trial and with good performance status, enrolled in MOSCATO 01 trial (clinical trial NCT01566019).; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Blood samples were collected at inclusion and cfDNA was extracted from plasma for 334 patients. Hotspot mutations were screened using next-generation sequencing for 50 cancer genes.; RESULTS: Among the 283 patients with tDNA-cfDNA pairs, 121 had mutation in both, 99 in tumor only, 5 in cfDNA only, and for 58 patients no mutation was detected, leading to a 55.0% estimated sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI), 48.4%-61.6%] at the patient level. Among the 220 patients with mutations in tDNA, the sensitivity of cfDNA analysis was significantly linked to the number of metastatic sites, albumin level, tumor type, and number of lines of treatment. A sensitivity prediction score could be derived from clinical parameters. Sensitivity is 83% in patients with a high score (≥8). In addition, we analyzed cfDNA for 51 patients without available tissue sample. Mutations were detected for 22 patients, including 19 oncogenic variants and 8 actionable mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Detection of somatic mutations in cfDNA is feasible for prescreening phase I candidates with a satisfactory specificity; overall sensitivity can be improved by a sensitivity score allowing to select patients for whom cfDNA constitutes a reliable noninvasive surrogate to screen mutations.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Ovarian cancer is an uncommon but deadly disease. There is no effective screening for the disease, and the majority of women with ovarian cancer present in advanced stage and eventually die from their disease. The majority of families with multiple cases of breast and ovarian cancer are found to carry germline mutations in BRCA1/2. Recent, more sensitive sequencing techniques have shown that nearly 20% of ovarian cancer is associated with germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes, with approximately 15% accounted for by deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2. Women found to have mutations in BRCA1/2 can be empowered to make decisions on reproduction, cancer prevention, or treatment that may either avoid cancer or prolong survival. Though initial studies suggested that African American (AA) women were significantly less likely than White women to have mutations in BRCA1/2, this has been found to be untrue. Despite this revelation, and the clear importance of BRCA1/2 mutation status to appropriate clinical management, AA women still undergo genetic counseling and testing at much lower rates than do comparable White women. This disparity is not explained by factors such as calculated risk of a mutation, insurance coverage, or previous knowledge of the availability of testing. To date, no effective strategies have been identified that can overcome this disparity. Possible approaches include use of patient navigators, online social media, or EMR-based decision support aids. Funders should support research in this area, as it represents an actionable means to decrease the burden of ovarian and breast cancer in AA women.

AB INTRODUCTION: Advances in the biology of non-small-cell lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, reveal multiple molecular subtypes driving oncogenesis. Accordingly, individualized targeted therapeutics are based on mutational diagnostics.; AREAS COVERED: Advances in strategies and techniques for individualized treatment, particularly of adenocarcinoma, are described through literature review. Approved therapies are established for some molecular subsets, with new driver mutations emerging that represent increasing proportions of patients. Actionable mutations are de novo oncogenic drivers or acquired resistance mediators, and mutational profiling is important for directing therapy. Patients should be monitored for emerging actionable resistance mutations. Liquid biopsy and associated multiplex diagnostics will be important means to monitor patients during treatment. Expert commentary: Outcomes with targeted agents may be improved by integrating mutation screens during treatment to optimize subsequent therapy. In order for this to be translated into impactful patient benefit, appropriate platforms and strategies need to be optimized and then implemented universally.

AB BACKGROUND: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at preventing HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), but there is uncertainty about how to identify high-risk MSM who should receive PrEP.; METHODS: We used a mathematical model to assess the cost-effectiveness of using the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM (HIRI-MSM) questionnaire to target PrEP to high-risk MSM. We simulated strategies of no PrEP, PrEP available to all MSM, and eligibility thresholds set to HIRI-MSM scores between 5 and 45, in increments of 5 (where a higher score predicts greater HIV risk). Based on the iPrEx, IPERGAY, and PROUD trials, we evaluated PrEP efficacies from 44% to 86% and annual costs from $5900 to 8700. We designate strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ≤$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) as "cost-effective."; RESULTS: Over 20 years, making PrEP available to all MSM is projected to prevent 33.5% of new HIV infections, with an ICER of $1,474,000/QALY. Increasing the HIRI-MSM score threshold reduces the prevented infections, but improves cost-effectiveness. A threshold score of 25 is projected to be optimal (most QALYs gained while still being cost-effective) over a wide range of realistic PrEP efficacies and costs. At low cost and high efficacy (IPERGAY), thresholds of 15 or 20 are optimal across a range of other input assumptions; at high cost and low efficacy (iPrEx), 25 or 30 are generally optimal.; CONCLUSIONS: The HIRI-MSM provides a clinically actionable means of guiding PrEP use. Using a score of 25 to determine PrEP eligibility could facilitate cost-effective use of PrEP among high-risk MSM who will benefit from it most.

AB Epidemics of communicable diseases place a huge burden on public health infrastructures across the world. Producing accurate and actionable forecasts of infectious disease incidence at short and long time scales will improve public health response to outbreaks. However, scientists and public health officials face many obstacles in trying to create such real-time forecasts of infectious disease incidence. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that annually infects over 400 million people worldwide. We developed a real-time forecasting model for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 77 provinces of Thailand. We created a practical computational infrastructure that generated multi-step predictions of dengue incidence in Thai provinces every two weeks throughout 2014. These predictions show mixed performance across provinces, out-performing seasonal baseline models in over half of provinces at a 1.5 month horizon. Additionally, to assess the degree to which delays in case reporting make long-range prediction a challenging task, we compared the performance of our real-time predictions with predictions made with fully reported data. This paper provides valuable lessons for the implementation of real-time predictions in the context of public health decision making.

AB Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and the absence of HER2 overexpression. These cancers represent a heterogeneous breast cancer subtype with a poor prognosis. Few systemic treatment options exist besides the use of chemotherapy (CT). The heterogeneity of the disease has limited the successful development of targeted therapy in unselected patient populations. Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for TNBC. However, intense research is ongoing to identify specific targets and develop additional and better systemic treatment options. Standard adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens include anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes. Platinum-based CT has been proposed as another CT option of interest in TNBC. We review the role of this therapy in general, and particularly in patients carrying BRCA germ-line mutations. Available data concerning the role of platinum-based CT in TNBC were acquired primarily in the neoadjuvant setting. The routine use of platinum-based CT is not yet recommended by available guidelines. Many studies have reported the molecular characterization of TNBCs. Several actionable targets have been identified. Novel therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical trials based on promising results observed in preclinical studies. These targets include androgen receptor, EGFR, PARP, FGFR, and the angiogenic pathway. We review the recent data on experimental drugs in this field. We also discuss the recent data concerning immunologic checkpoint inhibitors.

AB BACKGROUND: Predictive modeling is fundamental to transforming large clinical data sets, or "big clinical data," into actionable knowledge for various healthcare applications. Machine learning is a major predictive modeling approach, but two barriers make its use in healthcare challenging. First, a machine learning tool user must choose an algorithm and assign one or more model parameters called hyper-parameters before model training. The algorithm and hyper-parameter values used typically impact model accuracy by over 40%, but their selection requires many labor-intensive manual iterations that can be difficult even for computer scientists. Second, many clinical attributes are repeatedly recorded over time, requiring temporal aggregation before predictive modeling can be performed. Many labor-intensive manual iterations are required to identify a good pair of aggregation period and operator for each clinical attribute. Both barriers result in time and human resource bottlenecks, and preclude healthcare administrators and researchers from asking a series of what-if questions when probing opportunities to use predictive models to improve outcomes and reduce costs.; METHODS: This paper describes our design of and vision for PredicT-ML (prediction tool using machine learning), a software system that aims to overcome these barriers and automate machine learning model building with big clinical data.; RESULTS: The paper presents the detailed design of PredicT-ML.; CONCLUSIONS: PredicT-ML will open the use of big clinical data to thousands of healthcare administrators and researchers and increase the ability to advance clinical research and improve healthcare.

AB PURPOSE: Tumor screening for Lynch syndrome is recommended in all or most patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In metastatic CRC, sequencing of RAS/BRAF is necessary to guide clinical management. We hypothesized that a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that identifies RAS/BRAF and other actionable mutations could also reliably identify tumors with DNA mismatch repair protein deficiency (MMR-D) on the basis of increased mutational load.; METHODS: We identified all CRCs that underwent genomic mutation profiling with a custom NGS assay (MSK-IMPACT) between March 2014 and July 2015. Tumor mutational load, with exclusion of copy number changes, was determined for each case and compared with MMR status as determined by routine immunohistochemistry.; RESULTS: Tumors from 224 patients with unique CRC analyzed for MMR status also underwent MSK-IMPACT. Thirteen percent (n = 28) exhibited MMR-D by immunohistochemistry. Using the 341-gene assay, 100% of the 193 tumors with < 20 mutations were MMR-proficient. Of 31 tumors with ≥ 20 mutations, 28 (90%) were MMR-D. The three remaining tumors were easily identified as being distinct from the MMR-D tumors with > 150 mutations each. Each of these tumors harbored the P286R hotspot POLE mutation consistent with the ultramutator phenotype. Among MMR-D tumors, the median number of mutations was 50 (range, 20 to 90) compared with six (range, 0 to 17) in MMR-proficient/POLE wild-type tumors (P < .001). With a mutational load cutoff of ≥ 20 and < 150 for MMR-D detection, sensitivity and specificity were both 1.0 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.0).; CONCLUSION: A cutoff for mutational load can be identified via multigene NGS tumor profiling, which provides a highly accurate means of screening for MMR-D in the same assay that is used for tumor genotyping. © 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB Hepatic cytochrome P450 levels are down-regulated during inflammatory disease states, which can cause changes in downstream drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity. Long-term, we seek sufficient new insight into P450-regulating mechanisms to correctly anticipate how an individual's P450 expressions will respond when health and/or therapeutic interventions change. To date, improving explanatory mechanistic insight relies on knowledge gleaned from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experiments augmented by case reports. We are working to improve that reality by developing means to undertake scientifically useful virtual experiments. So doing requires translating an accepted theory of immune system influence on P450 regulation into a computational model, and then challenging the model via in silico experiments. We build upon two existing agent-based models-an in silico hepatocyte culture and an in silico liver-capable of exploring and challenging concrete mechanistic hypotheses. We instantiate an in silico version of this hypothesis: in response to lipopolysaccharide, Kupffer cells down-regulate hepatic P450 levels via inflammatory cytokines, thus leading to a reduction in metabolic capacity. We achieve multiple in vitro and in vivo validation targets gathered from five wet-lab experiments, including a lipopolysaccharide-cytokine dose-response curve, time-course P450 down-regulation, and changes in several different measures of drug clearance spanning three drugs: acetaminophen, antipyrine, and chlorzoxazone. Along the way to achieving validation targets, various aspects of each model are falsified and subsequently refined. This iterative process of falsification-refinement-validation leads to biomimetic yet parsimonious mechanisms, which can provide explanatory insight into how, where, and when various features are generated. We argue that as models such as these are incrementally improved through multiple rounds of mechanistic falsification and validation, we will generate virtual systems that embody deeper credible, actionable, explanatory insight into immune system-drug metabolism interactions within individuals.

AB Brain metastasis is a serious complication of cancer that causes significant morbidity for patients. Over the last decade, numerous new driver somatic mutations have been recognized and targeted therapies are changing the landscape of treatment in lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, which are also the three most common cancers that result in brain metastases. The common actionable mutations include the EGFR mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations in non-small cell lung cancer, the HER2 mutation in breast cancer, and the BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, most of the early trials with targeted agents excluded patients with brain metastases. With a better understanding of the biology, several recent trials of targeted therapy that focus on brain metastases have been reported and others are ongoing. Novel agents with better penetration across the blood-brain barrier are currently being investigated for patients with brain metastases. In this review, we discuss the current state of use and future directions of targeted therapies in brain metastases.

AB Most physicians believe they practiced personalized medicine prior to the genomics era that followed the sequencing of the human genome. The focus of personalized medicine has been primarily genomic medicine, wherein it is hoped that the nucleotide dissimilarities among different individuals would provide clinicians with more precise understanding of physiology, more refined diagnoses, better disease risk assessment, earlier detection and monitoring, and tailored treatments to the individual patient. However, to date, the "genomic bench" has not worked itself to the clinical thrombosis bedside. In fact, traditional plasma-based hemostasis-thrombosis laboratory testing, by assessing functional pathways of coagulation, may better help manage venous thrombotic disease than a single DNA variant with a small effect size. There are some new and exciting discoveries in the genetics of platelet reactivity pertaining to atherothrombotic disease. Despite a plethora of genetic/genomic data on platelet reactivity, there are relatively little actionable pharmacogenetic data with antiplatelet agents. Nevertheless, it is crucial for genome-wide DNA/RNA sequencing to continue in research settings for causal gene discovery, pharmacogenetic purposes, and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. The potential of genomics to advance medicine will require integration of personal data that are obtained in the patient history: environmental exposures, diet, social data, etc. Furthermore, without the ritual of obtaining this information, we will have depersonalized medicine, which lacks the precision needed for the research required to eventually incorporate genomics into routine, optimal, and value-added clinical care. © 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB The adaptor protein MYD88 is critical for relaying activation of Toll-like receptor signaling to NF-kappaB activation. MYD88 mutations, particularly the p.L265P mutation, have been described in numerous distinct B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Twenty-nine percent of activated B-cell-type DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL), which is characterized by constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, carry the p.L265P mutation. In addition, ABC-DLBCL frequently displays focal copy number gains affecting BCL2 Here, we generated a novel mouse model in which Cre-mediated recombination, specifically in B cells, leads to the conditional expression of Myd88(p.L252P) (the orthologous position of the human MYD88(p.L265P) mutation) from the endogenous locus. These mice develop a lymphoproliferative disease and occasional transformation into clonal lymphomas. The clonal disease displays the morphologic and immunophenotypical characteristics of ABC-DLBCL. Lymphomagenesis can be accelerated by crossing in a further novel allele, which mediates conditional overexpression of BCL2 Cross-validation experiments in human DLBCL samples revealed that both MYD88 and CD79B mutations are substantially enriched in ABC-DLBCL compared with germinal center B-cell DLBCL. Furthermore, analyses of human DLBCL genome sequencing data confirmed that BCL2 amplifications frequently co-occurred with MYD88 mutations, further validating our approach. Finally, in silico experiments revealed that MYD88-mutant ABC-DLBCL cells in particular display an actionable addiction to BCL2. Altogether, we generated a novel autochthonous mouse model of ABC-DLBCL that could be used as a preclinical platform for the development and validation of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ABC-DLBCL.

AB BACKGROUND: Intratumoral heterogeneity presents a major obstacle to the widespread implementation of precision medicine. The authors assessed the origin of intratumoral heterogeneity in nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis (NSGCT) and identified distinct tumor subtypes and a potentially lethal phenotype.; METHODS: In this retrospective study, all consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with an NSGCT between January 2000 and December 2010 were evaluated. The histologic makeup of primary tumors and the clinical course of disease were determined for each patient. A Fine and Gray proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic risk factors, and the Gray test was used to detect differences in the cumulative incidence of cancer death. In a separate prospective study, next-generation sequencing was performed on tumor samples from 9 patients to identify any actionable mutations.; RESULTS: Six hundred fifteen patients were included in this study. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of yolk sac tumor in the primary tumor (P=.0003) was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. NSGCT could be divided into 5 subgroups. Patients in the yolk sac-seminoma subgroup had the poorest clinical outcome (P=.0015). These tumors tended to undergo somatic transformation (P<.0001). Among the 9 NSGCTs that had a yolk sac tumor phenotype, no consistent gene mutation was detected.; CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggest that intratumoral heterogeneity is caused in part by differentiation of pluripotent progenitor cells. Integrated or multimodal therapy may be effective at addressing intratumoral heterogeneity and treating distinct subtypes as well as a potentially lethal phenotype of NSGCT.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Aggressive transformation, a frequent event in the natural history of follicular lymphoma, is associated with increased lymphoma-related mortality and yet the underlying biology remains poorly defined. This review outlines recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis and evolutionary process leading to transformation.; RECENT FINDINGS: Both the antecedent indolent and transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL) arise through branched divergent evolution with tumors emerging from a founder precursor population, the common progenitor cell. Although the majority of tFLs maintain a germinal center B-cell gene expression signature, an activated B-cell-type (ABC-type) profile appears to predominate in BCL2-translocation negative cases. It does not appear that a single unifying genetic or epigenetic event promotes a fitter and more aggressive clone.; SUMMARY: Transformed follicular tumors are genetically heterogeneous perhaps reflecting the varying clinical behavior and outcomes of this disease event. Follicular lymphoma and tFL remain incurable tumors highlighted by our inability to eradicate the founder common progenitor cell population with current therapies. Progress has now been made in defining the genetic events and evolutionary pathways responsible for transformation. Although more research is required in predicting and understanding the biology of transformation, there are opportunities to improve outcomes by preferentially directing targeted therapies toward 'actionable' early and transformation-specific aberrations.

AB Our objective was to define and propose a standardized magnetic resonance (MR) imaging structured report in patients with infertility to have clinical completeness on possible diagnosis and severity. Patients should be studied preferable on 3T equipment with a surface coil. Standard MR protocol should include high-resolution fast spin-echo T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted images and gradient-echo T1-weighted fat suppression images. The report should include ovaries (polycystic, endometrioma, tumor), oviduct (hydrosalpinx, hematosalpinx, pyosalpinx, peritubal anomalies), uterus (agenesia, hypoplasia, unicornuate, uterus didelphys, bicornuate, septate uterus), myometrium (leiomyomas, adenomyosis), endometrium (polyps, synechia, atrophy, neoplasia), cervix and vagina (isthmoceles, mucosal-parietal irregularity, stenosis, neoplasia), peritoneum (deep endometriosis), and urinary system-associated abnormalities. To be clinically useful, radiology reports must be structured, use standardized terminology, and convey actionable information. The structured report must comprise complete, comprehensive, and accurate information, allowing radiologists to continuously interact with patients and referring physicians to confirm that the information is used properly to affect the decision making process.

AB BACKGROUND: Personalized therapy provides the best outcome of cancer care and its implementation in the clinic has been greatly facilitated by recent convergence of enormous progress in basic cancer research, rapid advancement of new tumor profiling technologies, and an expanding compendium of targeted cancer therapeutics.; METHODS: We developed a personalized cancer therapy (PCT) program in a clinical setting, using an integrative genomics approach to fully characterize the complexity of each tumor. We carried out whole exome sequencing (WES) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping on DNA from tumor and patient-matched normal specimens, as well as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on available frozen specimens, to identify somatic (tumor-specific) mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), gene expression changes, gene fusions, and also germline variants. To provide high sensitivity in known cancer mutation hotspots, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2) was also employed. We integrated the resulting data with cancer knowledge bases and developed a specific workflow for each cancer type to improve interpretation of genomic data.; RESULTS: We returned genomics findings to 46 patients and their physicians describing somatic alterations and predicting drug response, toxicity, and prognosis. Mean 17.3 cancer-relevant somatic mutations per patient were identified, 13.3-fold, 6.9-fold, and 4.7-fold more than could have been detected using CHPv2, Oncomine Cancer Panel (OCP), and FoundationOne, respectively. Our approach delineated the underlying genetic drivers at the pathway level and provided meaningful predictions of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Actionable alterations were found in 91% of patients (mean 4.9 per patient, including somatic mutations, copy number alterations, gene expression alterations, and germline variants), a 7.5-fold, 2.0-fold, and 1.9-fold increase over what could have been uncovered by CHPv2, OCP, and FoundationOne, respectively. The findings altered the course of treatment in four cases.; CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a comprehensive, integrative genomic approach as outlined above significantly enhanced genomics-based PCT strategies.

AB PURPOSE: Currently, cardiac implantable electronic devices allow remote monitoring (RM) based on periodic (Boston Latitude [LAT], Medtronic Carelink [MCL], St. Jude Merlin [SJM]) or daily transmissions (Biotronik Home Monitoring [BHM]). The aim of this study was to compare all the current RM systems in normal practice and investigate the effect of periodicity of RM transmissions on early detection of clinical and device-related events.; METHODS: Two hundred eleven ICD patients (mean age 69±11 years, 158 males), were remotely followed up for 1 year (61 with BHM, 49 with LAT, 65 with MCL, 36 with SJM). Remote follow-ups were configured quarterly, except for the BHM (daily transmissions).; RESULTS: The event-free rates were 49% with BHM, 57% with LAT, 57% with MCL, and 58 % with SJM (long-rank, p=0.23). BHM generated 304 (interquartile range, 184-342) transmissions per patient in a year, LAT 9 (8-11), MCL 7 (5-10), and SJM 8 (7-14) (p<0.000001). Eighty actionable events occurred at 1 year follow-up, 69 (86%) with RM systems: BHM was associated with a higher cumulative rate of actionable events. At a multivariate analysis, daily transmissions were independently associated with an increased probability of event detection as compared to periodic transmission systems. The chance of event detection is reduced by 20% (p=0.036) for a 1-month increase of the between-transmission interval (27 % for actionable events, p=0.004).; CONCLUSIONS: Although all RM systems effectively detected major events, daily transmission was associated with a higher probability of early event detection.

AB Epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (EITL, also known as type II enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma) is an aggressive intestinal disease with poor prognosis and its molecular alterations have not been comprehensively characterized. We aimed to identify actionable easy-to-screen alterations that would allow better diagnostics and/or treatment of this deadly disease. By performing whole-exome sequencing of four EITL tumor-normal pairs, followed by amplicon deep sequencing of 42 tumor samples, frequent alterations of the JAK-STAT and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways were discovered in a large portion of samples. Specifically, STAT5B was mutated in a remarkable 63% of cases, JAK3 in 35% and GNAI2 in 24%, with the majority occurring at known activating hotspots in key functional domains. Moreover, STAT5B locus carried copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity resulting in the duplication of the mutant copy, suggesting the importance of mutant STAT5B dosage for the development of EITL. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT and GPCR pathways was also supported by gene expression profiling and further verified in patient tumor samples. In vitro overexpression of GNAI2 mutants led to the upregulation of pERK1/2, a member of MEK-ERK pathway. Notably, inhibitors of both JAK-STAT and MEK-ERK pathways effectively reduced viability of patient-derived primary EITL cells, indicating potential therapeutic strategies for this neoplasm with no effective treatment currently available.

AB Melanoma dedifferentiation, characterized by the loss of MITF and MITF regulated genes and by upregulation of stemness markers as CD271, is implicated in resistance to chemotherapy, target therapy and immunotherapy. The identification of intrinsic mechanisms fostering melanoma dedifferentiation may provide actionable therapeutic targets to improve current treatments. Here, we identify NFATc2 transcription factor as an intrinsic regulator of human melanoma dedifferentiation. In panels of melanoma cell lines, NFATc2 expression correlated inversely with MITF at both mRNA and protein levels. NFATc2(+/Hi) melanoma cell lines were CD271(+) and deficient for expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDAs) MART-1, gp100, tyrosinase and of GPNMB, PGC1-alpha and Rab27a, all regulated by MITF. Targeting of NFATc2 by small interfering RNA, short hairpin RNA and by an NFATc2 inhibitor upregulated MITF, MDAs, GPNMB, PGC-1alpha, tyrosinase activity and pigmentation and suppressed CD271. Mechanistically, we found that NFATc2 controls melanoma dedifferentiation by inducing expression in neoplastic cells of membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mTNF-alpha) and that melanoma-expressed TNF-alpha regulates a c-myc-Brn2 axis. Specifically, NFATc2, mTNF-alpha and expression of TNF receptors were significantly correlated in panels of cell lines. NFATc2 silencing suppressed TNF-alpha expression, and neutralization of melanoma-expressed TNF-alpha promoted melanoma differentiation. Moreover, silencing of NFATc2 and TNF-alpha neutralization downmodulated c-myc and POU3F2/Brn2. Brn2 was strongly expressed in NFATc2(+/Hi) MITF(Lo) cell lines and its silencing upregulated MITF. Targeting of c-myc, by silencing or by a c-myc inhibitor, suppressed Brn2 and upregulated MITF and MART-1 in melanoma cells. The relevance of NFATc2-dependent melanoma dedifferentiation for immune escape was shown by cytolytic T-cell assays. NFATc2(Hi) MITF(Lo) MDA(Lo) HLA-A2.1(+) melanoma cells were poorly recognized by MDA-specific and HLA-A2-restricted CTL lines, but NFATc2 targeting significantly increased CTL-mediated tumor recognition. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of NFATc2 promotes melanoma dedifferentiation and immune escape.

AB Biobank-based research is not specifically addressed in Indian statutory law and therefore Indian Council for Medical Research guidelines are the primary regulators of biobank research in India. The guidelines allow for broad consent and for any level of identification of specimens. Although privacy is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution, courts have limited this right when it conflicts with other rights or with the public interest. Furthermore, there is no established privacy test or actionable privacy right in the common law of India. In order to facilitate biobank-based research, both of these lacunae should be addressed by statutory law specifically addressing biobanking and more directly addressing the accompanying privacy concerns. A biobank-specific law should be written with international guidelines in mind, but harmonization with other laws should not be attempted until after India has created a law addressing biobank research within the unique legal and cultural environment of India. © 2016 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics.

AB With the number of prognostic and predictive genetic markers in neuro-oncology steadily growing, the need for comprehensive molecular analysis of neuropathology samples has vastly increased. We therefore developed a customized enrichment/hybrid-capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel comprising the entire coding and selected intronic and promoter regions of 130 genes recurrently altered in brain tumors, allowing for the detection of single nucleotide variations, fusions, and copy number aberrations. Optimization of probe design, library generation and sequencing conditions on 150 samples resulted in a 5-workday routine workflow from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sample to neuropathological report. This protocol was applied to 79 retrospective cases with established molecular aberrations for validation and 71 prospective cases for discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Concordance of NGS compared to established, single biomarker methods was 98.0%, with discrepancies resulting from one case where a TERT promoter mutation was not called by NGS and three ATRX mutations not being detected by Sanger sequencing. Importantly, in samples with low tumor cell content, NGS was able to identify mutant alleles that were not detectable by traditional methods. Information derived from NGS data identified potential targets for experimental therapy in 37/47 (79%) glioblastomas, 9/10 (90%) pilocytic astrocytomas, and 5/14 (36%) medulloblastomas in the prospective target discovery cohort. In conclusion, we present the settings for high-throughput, adaptive next-generation sequencing in routine neuropathology diagnostics. Such an approach will likely become highly valuable in the near future for treatment decision making, as more therapeutic targets emerge and genetic information enters the classification of brain tumors.

AB Kinase inhibitors are used widely to treat various cancers, but adaptive reprogramming of kinase cascades and activation of feedback loop mechanisms often contribute to therapeutic resistance. Determining comprehensive, accurate maps of kinase circuits may therefore help elucidate mechanisms of response and resistance to kinase inhibitor therapies. In this study, we identified and validated phosphorylatable target sites across human cell and tissue types to generate PhosphoAtlas, a map of 1,733 functionally interconnected proteins comprising the human phospho-reactome. A systematic curation approach was used to distill protein phosphorylation data cross-referenced from 38 public resources. We demonstrated how a catalog of 2,617 stringently verified heptameric peptide regions at the catalytic interface of kinases and substrates could expose mutations that recurrently perturb specific phospho-hubs. In silico mapping of 2,896 nonsynonymous tumor variants identified from thousands of tumor tissues also revealed that normal and aberrant catalytic interactions co-occur frequently, showing how tumors systematically hijack, as well as spare, particular subnetworks. Overall, our work provides an important new resource for interrogating the human tumor kinome to strategically identify therapeutically actionable kinase networks that drive tumorigenesis.

AB Many signal transduction inhibitors are being developed for cancer therapy target pathways that are also important for the proper function of antitumor lymphocytes, possibly weakening their therapeutic effects. Here we show that most inhibitors targeting multiple signaling pathways have especially strong negative effects on T-cell activation at their active doses on cancer cells. In particular, we found that recently approved MEK inhibitors displayed potent suppressive effects on T cells in vitro However, these effects could be attenuated by certain cytokines that can be administered to cancer patients. Among them, clinically available IL15 superagonists, which can activate PI3K selectively in T lymphocytes, synergized with MEK inhibitors in vivo to elicit potent and durable antitumor responses, including by a vaccine-like effect that generated resistance to tumor rechallenge. Our work identifies a clinically actionable approach to overcome the T-cell-suppressive effects of MEK inhibitors and illustrates how to reconcile the deficiencies of signal transduction inhibitors, which impede desired immunologic effects in vivo Cancer Res; 76(9); 2561-72. ©2016 AACR. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB The use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is guided by the presence of activating point mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146 of the KRAS and NRAS genes in the primary tumor. Although these mutations have been incorporated into the prescribing information for both cetuximab and panitumumab, highlighted in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, and routinely tested, a number of controversial issues and unanswered questions related to these mutations and their clinical significance remain. In the present review, we explored the contradictory data related to the prognostic value of KRAS mutations, the reported frequent discordance of KRAS mutations, and the reported nonequivalence of some of these mutations. We also considered the issues related to incorporating additional mutations into the already accredited and approved assays and the challenges created by changing an assay's analytical and clinical limits of detection. We also discuss the lack of biologic data supporting the pathogenicity of newly described clinically actionable mutations and explore the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of low-frequency mutations, highlighting the importance of correcting allele frequencies for tumor purity. We also considered the importance of distinguishing the significance of low-frequency RAS mutations in tumors previously not treated or treated with anti-EGFR therapies and explore new technologies capable of detecting emerging polyclonal RAS mutations that appear to confer drug resistance.

AB INTRODUCTION: In genomics and other fields, it is now possible to capture and store large amounts of data in electronic medical records (EMRs). However, it is not clear if the routine accumulation of massive amounts of (largely uninterpretable) data will yield any health benefits to patients. Nevertheless, the use of large-scale medical data is likely to grow. To meet emerging challenges and facilitate optimal use of genomic data, our institution initiated a comprehensive planning process that addresses the needs of all stakeholders (e.g., patients, families, healthcare providers, researchers, technical staff, administrators). Our experience with this process and a key genomics research project contributed to the proposed framework.; FRAMEWORK: We propose a two-pronged Genomic Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that encompasses the concept of the "Clinical Mendeliome" as a patient-centric list of genomic variants that are clinically actionable and introduces the concept of the "Archival Value Criterion" as a decision-making formalism that approximates the cost-effectiveness of capturing, storing, and curating genome-scale sequencing data. We describe a prototype Genomic CDSS that we developed as a first step toward implementation of the framework.; CONCLUSION: The proposed framework and prototype solution are designed to address the perspectives of stakeholders, stimulate effective clinical use of genomic data, drive genomic research, and meet current and future needs. The framework also can be broadly applied to additional fields, including other '-omics' fields. We advocate for the creation of a Task Force on the Clinical Mendeliome, charged with defining Clinical Mendeliomes and drafting clinical guidelines for their use.

AB OBJECTIVES: Small cell cervical cancer is a rare malignancy with limited treatment options for recurrent disease. We sought to determine if tumor specimens of small cell cervical cancer harbor common somatic mutations and if any of these are actionable.; METHODS: Using a registry of patients with neuroendocrine cervical cancer, we identified 44 patients with pure or mixed small cell cervical cancer who had undergone mutational analysis. Mutations had been detected using next generation sequencing of mutational hotspots in 50 cancer-related genes.; RESULTS: Thirty-five mutations were identified in 24 patients (55%). Fifteen of these 24 patients (63%) had 1 mutation, 7 patients (29%) had 2 mutations, and 2 patients (8%) had 3 mutations. In all 44 patients, the most commonly seen mutations were mutations in PIK3CA (8 patients; 18%), KRAS (6 patients; 14%), and TP53 (5 patients; 11%). No other mutation was found in >7% of specimens. Of the 24 patients who had a mutation, 21 (88%) had at least 1 alteration for which there currently exists a class of biological agents targeting that mutation. In the entire cohort of 44 patients, 48% had at least 1 actionable mutation.; CONCLUSION: Although no single mutation was found in the majority of patients with small cell cervical cancer, almost half had at least 1 actionable mutation. As treatment options for patients with recurrent small cell cervical cancer are currently very limited, molecular testing for targetable mutations, which may suggest potential therapeutic strategies, may be useful for clinicians and patients.

AB Mendelian mutations are the most medically actionable variants in the human genome and have always played a central role in its functional annotation. Despite the relative ease with which Mendelian mutations are identified compared to other classes of variants, the pace of their discovery has until recently been slow. However, recent technological advances in genomic sequencing have made the prospect of identifying all genes that can harbor Mendelian mutations an achievable near-term goal. The many lessons learned from previous discoveries of Mendelian mutations should inform future studies as I will discuss in this review. Also discussed are some of the challenges that will gain more prominence as we approach the last phase of the effort to map all Mendelian genes.

AB BACKGROUND: Awareness campaigns are ubiquitous, but little is known about their potential effectiveness because traditional evaluations are often unfeasible. For 40 years, the "Great American Smokeout" (GASO) has encouraged media coverage and popular engagement with smoking cessation on the third Thursday of November as the nation's longest running awareness campaign.; OBJECTIVE: We proposed a novel evaluation framework for assessing awareness campaigns using the GASO as a case study by observing cessation-related news reports and Twitter postings, and cessation-related help seeking via Google, Wikipedia, and government-sponsored quitlines.; METHODS: Time trends (2009-2014) were analyzed using a quasi-experimental design to isolate spikes during the GASO by comparing observed outcomes on the GASO day with the simulated counterfactual had the GASO not occurred.; RESULTS: Cessation-related news typically increased by 61% (95% CI 35-87) and tweets by 13% (95% CI -21 to 48) during the GASO compared with what was expected had the GASO not occurred. Cessation-related Google searches increased by 25% (95% CI 10-40), Wikipedia page visits by 22% (95% CI -26 to 67), and quitline calls by 42% (95% CI 19-64). Cessation-related news media positively coincided with cessation tweets, Internet searches, and Wikipedia visits; for example, a 50% increase in news for any year predicted a 28% (95% CI -2 to 59) increase in tweets for the same year. Increases on the day of the GASO rivaled about two-thirds of a typical New Year's Day-the day that is assumed to see the greatest increases in cessation-related activity. In practical terms, there were about 61,000 more instances of help seeking on Google, Wikipedia, or quitlines on GASO each year than would normally be expected.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide actionable intelligence to improve the GASO and model how to rapidly, cost-effectively, and efficiently evaluate hundreds of awareness campaigns, nearly all for the first time.

AB Oriented neuronal networks with controlled connectivity are required for many applications ranging from studies of neurodegeneration to neuronal computation. To build such networks in vitro, an efficient, directed and long lasting guidance of axons toward their target is a pre-requisite. The best guidance achieved so far, however, relies on confining axons in enclosed microchannels, making them poorly accessible for further investigation. Here we describe a method providing accessible and highly regular arrays of axons, emanating from somas positioned in distinct compartments. This method combines the use of a novel removable partition, allowing soma positioning outside of the axon guidance patterns, and in-mold patterning (iMP), a hybrid method combining chemical and mechanical cell positioning clues applied here for the first time to neurons. The axon guidance efficiency of iMP is compared to that of conventional patterning methods, e.g. micro-contact printing (chemical constraints by a poly-l-lysine motif) and micro-grooves (physical constraints by homogeneously coated microstructures), using guiding tracks of different widths and spacing. We show that iMP provides a gain of 10 to 100 in axon confinement efficiency on the tracks, yielding mm-long, highly regular, and fully accessible on-chip axon arrays. iMP also allows well-defined axon guidance from small populations of several neurons confined at predefined positions in mum-sized wells. iMP will thus open new routes for the construction of complex and accurately controlled neuronal networks.

AB Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a treatment-refractory primary liver cancer with an increasing incidence and mortality worldwide in recent years. Lack of a stereotyped genetic signature and limited understanding of genomic landscape make the development of effective targeted therapies challenging. Recent application of advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) has broadened our understanding of genetic heterogeneity in iCCA and many potentially actionable genetic alterations have been identified. This review explores the recent advances in defining genetic alterations in iCCAs, which may present potent therapeutic targets. Chromatin remodeling genes and genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase and tyrosine kinase receptors as well as their downstream effectors are among the most frequently altered genes. Clinical trials testing the effect of new targeted agents on iCCA patients, especially those with the above genetic markers are under way. However, the complex interplay of environmental and evolutionary factors contributing to the genetic variability in iCCA calls for a more cautionary use of NGS in tailoring targeted regimen to the patients. Next-generation functional testing may complement NGS to execute precision medicine in future.

AB Molecular studies in ovarian serous borderline tumors (OSBTs) have been used to understand different aspects of this neoplasm. (i) Pathogenesis, Kras and Braf mutations represent very early events in the tumorigenesis of OSBT as both are detected in serous cystadenomas associated with OSBTs. In contrast, serous cystadenomas without OSBTs do not show Kras or Braf mutations. In OSBTs, Kras mutations range from 17% to 39.5%, while Braf mutations range from 23% to 48%. The former is comparable with the range of Kras mutations in ovarian low-grade serous carcinomas (OLGSCa), 19%-54.5%. In contrast, Braf mutations in OLGSCa range from 0% to 33%. Serous cystadenomas appear to progress to OSBT due to a Braf mutation, but this mutation is rarely involved in the progression to OLGSCa. OSBTs with Braf mutation are associated with cellular senescence and up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, OSBTs without a Braf mutation may progress to OLGSCa due to Kras mutation or some other genetic alterations. (ii) The relationship between OSBTs and the extraovarian disease, a monoclonal versus mutifocal origin? This is still matter of debate as studies using different techniques have failed to settle this controversy. (iii) Biological behavior, Braf mutations appear to have a protective role against the progression of OSBT to OLGSCa, while Kras mutations are commonly seen in cases of OSBT that recurred as LGSCa. Nevertheless, LGSCa as a recurrence of an OSBT can originate from OSBTs with or without detectable Kras mutations. Also, it appears to be an association between Kras G12v mutation and a more aggressive phenotype of OSBT that recurred as LGSCa. (iv) Actionable targets, currently there are limited data. It has been reported that cancer cell lines with Kras G12v mutation are more sensitive to selumetinib than cell lines with wild-type Kras. © The Author 2016.

AB An individual's sex has been long recognized as a key factor affecting cancer incidence, prognosis, and treatment responses. However, the molecular basis for sex disparities in cancer remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive analysis of molecular differences between male and female patients in 13 cancer types of The Cancer Genome Atlas and revealed two sex-effect groups associated with distinct incidence and mortality profiles. One group contains a small number of sex-affected genes, whereas the other shows much more extensive sex-biased molecular signatures. Importantly, 53% of clinically actionable genes (60/114) show sex-biased signatures. Our study provides a systematic molecular-level understanding of sex effects in diverse cancers and suggests a pressing need to develop sex-specific therapeutic strategies in certain cancer types.

AB Genomic profiling of tumours in patients in clinical trials enables rapid testing of multiple hypotheses to confirm which genomic events determine likely responder groups for targeted agents. A key challenge of this new capability is defining which specific genomic events should be classified as 'actionable' (that is, potentially responsive to a targeted therapy), especially when looking for early indications of patient subgroups likely to be responsive to new drugs. This Opinion article discusses some of the different approaches being taken in early clinical development to define actionable mutations, and describes our strategy to address this challenge in early-stage exploratory clinical trials.

AB This paper illustrates an approach to setting the decision framework for a study in early clinical drug development. It shows how the criteria for a go and a stop decision are calculated based on pre-specified target and lower reference values. The framework can lead to a three-outcome approach by including a consider zone; this could enable smaller studies to be performed in early development, with other information either external to or within the study used to reach a go or stop decision. In this way, Phase I/II trials can be geared towards providing actionable decision-making rather than the traditional focus on statistical significance. The example provided illustrates how the decision criteria were calculated for a Phase II study, including an interim analysis, and how the operating characteristics were assessed to ensure the decision criteria were robust.

AB Targeted next-generation sequencing is becoming increasingly common as a clinical diagnostic and prognostic test for patient- and tumor-specific genetic profiles as well as to optimally select targeted therapies. Here, we describe a custom-developed, next-generation sequencing test for detecting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) in 93 genes related to gastrointestinal cancer from routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded clinical specimens. We implemented a validation strategy, based on the College of American Pathologists requirements, using reference DNA mixtures from cell lines with known genetic variants, which model a broad range of allele frequencies. Test sensitivity achieved >99% for both SNVs and indels, with allele frequencies >10%, with high specificity (97.4% for SNVs and 93.6% for indels). We further confirmed test accuracies using primary formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer specimens characterized by alternative and conventional clinical diagnostic technologies. Robust performance was observed on the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens: sensitivity was 97.2% and specificity was 99.2%. We also observed high intrarun and inter-run reproducibility, as well as a low cross-contamination rate. Overall assessment using cell line samples and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples showed that our custom next-generation sequencing assay has consistent detection sensitivity down to 10% variant frequency.

AB Significant barriers, such as lack of professional guidelines, specialized training for interpretation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) data, and insufficient evidence to support clinical utility, prevent preemptive PGx testing from being widely clinically implemented. The current study, as a pilot project for the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Time-Using Genomic Data to Individualize Treatment Protocol, was designed to evaluate the impact of preemptive PGx and to optimize the workflow in the clinic setting. We used an 84-gene next-generation sequencing panel that included SLCO1B1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and VKORC1 together with a custom-designed CYP2D6 testing cascade to genotype the 1013 subjects in laboratories approved by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. Actionable PGx variants were placed in patient's electronic medical records where integrated clinical decision support rules alert providers when a relevant medication is ordered. The fraction of this cohort carrying actionable PGx variant(s) in individual genes ranged from 30% (SLCO1B1) to 79% (CYP2D6). When considering all five genes together, 99% of the subjects carried an actionable PGx variant(s) in at least one gene. Our study provides evidence in favor of preemptive PGx testing by identifying the risk of a variant being present in the population we studied.

AB BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing in cancer research may reveal germline variants of clinical significance. We report patient preferences for return of results and the prevalence of incidental pathogenic germline variants (PGVs).; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Targeted exome sequencing of 202 genes was carried out in 1000 advanced cancers using tumor and normal DNA in a research laboratory. Pathogenic variants in 18 genes, recommended for return by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, as well as PALB2, were considered actionable. Patient preferences of return of incidental germline results were collected. Return of results was initiated with genetic counseling and repeat CLIA testing.; RESULTS: Of the 1000 patients who underwent sequencing, 43 had likely PGVs: APC (1), BRCA1 (11), BRCA2 (10), TP53 (10), MSH2 (1), MSH6 (4), PALB2 (2), PTEN (2), TSC2 (1), and RB1 (1). Twenty (47%) of 43 variants were previously known based on clinical genetic testing. Of the 1167 patients who consented for a germline testing protocol, 1157 (99%) desired to be informed of incidental results. Twenty-three previously unrecognized mutations identified in the research environment were confirmed with an orthogonal CLIA platform. All patients approached decided to proceed with formal genetic counseling; in all cases where formal genetic testing was carried out, the germline variant of concern validated with clinical genetic testing.; CONCLUSIONS: In this series, 2.3% patients had previously unrecognized pathogenic germline mutations in 19 cancer-related genes. Thus, genomic sequencing must be accompanied by a plan for return of germline results, in partnership with genetic counseling. © The Author 2016.

AB PURPOSE: As genome-scale sequencing is increasingly applied in clinical scenarios, a wide variety of genomic findings will be discovered as secondary or incidental findings, and there is debate about how they should be handled. The clinical actionability of such findings varies, necessitating standardized frameworks for a priori decision making about their analysis.; METHODS: We established a semiquantitative metric to assess five elements of actionability: severity and likelihood of the disease outcome, efficacy and burden of intervention, and knowledge base, with a total score from 0 to 15.; RESULTS: The semiquantitative metric was applied to a list of putative actionable conditions, the list of genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for return when deleterious variants are discovered as secondary/incidental findings, and a random sample of 1,000 genes. Scores from the list of putative actionable conditions (median = 12) and the ACMG list (median = 11) were both statistically different than the randomly selected genes (median = 7) (P < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test).; CONCLUSION: Gene-disease pairs having a score of 11 or higher represent the top quintile of actionability. The semiquantitative metric effectively assesses clinical actionability, promotes transparency, and may facilitate assessments of clinical actionability by various groups and in diverse contexts.Genet Med 18 5, 467-475.

AB We evaluated the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted anticancer therapy in refractory solid tumors at a Korean institution. Thirty-six patients with advanced cancer underwent molecular profiling with NGS with the intent of clinical application of available matched targeted agents. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors were sequenced using the Comprehensive Cancer Panel (CCP) or FoundationOne in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory in the USA. Response evaluations were performed according to RECIST v1.1. Four specimens did not pass the DNA quality test and 32 specimens were successfully sequenced with CCP (n = 31) and FoundationOne (n = 1). Of the 32 sequenced patients, 10 (31.3%) were ≤40 years. Twelve patients (37.5%) had received ≥3 types of prior systemic therapies. Of 24 patients with actionable mutations, five were given genotype-matched drugs corresponding to actionable mutations: everolimus to PIK3CA mutation in parotid carcinosarcoma (partial response) and tracheal squamous cell carcinoma (stable disease; 21% reduction), sorafenib to PDGFRA mutation in auditory canal adenocarcinoma (partial response), sorafenib to BRAF mutation in microcytic adnexal carcinoma (progressive disease), and afatinib to ERBB2 mutation in esophageal adenocarcinoma (progressive disease). Nineteen of 24 patients with actionable mutations could not undergo targeted therapy based on genomic testing because of declining performance status (10/24, 41.7%), stable disease with previous treatment (5/24, 20.8%), and lack of access to targeted medication (4/24, 16.7%). NGS-based targeted therapy may be a good option in selected patients with refractory solid tumors. To pursue this strategy in Korea, lack of access to clinical-grade NGS assays and a limited number of genotype-matched targeted medications needs to be addressed and resolved.

AB Data in the biological, chemical, and clinical domains are accumulating at ever-increasing rates and have the potential to accelerate and inform drug development in new ways. Challenges and opportunities now lie in developing analytic tools to transform these often complex and heterogeneous data into testable hypotheses and actionable insights. This is the aim of computational pharmacology, which uses in silico techniques to better understand and predict how drugs affect biological systems, which can in turn improve clinical use, avoid unwanted side effects, and guide selection and development of better treatments. One exciting application of computational pharmacology is drug repurposing-finding new uses for existing drugs. Already yielding many promising candidates, this strategy has the potential to improve the efficiency of the drug development process and reach patient populations with previously unmet needs such as those with rare diseases. While current techniques in computational pharmacology and drug repurposing often focus on just a single data modality such as gene expression or drug-target interactions, we argue that methods such as matrix factorization that can integrate data within and across diverse data types have the potential to improve predictive performance and provide a fuller picture of a drug's pharmacological action.

AB Childhood obesity and its sequelae are a major public health problem in both the USA and globally. This review will focus on a systems medicine approach to obesity. Systems medicine is an integrative approach utilizing the vast amount of data garnered from "omics" technology and integrating these data with conventional pathophysiology as well as diverse environmental factors such as diet, exercise, community dynamics and the intestinal microbiome. Omics technology includes genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, metabolomics and proteomics. In addition to unraveling etiology, the goals of a systems medicine approach are to provide actionable and evidenced-based clinical approaches. In the case of childhood obesity, an additional goal is characterizing measureable risk factors/biomarkers for obesity at the earliest possible age and devising age-appropriate optimal intervention strategies. It is also important to establish the age at which interventions could be critical. As discussed below, it is possible that some of the pathophysiological and epigenetic changes resulting from childhood obesity could become more irreversible the longer the obesity remains untreated.

AB PURPOSE: This study investigated how genome sequencing results affect health behaviors, affect, and communication.; METHODS: We report on 29 participants who received a sequence result in the ClinSeq study, a cohort of well-educated, postreproductive volunteers. A mixed-methods design was used to explore respondents' use, communication, and perceived utility of results.; RESULTS: Most participants (72%) shared their result with at least one health-care provider, and 31% reported subsequent changes in the health care they received. Participants scored high on the Positive Experiences subscale and low on the Distress subscale of a modified version of the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment. The majority (93%) shared their result with at least one family member. Participants described deriving personal utility from their results.; CONCLUSION: This article is the first to describe research participants' reactions to actionable sequencing results. Our findings suggest clinical and personal benefit from receiving sequencing results, both of which may contribute to improved health for the recipients. Given the participants' largely positive or neutral affective responses and disclosure of their results to physicians and relatives, health-care providers should redirect concern from the potential for distress and attend to motivating patients to follow their medical recommendations.Genet Med 18 6, 577-583.

AB PURPOSE: Utilization of sequencing to screen the general population for preventable monogenic conditions is receiving substantial attention because of its potential to decrease morbidity and mortality. However, the selection of which variants to return is a serious implementation challenge. Procedures must be investigated to ensure optimal test characteristics and avoidance of harm from false-positive test results.; METHODS: We scanned exome sequences from 478 well-phenotyped individuals for potentially pathogenic variants in 17 genes representing 11 conditions that are among the most medically actionable Mendelian disorders in adults. We developed five variant selection algorithms with increasing sensitivity and measured their specificity in these 17 genes.; RESULTS: Variant selection algorithms with increasing sensitivity exhibited decreased specificity, and performance was highly dependent on the genes analyzed. The most sensitive algorithm ranged from 88.8 to 99.6% specificity among the 17 genes.; CONCLUSION: For conditions with very low prevalence, small reductions in specificity greatly increase false positives. This inescapable test characteristic governs the predictive value of genomic sequencing in the general population. To address this issue, test performance must be evaluated systematically for each condition so that the false negatives and false positives can be tailored for optimal outcomes, depending on the downstream clinical consequences.Genet Med 18 6, 593-599.

AB More than 80% of the HIV-infected adolescents live in sub-Saharan Africa. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related mortality has increased among adolescents 10-19 y old. The impact is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where >80% of HIV-infected adolescents live. The World Health Organization has cited inadequate access to HIV testing and counseling (HTC) as a contributing factor to AIDS-related adolescent deaths, most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. This review focuses on studies conducted in high adolescent HIV-burden countries targeted by the "All In to End Adolescent AIDS" initiative, and describes barriers to adolescent HTC uptake and coverage. Fear of stigma and family reaction, fear of the impact of a positive diagnosis, perceived risk with respect to sexual exposure, poor attitudes of healthcare providers, and parental consent requirements are identified as major impediments. Most-at-risk adolescents for HIV infection and missed opportunities for testing include, those perinatally infected, those with early sexual debut, high mobility and multiple/older partners, and pregnant and nonpregnant females. Regional analyses show relatively low adolescent testing rates and more restrictive consent requirements for HTC in West and Central Africa as compared to East and southern Africa. Actionable recommendations for widening adolescent access to HTC and therefore timely care include minimizing legal consent barriers, healthcare provider training, parental education and involvement, and expanding testing beyond healthcare facilities.

AB The United States provides an example of a country with (a) legal tobacco/nicotine products (e.g., snus, other smokeless tobacco, cigarettes) differing greatly in risks to health and (b) respected health information websites that continue to omit or provide incorrect differential risk information. Concern for the principles of individual rights, health literacy, and personal autonomy (making decisions for oneself), which are key principles of public health ethics, has been countered by utilitarian arguments for the use of misleading or limited information to protect public health overall. We argue that omitting key health relevant information for current or prospective consumers represents a kind of quarantine of health-relevant information. As with disease quarantines, the coercive effects of quarantining information on differential risks need to be justified, not merely by fears of net negative public health effects, but by convincing evidence that such measures are actually warranted, that public health overall is in imminent danger and that the danger is sufficient to override principles of individual autonomy. Omitting such health-relevant information for consumers of such products effectively blindfolds them and impairs their making informed personal choices. Moral psychological issues that treat all tobacco/nicotine products similarly may also be influencing the reluctance to inform on differential risks. In countries where tobacco/nicotine products are legally sold and also differ greatly in disease risks compared to cigarettes (e.g., smokeless tobacco and vape), science-based, comprehensible, and actionable health information (consistent with health literacy principles) on differential risks should be available and only reconsidered if it is established that this information is causing losses to population health overall.

AB One of the major impediments in human aging research is the absence of a comprehensive and actionable set of biomarkers that may be targeted and measured to track the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. In this study, we designed a modular ensemble of 21 deep neural networks (DNNs) of varying depth, structure and optimization to predict human chronological age using a basic blood test. To train the DNNs, we used over 60,000 samples from common blood biochemistry and cell count tests from routine health exams performed by a single laboratory and linked to chronological age and sex. The best performing DNN in the ensemble demonstrated 81.5 % epsilon-accuracy r = 0.90 with R(2) = 0.80 and MAE = 6.07 years in predicting chronological age within a 10 year frame, while the entire ensemble achieved 83.5% epsilon-accuracy r = 0.91 with R(2) = 0.82 and MAE = 5.55 years. The ensemble also identified the 5 most important markers for predicting human chronological age: albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, urea and erythrocytes. To allow for public testing and evaluate real-life performance of the predictor, we developed an online system available at http://www.aging.ai. The ensemble approach may facilitate integration of multi-modal data linked to chronological age and sex that may lead to simple, minimally invasive, and affordable methods of tracking integrated biomarkers of aging in humans and performing cross-species feature importance analysis.

AB OBJECTIVE: The proposed Meaningful Use Stage 3 recommendations require healthcare providers to accept patient-generated health data (PGHD) by 2017. Yet, we know little about the tensions that arise in supporting the needs of both patients and providers in this context. We sought to examine these tensions when designing a novel, patient-centered technology - mobile Post-Operative Wound Evaluator (mPOWEr) - that uses PGHD for post-discharge surgical wound monitoring.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of the iterative design process of mPOWEr, we conducted semistructured interviews and think-aloud sessions using mockups with surgical patients and providers. We asked participants how mPOWEr could enhance the current post-discharge process for surgical patients, then used grounded theory to develop themes related to conflicts and agreements between patients and providers.; RESULTS: We identified four areas of agreement: providing contextual metadata, accessible and actionable data presentation, building on existing sociotechnical systems, and process transparency. We identified six areas of conflict, with patients preferring: more flexibility in data input, frequent data transfer, text-based communication, patient input in provider response prioritization, timely and reliable provider responses, and definitive diagnoses.; DISCUSSION: We present design implications and potential solutions to the identified conflicts for each theme, illustrated using our work on mPOWEr. Our experience highlights the importance of bringing a variety of stakeholders, including patients, into the design process for PGHD applications.; CONCLUSION: We have identified critical barriers to integrating PGHD into clinical care and describe design implications to help address these barriers. Our work informs future efforts to ensure the smooth integration of essential PGHD into clinical practice. © The Author 2016.

AB Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly type of brain cancer. Over the past decade, several divergent genetic pathways have been implicated in the initiation, progression and clinical outcome of this disease. As our understanding of GBM expands and identifies actionable targets specific to individual tumors, there will be a pressing need for the development of new tools that will maximize the use of limited clinical samples to enable the employment of personalized care paradigms. We used PrimePCR validated assays to generate a custom real-time PCR screening panel, containing 74 previously published mRNA targets showing gene expression changes in glioblastoma, and five house-keeping genes. A cohort of 19 frozen brain specimens were analyzed, including WHO Grade II oligodendroglioma (n = 3), WHO Grade II astrocytoma (n = 2), WHO Grade III astrocytoma (n = 1), and glioblastoma (n = 13). Four normal brain samples were also analyzed. We performed RNA extraction, followed by cDNA synthesis, multiplexed pre-amplification and SYBR-based qPCR, to generate expression profiles on all samples. We demonstrated that the workflow shows high tolerance to variation in RNA quality (RIN 8.5-4) and high sensitivity in detection. cDNA input that is equivalent to 3 ng of starting RNA was sufficient to conduct accurate semiquantitative analysis of the panel of 79 assays. Using principal component analysis, we were able to accurately separate glioblastoma from low-grade glioma. The two WHO Grade III tumors analyzed clustered with glioblastoma, but showed more similarity to Grade II gliomas. In this study, we have shown the feasibility of consolidating high-throughput data into a single functional panel capable of accurately classifying glioma specimens based solely on semiquantitative gene expression profiling.

AB The Fontan operation is the anticipated palliative strategy for children born with single-ventricle type of congenital heart disease. As a result of important circulatory limitations, a series of end-organ complications are now increasingly recognized. Elevated central venous pressure and impaired cardiac output are the hallmarks of cavo-pulmonary flow, which result in a cascade of pathophysiological consequences. The Fontan circulation likely impacts all organ systems in an indolent and relentless manner, with progressive decline in functionality likely to occur in many. Liver fibrosis, altered bone density, decreased muscle mass, renal dysfunction, lymphatic insufficiency, and a host of other conditions are present. Standardized screening and evaluation of survivors as they grow through childhood and beyond is indicated and can be facilitated through dedicated multidisciplinary clinical programs. Invasive assessment at specific milestones can provide important actionable information to optimize individual status. More detailed characterization and understanding of these end-organ complications is necessary to contribute to the goal of achieving a normal duration and quality of life for these unique individuals.

AB BACKGROUND: Engaging community partners in research has the potential to make findings higher quality, more actionable, and more meaningful. Less rigorous approaches, often used by community-engaged partnerships, may diminish data quality.; OBJECTIVE: This study highlights the key guiding principles of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, particularly in regards to improving rigor, for a door-to-door health survey conducted by promotoras in a low-income, Latino neighborhood in San Jose, California.; METHODS: We describe the partnership formed to conduct the study and the participatory process used throughout the study in questionnaire and sample design, training, and survey administration that adheres to key CBPR principles.; LESSONS LEARNED: Our participatory approach required building the capacity of partners, having all partners weigh in on issues that arose in the field, enlisting outside expertise, being responsive to partner concerns while adhering to validated survey methods, simplifying sample design, incorporating expectations for data quality into training, and dedicating sufficient staffing to survey administration.; CONCLUSION: The procedures, materials, and tools used by the community-engaged partnership in this study can be replicated by other community partnerships seeking to improve the quality of data used for decision making, program planning, and resource allocation.

AB Compound EGFR mutations, defined as double or multiple mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, are frequently detected with advances in sequencing technology but its clinical significance is unclear. This study analyzed 61 cases of EGFR mutation positive lung adenocarcinoma using next-generation sequencing (NGS) based repeated deep sequencing panel of 16 genes that contain actionable mutations and investigated clinical implication of compound EGFR mutations. Compound EGFR mutation was detected in 15 (24.6%) of 61 cases of EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. The majority (12/15) of compound mutations are combination of the atypical mutation and typical mutations such as exon19 deletion, L858R or G719X substitutions, or exon 20 insertion whereas 3 were combinations of rare atypical mutations. The patients with compound mutation showed shorter overall survival than those with simple mutations (83.7 vs. 72.8 mo; P = 0.020, Breslow test). Among the 115 missense mutations discovered in the tested genes, a few number of actionable mutations were detected irrelevant to the subtype of EGFR mutations, including ALK rearrangement, BCL2L11 intron 2 deletion, KRAS c.35G>A, PIK3CA c.1633G>A which are possible target of crizotinib, BH3 mimetics, MEK inhibitors, and PI3K-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, respectively. 31 missense mutations were detected in the cases with simple mutations whereas 84 in those with compound mutation, showing that the cases with compound missense mutation have higher burden of missense mutations (P = 0.001, independent sample t-test). Compound EGFR mutations are detected at a high frequency using NGS-based repeated deep sequencing.

AB Using examples of incidents that UK Police Forces deal with on a day-to-day basis, we explore the macrocognition of incident response. Central to our analysis is the idea that information relating to an incident is translated from negotiated to structured and actionable meaning, in terms of the Community of Practice of the personnel involved in incident response. Through participant observation of, and interviews with, police personnel, we explore the manner in which these different types of meaning shift over the course of incident. In this way, macrocognition relates to gathering, framing, and sharing information through the collaborative sensemaking practices of those involved. This involves two cycles of macrocognition, which we see as 'informal' (driven by information gathering as the Community of Practice negotiates and actions meaning) and 'formal' (driven by the need to assign resources to the response and the need to record incident details). The examples illustrate that these cycles are often intertwined, as are the different forms of meaning, in situation-specific ways that provide adaptive response to the demands of the incident.

AB BACKGROUND: Short tandem repeat (STR) analysis of casework samples with low DNA content include those resulting from the transfer of epithelial cells from the skin to an object (e.g., cells on a water bottle, or brim of a cap), blood spatter stains, and small bone and tissue fragments. Low DNA content (LDC) samples are important in a wide range of settings, including disaster response teams to assist in victim identification and family reunification, military operations to identify friend or foe, criminal forensics to identify suspects and exonerate the innocent, and medical examiner and coroner offices to identify missing persons. Processing LDC samples requires experienced laboratory personnel, isolated workstations, and sophisticated equipment, requires transport time, and involves complex procedures. We present a rapid DNA analysis system designed specifically to generate STR profiles from LDC samples in field-forward settings by non-technical operators. By performing STR in the field, close to the site of collection, rapid DNA analysis has the potential to increase throughput and to provide actionable information in real time.; RESULTS: A Low DNA Content BioChipSet (LDC BCS) was developed and manufactured by injection molding. It was designed to function in the fully integrated Accelerated Nuclear DNA Equipment (ANDE) instrument previously designed for analysis of buccal swab and other high DNA content samples (Investigative Genet. 4(1):1-15, 2013). The LDC BCS performs efficient DNA purification followed by microfluidic ultrafiltration of the purified DNA, maximizing the quantity of DNA available for subsequent amplification and electrophoretic separation and detection of amplified fragments. The system demonstrates accuracy, precision, resolution, signal strength, and peak height ratios appropriate for casework analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: The LDC rapid DNA analysis system is effective for the generation of STR profiles from a wide range of sample types. The technology broadens the range of sample types that can be processed and minimizes the time between sample collection, sample processing and analysis, and generation of actionable intelligence. The fully integrated Expert System is capable of interpreting a wide range or sample types and input DNA quantities, allowing samples to be processed and interpreted without a technical operator.

AB BACKGROUND: While broad-based societal efforts to improve public health have targeted disorders such as cardiovascular disease and cancer for several decades, efforts devoted to kidney disease have developed only more recently. The Peer Kidney Care Initiative, a novel effort designed to address knowledge gaps in the care of patients with kidney disease, examines key disease processes, the roles of geography and seasonality on outcomes, and longitudinal trends in outcomes over time.; SUMMARY: Admissions for gastrointestinal bleeds increased approximately 28% between 2004 and 2011 in prevalent patients. Infection with Clostridium difficile increased nearly 70% between 2003 and 2010 in patients within a year of initiation. Admissions for heart failure in prevalent patients decreased approximately 25% between 2004 and 2012, but admissions for volume overload increased a nearly equal amount. Incidence rates varied substantially by geographic region, such that unadjusted rates in the highest region were nearly double than those in the lowest. There was seasonal variation in all-cause mortality of approximately 15-20% in both incident and prevalent patients, suggesting a link between cardiovascular events and seasonally related environmental conditions. New cases of end-stage renal disease fell from 385 per million population in 2003 to 344 in 2012, a decline of approximately 10%.; KEY MESSAGES: Peer complements existing kidney disease epidemiologic efforts by examining specific actionable disease entities, exploring geographic variation in care, highlighting the role of seasonality on outcomes, and emphasizing the importance of trending outcomes over time as overall societal progress is being made. © 2016 S.

AB CONTEXT: Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are a rare tumor type with a poor five-year survival rate and limited treatment options.; OBJECTIVE: Understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease has been aided by genomic analyses highlighting alterations in TP53, WNT, and IGF signaling pathways. Further elucidation is needed to reveal therapeutically actionable targets in ACC.; DESIGN: In this study, global DNA methylation levels were assessed by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Array on 18 ACC tumors and 6 normal adrenal tissues. A new, non-linear correlation approach, the discretization method, assessed the relationship between DNA methylation/gene expression across ACC tumors.; RESULTS: This correlation analysis revealed epigenetic regulation of genes known to modulate TP53, WNT, and IGF signaling, as well as silencing of the tumor suppressor MARCKS, previously unreported in ACC.; CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation may regulate genes known to play a role in ACC pathogenesis as well as known tumor suppressors.

AB BACKGROUND: In vitro diagnostic (IVD) investigations are indispensable for routine patient management. Appropriate testing allows early-stage interventions, reducing late-stage healthcare expenditure (HCE).; AIM: To investigate HCE on IVDs in two developed markets and to assess the perceived value of IVDs on clinical decision-making. Physician-perceived HCE on IVD was evaluated, as well as desired features of new diagnostic markers.; METHODS: Past and current HCE on IVD was calculated for the US and Germany. A total of 79 US/German oncologists and cardiologists were interviewed to assess the number of cases where: physicians ask for IVDs; IVDs are used for initial diagnosis, treatment monitoring, or post-treatment; and decision-making is based on an IVD test result. A sample of 201 US and German oncologists and cardiologists was questioned regarding the proportion of HCE they believed to be attributable to IVD testing. After disclosing the actual IVD HCE, the physician's perception of the appropriateness of the amount was captured. Finally, the association between physician-rated impact of IVD on decision-making and perceived contribution of IVD expenditure on overall HCE was assessed.; RESULTS: IVD costs account for 2.3% and 1.4% of total HCE in the US and Germany. Most physicians (81%) believed that the actual HCE on IVDs was >5%; 19% rated the spending correctly (0-4%, p<0.001). When informed of the actual amount, 64% of physicians rated this as appropriate (p<0.0001); 66% of decision-making was based on IVD. Significantly, more physicians asked for either additional clinical or combined clinical/health economic data than for the product (test/platform) alone (p<0.0001).; CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a poor awareness of actual HCE on IVD, but a high attributable value of diagnostic procedures for patient management. New markers should deliver actionable and medically relevant information, to guide decision-making and foster improved patient outcomes.

AB Electronic medical records and clinical information systems are increasingly used in hospitals and can be leveraged to improve recognition and care for acute kidney injury. This Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup was convened to develop consensus around principles for the design of automated AKI detection systems to produce real-time AKI alerts using electronic systems. AKI alerts were recognized by the workgroup as an opportunity to prompt earlier clinical evaluation, further testing and ultimately intervention, rather than as a diagnostic label. Workgroup members agreed with designing AKI alert systems to align with the existing KDIGO classification system, but recommended future work to further refine the appropriateness of AKI alerts and to link these alerts to actionable recommendations for AKI care. The consensus statements developed in this review can be used as a roadmap for development of future electronic applications for automated detection and reporting of AKI.

AB A causal relationship between controlled substances and firearm violence has been widely assumed in the United States, and federal law prohibits individuals who are "unlawful users of or addicted to any controlled substance" from purchasing or possessing firearms (68 FR 3750. 2003. Codified at 27 CFR 478.11). However, the law does a poor job of defining "unlawful users," resulting in recent calls for a revised, actionable definition. Such a definition should be informed by research evidence, but to date the epidemiologic research on the relationship between controlled substances and violence has not been comprehensively reviewed. The initial goal of this review was to summarize the best available evidence on the relationship between controlled substances and firearm violence, but only 1 study specific to firearm violence was identified. We therefore reviewed studies of this relationship using broader measures of interpersonal violence and suicide, all of which included but were not limited to firearm violence, and measures of illicit firearm carrying. Prospective longitudinal studies (n = 22) from 1990 to 2014 were identified by using searches of online databases and citation tracking. Information was extracted from each study by using a standardized protocol. Quality of evidence was independently assessed by 2 reviewers. Aggregate measures of controlled substance use were associated with increased interpersonal violence and suicide, but evidence regarding the relationship between specific substances and violence was mixed. Involvement in illegal drug sales was consistently associated with interpersonal violence. To effectively revise extant federal law and delineate appropriate prohibiting criteria, more research is needed to understand the relationship between controlled substances and firearm violence.  © The Author 2016.

AB ABSTRACT: One of the goals of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) is to provide clear, evidence-based recommendations in our clinical practice guidelines. Periodically, the AASM will assess and update the process by which these guidelines are developed so that it is in line with the standards currently being used for guideline development. The AASM is now taking the next step forward by fully adopting GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) as the methodology used for evaluating evidence and forming clinical practice guidelines recommendations. Starting this year, AASM recommendations will be based on the following four interdependent domains: 1. quality of evidence; 2. balance of desirable and undesirable consequences; 3. patients' values and preferences; and 4. resource use (when known). AASM strengths of recommendations will be dichotomized into two categories: "Strong" and "Weak," either for or against a patient-care strategy. In an effort to provide clarity and transparency, all AASM recommendations will be actionable statements that include the specific patient population for which the patient-care strategy is recommended, and clearly define the comparator against which the patient-care strategy was evaluated. In some recommendations, the comparator will be an alternative patient-care strategy (e.g., a "gold standard" or previously available alternative), while in other recommendations the comparator will be a placebo or no treatment; this is determined by the availability of evidence, and analyses decisions made by the AASM task force. Implementation of the complete GRADE criteria by the AASM allows us the best path forward towards continuing to provide high quality clinical practice guidelines. © 2016 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

AB UNLABELLED: For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), identification of activating mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) has led to the development of several FLT3-inhibitors. Here we present clinical and next generation sequencing data at the time of progression of a patient on a novel FLT3-inhibitor clinical trial (ASP2215) to show that employing therapeutic interventions with these novel targeted therapies can lead to consequences secondary to selective pressure and clonal evolution of cancer.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of genotyping pancreatic tumors via fine needle aspirates (FNAs).; BACKGROUND: FNA is a common method of diagnosis for pancreatic cancer, yet it has traditionally been considered inadequate for molecular studies due to the limited quantity of DNA derived from FNA specimens and tumor heterogeneity.; METHODS: In vitro mixing studies were performed to deduce the minimum cellularity needed for genetic analysis. DNA from both simulated FNAs and clinical FNAs was sequenced. Mutational concordance was determined between simulated FNAs and that of the resected specimen.; RESULTS: Limiting dilution studies indicated that mutations present at allele frequencies as low as 0.12% are detectable. Comparison of simulated FNAs and matched tumor tissue exhibited a concordance frequency of 100% for all driver genes present. In FNAs obtained from 17 patients with unresectable disease, we identified at least 1 driver gene mutation in all patients including actionable somatic mutations in ATM and MTOR. The constellation of mutations identified in these patients was different than that reported for resectable pancreatic cancers, implying a biologic basis for presentation with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.; CONCLUSIONS: FNA sequencing is feasible and subsets of patients may harbor actionable mutations that could potentially impact therapy. Moreover, preoperative FNA sequencing has the potential to influence the timing of surgery relative to systemic therapy. FNA sequencing opens the door to clinical trials in which patients undergo neoadjuvant or a surgery-first approach based on their tumor genetics with the goal of utilizing cancer genomics in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer.

AB In laboratory medicine, the terms "standardization" and "harmonization" are frequently used interchangeably as the final goal is the same: the equivalence of measurement results among different routine measurement procedures over time and space according to defined analytical and clinical quality specifications. However, the terms define two distinct, albeit closely linked, concepts based on traceability principles. The word "standardization" is used when results for a measurement are equivalent and traceable to the International System of Units (SI) through a high-order primary reference material and/or a reference measurement procedure (RMP). "Harmonization" is generally used when results are equivalent, but neither a high-order primary reference material nor a reference measurement procedure is available. Harmonization is a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of accurate and actionable laboratory information. Patients, clinicians and other healthcare professionals assume that clinical laboratory tests performed by different laboratories at different times on the same sample and specimen can be compared, and that results can be reliably and consistently interpreted. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case, because many laboratory test results are still highly variable and poorly standardized and harmonized. Although the initial focus was mainly on harmonizing and standardizing analytical processes and methods, the scope of harmonization now also includes all other aspects of the total testing process (TTP), such as terminology and units, report formats, reference intervals and decision limits as well as tests and test profiles, requests and criteria for interpretation. Several projects and initiatives aiming to improve standardization and harmonization in the testing process are now underway. Laboratory professionals should therefore step up their efforts to provide interchangeable and comparable laboratory information in order to ultimately assure better diagnosis and treatment in patient care.

AB INTRODUCTION: The conventional one-drug-one-target-one-disease drug discovery process has been less successful in tracking multi-genic, multi-faceted complex diseases. Systems pharmacology has emerged as a new discipline to tackle the current challenges in drug discovery. The goal of systems pharmacology is to transform huge, heterogeneous, and dynamic biological and clinical data into interpretable and actionable mechanistic models for decision making in drug discovery and patient treatment. Thus, big data technology and data science will play an essential role in systems pharmacology.; AREAS COVERED: This paper critically reviews the impact of three fundamental concepts of data science on systems pharmacology: similarity inference, overfitting avoidance, and disentangling causality from correlation. The authors then discuss recent advances and future directions in applying the three concepts of data science to drug discovery, with a focus on proteome-wide context-specific quantitative drug target deconvolution and personalized adverse drug reaction prediction.; EXPERT OPINION: Data science will facilitate reducing the complexity of systems pharmacology modeling, detecting hidden correlations between complex data sets, and distinguishing causation from correlation. The power of data science can only be fully realized when integrated with mechanism-based multi-scale modeling that explicitly takes into account the hierarchical organization of biological systems from nucleic acid to proteins, to molecular interaction networks, to cells, to tissues, to patients, and to populations.

AB Molecular screening has become a standard of care for patients with advanced cancers and impacts on how to treat a patient. Advances in genomic technologies with the development of high throughput sequencing methods will certainly improve the possibilities to access a more accurate molecular diagnosis and to go beyond the identification of validated targets as a large number of genes can be screened for actionable changes. Moreover, accurate high throughput testing may help tumor classification in terms of prognosis and drug sensitivity. Finally, it will be possible to assess tumor heterogeneity and changes in molecular profiles during follow-up using ultra-deep sequencing technologies and circulating tumor DNA characterization. The accumulation of somatic ADN alterations is considered as the main contributing factor in carcinogenesis. The alterations can occur at different levels: mutation, copy number variations or gene translocations resulting in altered expression of the corresponding genes or impaired protein functions. Genes involved are mainly tumor suppressors, oncogenes or ADN repair genes whose modifications in tumors will impinge cell fate and proliferation from tumor initiation to metastasis. The entire genome of various tumor types, have now been sequenced. In lung cancer, the average number of mutations is very high with more than 8.9 mutations/Mb (Network TCGAR, 2014) that is to say more than 10,000 mutations/genome. These alterations need to be classified, indeed, some are true drivers that directly impact proliferation and some are passenger mutations linked to genetic instability. The development of targeted therapies relies on the identification of oncogenic drivers. The identification of genotype-phenotype associations as in the case of EGFR-TKI (Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and EGFR mutations in lung cancer led to the restriction of drugs to patients for which tumor genotype predicts efficacy. Tumor-molecular directed therapy based on validated targets (EGFR, ALK) is in the clinics, rapidly, with the developments of multi-targets or multi-drug assays there will be a need for tumor-molecular-profile directed therapy. Today, there are practical challenges to a successful implementation of NGS technologies for clinical applications. Broadly, some are linked to the tumor (heterogeneity), to the tissue (availability, storage, fixative), to the design of specific assays or set of genes, to the interpretation of non-driver mutations and to a possible access to drugs once a target is identified. Technical challenges are solved, NGS (at least targeted-NGS) plateforms have been validated by INCa labeled laboratories, in this context, we will address different questions: How, for whom, what kind of profiling and what can we expect?

AB Breast cancer is a multifaceted disease exhibiting both intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity as well as variable disease course. Over 2 decades of research has advanced the understanding of the molecular substructure of breast cancer, directing the development of new therapeutic strategies against these actionable targets. In vitro diagnostics, and specifically companion diagnostics, have been integral in the successful development and implementation of these targeted therapies, such as those directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Lately, there has been a surge in the development, commercialization, and marketing of diagnostic assays to assist in breast cancer patient care. More recently, multigene signature assays, such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, and Prosigna, have been integrated in the clinical setting in order to tailor decisions on adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy treatment. This review provides an overview of the current state of breast cancer management and the use of companion diagnostics to direct personalized approaches in the treatment of breast cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes affect a person's response to drugs. This descriptive study assessed whether popular drug information resources provide clinically useful pharmacogenomic (PGx) information.; METHODS: Four resources (package inserts, Lexicomp, Micromedex 2.0, and Epocrates) were evaluated for information about twenty-seven drugs.; RESULTS: There was wide variability of PGx information. Whereas Lexicomp included relevant PGx biomarker information for all 27 drugs, Epocrates did in less than 50% of the drugs. None of the resources had monographs that fully incorporated Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recommendations in more than 30% of the drugs.; CONCLUSION: Lexicomp appears to be most useful PGx drug information resource, but none of the resources are sufficient.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate the features of undiagnosed breast cancers on prior screening breast magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients who were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as the potential utility of MR-computer-aided evaluation (CAE).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2004 and May 2013, of the 72 consecutive pairs of prior negative MR images and subsequent MR images with diagnosed cancers (median interval, 32.8 months; range, 5.4-104.6 months), 36 (50%) had visible findings (mean size, 1.0 cm; range, 0.3-5.2 cm). The visible findings were divided into either actionable or underthreshold groups by the blinded review by 5 radiologists. MR imaging features, reasons for missed cancer, and MR-CAE features according to actionability were evaluated.; RESULTS: Of the 36 visible findings on prior MR images, 33.3% (12 of 36) of the lesions were determined to be actionable and 66.7% (24 of 36) were underthreshold; 85.7% (6 of 7) of masses and 31.6% (6 of 19) of non-mass enhancements were classified as actionable lesions. Mimicking physiologic enhancements (27.8%, 10 of 36) and small lesion size (27.8%, 10 of 36) were the most common reasons for missed cancer. Actionable findings tended to show more washout or plateau kinetic patterns on MR-CAE than underthreshold findings, as the 100% of actionable findings and 46.7% of underthreshold findings showed washout or plateau (p = 0.008).; CONCLUSION: MR-CAE has the potential for reducing the number of undiagnosed breast cancers on screening breast MR images, the majority of which are caused by mimicking physiologic enhancements or small lesion size.

AB Molecular profiling of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has a strong impact on clinical decision making and current oncological therapies. Besides detection of activating mutations in EGFR, analysis of ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements has come into focus for targeted therapies. Targeted massive parallel sequencing (MPS) has been established for routine diagnostic profiling of the most prevalent oncogenic mutations in NSCLC, but not for the detection of gene rearrangements yet. Here, we present and evaluate an MPS-based panel sequencing approach which simultaneously detects ALK, ROS1, and RET fusions as well as somatic mutations in a single multiplex assay using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. To this end, we first evaluated sensitivity and specificity of the fusion assay retrospectively by employing it to a set of 50 NSCLC with known gene fusions (n = 35) and with no gene fusions (n = 15). The sensitivity and specificity of the MPS assay for the detection of known fusions was 100%. In a second prospective phase, we implemented the approach of parallel mutation and gene fusion detection in our routine diagnostic workflow to assess performance of the test in a diagnostic outreach setting. Our prospective screening of 109 NSCLC samples revealed four gene fusions all of which were confirmed by FISH. In conclusion, our approach facilitates simultaneous high-throughput detection of gene fusions and somatic mutations in NSCLC samples and is able to replace conventional methods. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The purpose of this study is to identify patterns of narrative student feedback that are associated with relatively higher and lower evaluation scores.; METHODS: All student evaluations from our core radiology elective during 1 year were compiled. All evaluation comments were tagged, to identify discrete descriptive concepts. Correlation coefficients were calculated, for each tag with mean evaluation scores. Tags that were the most strongly associated with the highest- versus lowest-rated (> or < 1 SD) lectures were identified.; RESULTS: A total of 3,262 comments, on 273 lectures, rated by 77 senior medical students, were analyzed. The mean lecture score was 8.96 ± 0.62. Three tags were significantly positively correlated with lecture score: "interactive"; "fun/engaging"; and "practical/important content" (r = 0.39, r = 0.34, and r = 0.32, respectively; all P < .001). More tags (n = 12) were significantly negatively correlated with score; the three tags with the strongest such correlation were: "not interactive"; "poorly structured or unevenly paced"; and "content too detailed or abundant" (r = -0.44, r = -0.39, and r = -0.36, respectively; all P < .001). Analysis of only the highest- and lowest-rated lectures yielded similar results.; CONCLUSIONS: Several factors were identified that were strongly associated with lecture score. Among the actionable characteristics, interactive lectures with appropriately targeted content (ie, practical/useful) were the most highly rated. Copyright © 2016 American College of Radiology.

AB Nutritional research is entering a paradigm shift which necessitates the modeling of complex interactions between diet, genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. This requires the development of analytical and processing capabilities for multiple data and information sources to be able to improve targeted and personalized nutritional approaches for the maintenance of health. Ideally, such knowledge will be employed to underpin the development of concepts that combine consumer and medical nutrition with diagnostic targeting for early intervention designed to maintain proper metabolic homeostasis and delay the onset of chronic diseases. Nutritional status is fundamental to any description of health, and when combined with other data on lifestyle, environment, and genetics, it can be used to drive stratified or even personalized nutritional strategies for health maintenance and preventive medicine. In this work, we will discuss the importance of developing new nutrient assessment methods and diagnostic capabilities for nutritional status to generate scientific hypotheses and actionable concepts from which to develop targeted and eventually personalized nutritional solutions for health protection. We describe efforts to develop algorithms for dietary nutrient intake and a holistic nutritional profiling platform as the basis of understanding the complex nutrition and health interactome.  © 2016 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

AB Squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has always been characterized by a limited number of therapeutic options and by the lack of actionable biomarkers compared to its non-squamous counterpart. Recent clinical trials have led to the approval of new anti-neoplastic drugs available to both non-squamous and squamous NSCLC, consisting in a vascular-disrupting agent and two immune check-point inhibitors; additionally, a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is currently under evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While predictive molecular biomarkers have not been identified with consistency and are still highly demanded, these agents proved themselves noteworthy and can be considered a powerful addition to the available treatments for squamous NSCLC.

AB The prognosis of patients with metastatic cervical cancer is poor with a median survival of 8-13 months. Despite the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, this treatment is rarely curative and should be considered palliative only. In the last few years, a better understanding of Human papillomavirus tumor-host immune system interactions and the development of new therapeutics targeting immune check points have renewed interest in the use of immunotherapy in cervical cancer patients. Moreover, next generation sequencing has emerged as an attractive option for the identification of actionable driver mutations and other markers. In this review, we provide background information on the molecular biology of cervical cancer and summarize immunotherapy studies, targeted therapies, including those with angiogenesis inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors recently completed or currently on-going in cervical cancer patients.

AB OBJECTIVES: A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of implementing the Staphylococcus QuickFISH assay (AdvanDx, Woburn, MA), which rapidly detects and differentiates Staphylococcus aureus from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), together with an antimicrobial stewardship program on treating patients suspected of having sepsis.; METHODS: Two patient groups showing CoNS in positive blood cultures were evaluated by either conventional or QuickFISH testing with respect to turnaround time (TAT) for microorganism identification following Gram stain. Length of hospital stay (LOS) and days on the antibiotic vancomycin (DOV) were also compared.; RESULTS: QuickFISH identification test accuracy was 100% compared with conventional testing. Average values for TAT, LOS, and DOV were all decreased as the result of QuickFISH testing; for acute-care patients hospitalized for 10 days or less, the main population of interest for this study, these three measures were all reduced significantly following implementation of QuickFISH vs conventional testing (P <.001, P =.0484, and P =.0084, respectively). Based on certain assumptions, QuickFISH testing also led to substantial cost savings.; CONCLUSIONS: The QuickFISH assay, with its ability to provide timely and actionable results nearly simultaneously with the Gram stain, in conjunction with an effective antimicrobial stewardship program, has been adopted as standard of care at our community-based hospital. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

AB We evaluated the clinical utility of screening for mutations in 34 breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in high-risk families in Israel. Participants were recruited from 12, 2012 to 6, 2015 from 8 medical centers. All participants had high breast/ovarian cancer risk based on personal and family history. Genotyping was performed with the InVitae platform. The study was approved by the ethics committees of the participating centers; all participants gave a written informed consent before entering the study. Overall, 282 individuals participated in the study: 149 (53%) of Ashkenazi descent, 80 (28%) Jewish non-Ashkenazi descent, 22 (8%) of mixed Ashkenazi/non-Ashkenazi origin, 21 (7%) were non-Jewish Caucasians, and the remaining patients (n=10-3.5%) were of Christian Arabs/Druze/unknown ethnicity. For breast cancer patients (n=165), the median (range) age at diagnosis was 46 (22-90) years and for ovarian cancer (n=15) 54 (38-69) years. Overall, 30 cases (10.6%) were found to carry a pathogenic actionable mutation in the tested genes: 10 BRCA1 (3 non-founder mutations), 9 BRCA2 (8 non-founder mutations), and one each in the RAD51C and CHEK2 genes. Furthermore, actionable mutations were detected in 9 more cases in 4 additional genes (MSH2, RET, MSH6, and APC). No pathogenic mutations were detected in the other genotyped genes. In this high-risk population, 10.6% harbored an actionable pathogenic mutation, including non-founder mutations in BRCA1/2 and in additional cancer susceptibility genes, suggesting that high-risk families should be genotyped and be assigned a genotype-based cancer risk.

AB Neuroblastoma is an embryonal malignancy that commonly affects young children and is remarkably heterogenous in its malignant potential. Recently, the genetic basis of neuroblastoma has come into focus and not only has catalyzed a more comprehensive understanding of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis but also has revealed novel oncogenic vulnerabilities that are being therapeutically leveraged. Neuroblastoma is a model pediatric solid tumor in its use of recurrent genomic alterations, such as high-level MYCN (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma-derived homolog) amplification, for risk stratification. Given the relative paucity of recurrent, activating, somatic point mutations or gene fusions in primary neuroblastoma tumors studied at initial diagnosis, innovative treatment approaches beyond small molecules targeting mutated or dysregulated kinases will be required moving forward to achieve noticeable improvements in overall patient survival. However, the clonally acquired, oncogenic aberrations in relapsed neuroblastomas are currently being defined and may offer an opportunity to improve patient outcomes with molecularly targeted therapy directed toward aberrantly regulated pathways in relapsed disease. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about neuroblastoma genetics and genomics, highlighting the improved prognostication and potential therapeutic opportunities that have arisen from recent advances in understanding germline predisposition, recurrent segmental chromosomal alterations, somatic point mutations and translocations, and clonal evolution in relapsed neuroblastoma. © 2015 American Cancer Society.

AB The amount of genomic information about leukemia cells currently far exceeds our overall understanding of the precise genetic events that ultimately drive disease development and progression. Effective implementation of personalized medicine will require tools to distinguish actionable genetic alterations within the complex genetic landscape of leukemia. In this study, we performed kinase inhibitor screens to predict functional gene targets in primary specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Deep sequencing of the same patient specimens identified genetic alterations that were then integrated with the functionally important targets using the HitWalker algorithm to prioritize the mutant genes that most likely explain the observed drug sensitivity patterns. Through this process, we identified tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2 (TNK2) point mutations that exhibited oncogenic capacity. Importantly, the integration of functional and genomic data using HitWalker allowed for prioritization of rare oncogenic mutations that may have been missed through genomic analysis alone. These mutations were sensitive to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, which antagonizes TNK2 kinase activity, as well as novel TNK2 inhibitors, XMD8-87 and XMD16-5, with greater target specificity. We also identified activating truncation mutations in other tumor types that were sensitive to XMD8-87 and XMD16-5, exemplifying the potential utility of these compounds across tumor types dependent on TNK2. Collectively, our findings highlight a more sensitive approach for identifying actionable genomic lesions that may be infrequently mutated or overlooked and provide a new method for the prioritization of candidate genetic mutations. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Incidental findings are inevitable as clinical research and practice transitions from a single gene approach to a genomic approach. A novel deletion of the Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene was identified in a 22 year old male who underwent a molecular karyotype as part of an autism spectrum disorder research project. This unexpected result implies a predisposition to Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC), a rare, autosomal dominant condition and has unforeseen implications for him and his family. We review the typical features and management of HLRCC and discuss the challenges that face health professionals, as genetic testing advances and becomes more accessible.

We consider as well the broad range of social conditions that render genetic knowledge salient in clinical settings and for population health. This sociological analysis of genetic knowledge highlights how genetic knowledge flourishes and shapes social environments and how in turn environments select for particular forms of genetic knowledge. We examine the role of the laboratory, regulatory state, and social movements in the production of genetic knowledge and the clinic, family, and population health as critical sites where genetic knowledge becomes actionable.  © The Author(s) 2015.

AB Risk assessments and risk management efforts to protect human health and the environment can benefit from early, coordinated research planning by researchers, risk assessors, and risk managers. However, approaches for engaging these and other stakeholders in research planning have not received much attention in the environmental scientific literature. The Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA) approach under development by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is a means to manage complex information and input from diverse stakeholder perspectives on research planning that will ultimately support environmental and human health decision making. The objectives of this article are to 1) describe the outcomes of applying lessons learned from previous CEA applications to planning research on engineered nanomaterial, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and 2) discuss new insights and refinements for future efforts to engage stakeholders in research planning for risk assessment and risk management of environmental issues. Although framed in terms of MWCNTs, this discussion is intended to enhance research planning to support assessments for other environmental issues as well. Key insights for research planning include the potential benefits of 1) ensuring that participants have research, risk assessment, and risk management expertise in addition to diverse disciplinary backgrounds; 2) including an early scoping step before rounds of formal ratings; 3) using a familiar numeric scale (e.g., US dollars) versus ordinal rating scales of "importance"; 4) applying virtual communication tools to supplement face-to-face interaction between participants; and 5) refining criteria to guide development of specific, actionable research questions. © 2015 SETAC.

AB Rapid detection of blaKPC-containing organisms can significantly impact infection control and clinical practices, as well as therapeutic choices. Current molecular and phenotypic methods to detect these organisms, however, require additional testing beyond routine organism identification. In this study, we evaluated the clinical performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to detect pKpQIL_p019 (p019)-an 11,109-Da protein associated with certain blaKPC-containing plasmids that was previously shown to successfully track a clonal outbreak of blaKPC-pKpQIL-Klebsiella pneumoniae in a proof-of-principle study (A. F. Lau, H. Wang, R. A. Weingarten, S. K. Drake, A. F. Suffredini, M. K. Garfield, Y. Chen, M. Gucek, J. H. Youn, F. Stock, H. Tso, J. DeLeo, J. J. Cimino, K. M. Frank, and J. P. Dekker, J Clin Microbiol 52:2804-2812, 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00694-14). PCR for the p019 gene was used as the reference method. Here, blind analysis of 140 characterized Enterobacteriaceae isolates using two protein extraction methods (plate extraction and tube extraction) and two peak detection methods (manual and automated) showed sensitivities and specificities ranging from 96% to 100% and from 95% to 100%, respectively (2,520 spectra analyzed). Feasible laboratory implementation methods (plate extraction and automated analysis) demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity. All p019-positive isolates (n = 26) contained blaKPC and were carbapenem resistant. Retrospective analysis of an additional 720 clinical Enterobacteriaceae spectra found an 11,109-Da signal in nine spectra (1.3%), including seven from p019-containing, carbapenem-resistant isolates (positive predictive value [PPV], 78%). Instrument tuning had a significant effect on assay sensitivity, highlighting important factors that must be considered as MALDI-TOF MS moves into applications beyond microbial identification. Using a large blind clinical data set, we have shown that spectra acquired for routine organism identification can also be analyzed automatically in real time at high throughput, at no additional expense to the laboratory, to enable rapid detection of potentially blaKPC-containing carbapenem-resistant isolates, providing early and clinically actionable results.

AB Ethnic and geographic differences in cancer incidence, prognosis, and treatment outcomes can be attributed to diversity in the inherited (germline) and somatic genome. Although international large-scale sequencing efforts are beginning to unravel the genomic underpinnings of cancer traits, much remains to be known about the underlying mechanisms and determinants of genomic diversity. Carcinogenesis is a dynamic, complex phenomenon representing the interplay between genetic and environmental factors that results in divergent phenotypes across ethnicities and geography. For example, compared with whites, there is a higher incidence of prostate cancer among Africans and African Americans, and the disease is generally more aggressive and fatal. Genome-wide association studies have identified germline susceptibility loci that may account for differences between the African and non-African patients, but the lack of availability of appropriate cohorts for replication studies and the incomplete understanding of genomic architecture across populations pose major limitations. We further discuss the transformative potential of routine diagnostic evaluation for actionable somatic alterations, using lung cancer as an example, highlighting implications of population disparities, current hurdles in implementation, and the far-reaching potential of clinical genomics in enhancing cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. As we enter the era of precision cancer medicine, a concerted multinational effort is key to addressing population and genomic diversity as well as overcoming barriers and geographical disparities in research and health care delivery.  © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB BACKGROUND: Latinos, whose views are infrequently examined in genomic research, may be at risk of missing out on the benefits of genomic medicine.; AIMS: To explore this possibility, we conducted a qualitative study of awareness and attitudes about genetic testing among Latinos with lower acculturation in New York City.; METHODS: We conducted four focus groups (7 English-speaking men, 5 Spanish-speaking men, 13 English-speaking women and 13 Spanish-speaking women) to explore factors that influence the adoption of new innovations through the discussion of genetic testing in general, and a hypothetical vignette describing a genetic test for skin cancer risk, in particular.; RESULTS: Through inductive thematic text analysis of focus group transcripts, our multidisciplinary team identified themes within knowledge and attitudes, communication and sources of information, anticipated responses, factors that may increase adoption, and barriers to adoption of genetic testing. Specifically, a majority of participants expressed some degree of uncertainty regarding the purpose of genetic tests and information these tests provide, rarely discussed genetic testing with others in their social networks, and expressed concerns about the misuse of and possible adverse emotional responses to genetic information. However, participants also expressed high levels of interest in receiving a skin cancer genetic test in response to the vignette and believed that receiving actionable health information was a primary reason to consider testing. Gender-based differences in perceived barriers to testing emerged.; CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight beliefs and barriers that future interventions could target to help ensure that Latinos have adequate understanding of and access to genomic medicine advances. © 2015 S.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cancer quality registers are attracting increasing attention as important, but still underutilized sources of clinical data. To optimize the use of registers in quality assurance and improvement, data have to be rapidly collected, collated and presented as actionable, at-a-glance information to the reporting departments. This article presents a dashboard performance report on select quality indicators to cancer care providers.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten quality indicators registered on an individual patient level in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden and recommended by the National Prostate Cancer Guidelines were selected. Data reported to the National Prostate Cancer Register are uploaded within 24 h to the Information Network for Cancer Care platform. Launched in 2014, "What''s Going On, Prostate Cancer" provides rapid, at-a-glance performance feedback to care providers.; RESULTS: The indicators include time to report to the National Prostate Cancer Register, waiting times, designated clinical nurse specialist, multidisciplinary conference, adherence to guidelines for diagnostic work-up and treatment, and documentation and outcome of treatment. For each indicator, three performance levels were defined.; CONCLUSION: What's Going On, a dashboard performance report on 10 selected quality indicators to cancer care providers, provides an example of how data in cancer quality registers can be transformed into condensed, at-a-glance information to be used as actionable metrics for quality assurance and improvement.

AB Robust and analytically validated assays are essential for clinical studies. We outline an analytical validation study of a targeted next-generation sequencing mutation-detection assay used for patient selection in the National Cancer Institute Molecular Profiling-Based Assignment of Cancer Therapy (NCI-MPACT) trial (NCT01827384). Using DNA samples from normal or tumor cell lines and xenografts with known variants, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the NCI-MPACT assay in five variant types: single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), SNVs at homopolymeric (HP) regions (≥3 identical bases), small insertions/deletions (indels), large indels (gap≥4 bp), and indels at HP regions. The assay achieved sensitivities of 100% for 64 SNVs, nine SNVs at HP regions, and 11 large indels, 83.33% for six indels, and 93.33% for 15 indels at HP regions. Zero false positives (100% specificity) were found in 380 actionable mutation loci in 96 runs of haplotype map cells. Reproducibility analysis showed 96.3% to 100% intraoperator and 98.1% to 100% interoperator mean concordance in detected variants and 100% reproducibility in treatment selection. To date, 38 tumors have been screened, 34 passed preanalytical quality control, and 18 had actionable mutations for treatment assignment. The NCI-MPACT assay is well suited for its intended investigational use and can serve as a template for developing next-generation sequencing assays for other cancer clinical trial applications.

AB The evolution of personalised medicine in lung cancer has dramatically impacted diagnostic pathology. Current challenges centre on the growing demands placed on small tissue samples by molecular diagnostic techniques. In this review, expert recommendations are provided regarding successful identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Steps to correctly process and conserve tumour tissue during diagnostic testing are essential to ensure tissue availability. For example, storing extra tissue sections ready for molecular diagnostic steps allows faster testing and preserves tissue. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) is commonly used to detect ALK rearrangements, with most laboratories favouring screening by immunohistochemistry followed by a confirmatory FISH assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction can also identify ALK fusion gene mRNA transcripts but can be limited by the quality of RNA and the risk that rare fusion variants may not be captured. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has recently provided an alternative method for detecting ALK rearrangements. While current experience is limited, NGS is set to become the most efficient approach as an increasing number of genetic abnormalities is required to be tested. Upfront, reflex testing for ALK gene rearrangement should become routine as ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy moves into the first-line setting. Guidelines recommend that EGFR and ALK tests are carried out in parallel on all confirmed and potential adenocarcinomas, and this is more efficient in terms of tissue usage and testing turnaround time for both of these actionable gene alterations. The practice of sequential testing is not recommended. Identification of ALK rearrangements is now essential for the diagnosis of NSCLC, underpinned by the benefits of ALK inhibitors. As scientific understanding and diagnostic technology develops, ALK testing will continue to be an evolving and challenging paradigm. © The Author 2016.

AB MOTIVATION: Underrepresentation of racial groups represents an important challenge and major gap in phenomics research. Most of the current human phenomics research is based primarily on European populations; hence it is an important challenge to expand it to consider other population groups. One approach is to utilize data from EMR databases that contain patient data from diverse demographics and ancestries. The implications of this racial underrepresentation of data can be profound regarding effects on the healthcare delivery and actionability. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to perform comparative, population-scale analyses of disease networks across three different populations, namely Caucasian (EA), African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (HL).; RESULTS: We compared susceptibility profiles and temporal connectivity patterns for 1988 diseases and 37 282 disease pairs represented in a clinical population of 1 025 573 patients. Accordingly, we revealed appreciable differences in disease susceptibility, temporal patterns, network structure and underlying disease connections between EA, AA and HL populations. We found 2158 significantly comorbid diseases for the EA cohort, 3265 for AA and 672 for HL. We further outlined key disease pair associations unique to each population as well as categorical enrichments of these pairs. Finally, we identified 51key 'hub' diseases that are the focal points in the race-centric networks and of particular clinical importance. Incorporating race-specific disease comorbidity patterns will produce a more accurate and complete picture of the disease landscape overall and could support more precise understanding of disease relationships and patient management towards improved clinical outcomes.; CONTACTS: rong.chen@mssm.edu or joel.dudley@mssm.edu; SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. © The Author 2016.

AB The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to analyze the genomes of cancer cells has identified numerous genomic alterations, including single-base substitutions, small insertions and deletions, amplification, recombination, and epigenetic modifications. NGS contributes to the clinical management of patients as well as new discoveries that identify the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Moreover, analysis of gene panels targeting actionable mutations enhances efforts to optimize the selection of chemotherapeutic regimens. However, whole genome sequencing takes several days and costs at least $10,000, depending on sequence coverage. Therefore, laboratories with relatively limited resources must employ a more economical approach. For this purpose, we conducted an integrated nucleotide sequence analysis of a panel of 409-cancer related genes (409-CRG) combined with whole exome sequencing (WES). Analysis of the 409-CRG panel detected low-frequency variants with high sensitivity, and WES identified moderate and high frequency somatic variants as well as germline variants.

AB Activating mutations in tyrosine kinases (TKs) drive pediatric high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and confer resistance to standard chemotherapy. Therefore, there is urgent need to characterize dysregulated TK signaling axes in patients with ALL and identify actionable kinase targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the first study to quantitatively profile TK activity in xenografted patient biopsies of high-risk pediatric ALL. We integrated a quantitative phosphotyrosine profiling method with 'spike-in' stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and quantified 1394 class I phosphorylation sites in 16 ALL xenografts. Moreover, hierarchical clustering of phosphotyrosine sites could accurately classify these leukemias into either B or T-cell lineages with the high-risk early T-cell precursor (ETP) and Ph-like ALL clustering as a distinct group. Furthermore, we validated this approach by using specific kinase pathway inhibitors to perturb ABL1, FLT3, and JAK TK signaling in four xenografted patient samples. By quantitatively assessing the tyrosine phosphorylation status of activated kinases in xenograft models of ALL, we were able to identify and validate clinically relevant targets. Therefore, this study highlights the application and potential of phosphotyrosine profiling for identifying clinically relevant kinase targets in leukemia.

AB The RAS pathway is central to epidermal homeostasis, and its activation in tumors or in Rasopathies correlates with hyperproliferation. Downstream of RAS, RAF kinases are actionable targets regulating keratinocyte turnover; however, chemical RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate the pathway, promoting epidermal proliferation. We generated mice with compound epidermis-restricted BRAF/RAF1 ablation. In these animals, transient barrier defects and production of chemokines and Th2-type cytokines by keratinocytes cause a disease akin to human atopic dermatitis, characterized by IgE responses and local and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, BRAF and RAF1 operate independently to balance MAPK signaling: BRAF promotes ERK activation, while RAF1 dims stress kinase activation. In vivo, JNK inhibition prevents disease onset, while MEK/ERK inhibition in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 phenocopies it. These results support a primary role of keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the animals lacking BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis represent a useful model for this disease.

AB Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of international development programming is expected to produce "evidence-based" insight for both policy and practice. While supportive of evidence-based decision making, critics of contemporary M&E practice charge that it reflects the development industry's deepening audit culture, causing deleterious effects. I offer the example of a democratization program in postwar Angola to examine how the design and conduct of M&E in this case reinforced social boundaries and hierarchies of power among the program's own staff members. These professional staff hierarchies effectively barred ground-level evidence noted by implementation agents from being incorporated into the program's formal knowledge base. The case demonstrates that monitoring and evaluation procedures within development programs, and perhaps in other bureaucracies, must be examined for their social uses and effects among practitioners. These effects not only weaken the production of actionable knowledge for development but, by reinforcing social inequalities within the very industry tasked to combat them, also structurally threaten the endeavor.

AB BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) are information technology-based software that provide health professionals with actionable, patient-specific recommendations or guidelines for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management at the point-of-care. These messages are intelligently filtered to enhance the health and clinical care of patients. CDSSs may be integrated with patient electronic health records (EHRs) and evidence-based knowledge.; METHODS/DESIGN: We designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of patient-specific, evidence-based reminders generated at the point-of-care by a multi-specialty decision support system on clinical practice and the quality of care. We will include all the patients admitted to the internal medicine department of one large general hospital. The primary outcome is the rate at which medical problems, which are detected by the decision support software and reported through the reminders, are resolved (i.e., resolution rates). Secondary outcomes are resolution rates for reminders specific to venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, in-hospital all causes and VTE-related mortality, and the length of hospital stay during the study period.; DISCUSSION: The adoption of CDSSs is likely to increase across healthcare systems due to growing concerns about the quality of medical care and discrepancy between real and ideal practice, continuous demands for a meaningful use of health information technology, and the increasing use of and familiarity with advanced technology among new generations of physicians. The results of our study will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of CDSSs in primary care and hospital settings, thereby informing future research and healthcare policy questions related to the feasibility and value of CDSS use in healthcare systems. This trial is seconded by a specialty trial randomizing patients in an oncology setting (ONCO-CODES).; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02577198?term=NCT02577198&rank=1.

AB Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is the application of the next-generation technology to determine the variations in the exome and is becoming a standard approach in studying genetic variants in diseases. Understanding the exomes of individuals at single base resolution allows the identification of actionable mutations for disease treatment and management. WES technologies have shifted the bottleneck in experimental data production to computationally intensive informatics-based data analysis. Novel computational tools and methods have been developed to analyze and interpret WES data. Here, we review some of the current tools that are being used to analyze WES data. These tools range from the alignment of raw sequencing reads all the way to linking variants to actionable therapeutics. Strengths and weaknesses of each tool are discussed for the purpose of helping researchers make more informative decisions on selecting the best tools to analyze their WES data.

Black adolescents with mental illnesses in particular are a relatively underserved, hidden population in the field of sexual health. Strategies and guidelines are needed to account for underlying psychopathology among Black adolescents with mental illnesses in ways that current models have yet to address. In this paper, we propose several actionable mechanisms to better integrate HIV/STI and mental health related services and activities for sexual health promotion.

AB Precision medicine in oncology is the result of an increasing awareness of patient-specific clinical features coupled with the development of genomic-based diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. Companion diagnostics designed for specific drug-target pairs were the first to widely utilize clinically applicable tumor biomarkers (eg, HER2, EGFR), directing treatment for patients whose tumors exhibit a mutation susceptible to an FDA-approved targeted therapy (eg, trastuzumab, erlotinib). Clinically relevant germline mutations in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters (eg, TPMT, DPYD) have been shown to impact drug response, providing a rationale for individualized dosing to optimize treatment. The use of multigene expression-based assays to analyze an array of prognostic biomarkers has been shown to help direct treatment decisions, especially in breast cancer (eg, Oncotype DX). More recently, the use of next-generation sequencing to detect many potential "actionable" cancer molecular alterations is further shifting the 1 gene-1 drug paradigm toward a more comprehensive, multigene approach. Currently, many clinical trials (eg, NCI-MATCH, NCI-MPACT) are assessing novel diagnostic tools with a combination of different targeted therapeutics while also examining tumor biomarkers that were previously unexplored in a variety of cancer histologies. Results from ongoing trials such as the NCI-MATCH will help determine the clinical utility and future development of the precision-medicine approach. © 2016, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

AB Advances in genomic medicine have the potential to change the way we treat human disease, but translating these advances into reality for improving healthcare outcomes depends essentially on our ability to discover disease- and/or drug-associated clinically actionable genetic mutations. Integration and manipulation of diverse genomic data and comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs) on a big data infrastructure can provide an efficient and effective way to identify clinically actionable genetic variants for personalized treatments and reduce healthcare costs. We review bioinformatics processing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, bioinformatics infrastructures for implementing precision medicine, and bioinformatics approaches for identifying clinically actionable genetic variants using high-throughput NGS data and EHRs.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of these devices on management of pediatric patients with known or suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes.; METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all pediatric patients with known or suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes in whom an ILR was implanted from 2008 to 2015. Captured data included categorization of diagnosis, treatment, transmitted tracings, and the impact of ILR tracings on management. Transmissions were categorized as symptomatic, autotriggered, or routine. Actionable transmissions were abnormal tracings that directly resulted in a change of medical or device therapy. A total of 20 patients met the stated inclusion criteria (long QT syndrome, n=8, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,n=9, Brugada syndrome, n=1, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, n=2), with 60% of patients being genotype positive. Primary indication for implantation of ILR included ongoing monitoring +/- symptoms (n=15, 75%), suspicion of noncompliance (n=1, 5%), and liberalization of recommended activity restrictions (n=4, 25%). A total of 172 transmissions were received in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes, with 7% yielding actionable data. The majority (52%) of symptom events were documented in the long QT syndrome population, with only 1 tracing (5%) yielding actionable data. Automatic transmissions were mostly seen in the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cohort (81%), with 21% yielding actionable data. There was no actionable data in routine transmissions.; CONCLUSIONS: ILRs in patients with suspected or confirmed inherited arrhythmia syndromes may be useful for guiding management. Findings escalated therapies in 30% of subjects. As importantly, in this high-risk population, the majority of symptom events represented normal or benign rhythms, reassuring patients and physicians that no further intervention was required. © 2016 The Authors.

AB In metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), actionable genetic lesions represent potential clinical opportunities. NTRK1, 2, and 3 gene rearrangements encode oncogenic fusions of the tropomyosin-receptor kinase (TRK) family of receptor tyrosine kinases in different tumor types. The TPM3-NTRK1 rearrangement is a recurring event in CRC that renders tumors sensitive to TRKA kinase inhibitors in preclinical models. We identified abnormal expression of the TRKA protein in tumor and liver metastases of a CRC patient refractory to standard therapy. Molecular characterization unveiled a novel LMNA-NTRK1 rearrangement within chromosome 1 with oncogenic potential, and the patient was treated with the pan-TRK inhibitor entrectinib, achieving partial response with decrease in hepatic target lesions from 6.8 and 8.2cm in longest diameter to 4.7 and 4.3cm, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical evidence of efficacy for therapeutic inhibition of TRKA in a solid tumor, illuminating a genomic-driven strategy to identify CRCs reliant on this oncogene to be clinically targeted with entrectinib. © The Author 2015.

AB As our understanding of the driver mutations necessary for initiation and progression of cancers improves, we gain critical information on how specific molecular profiles of a tumor may predict responsiveness to therapeutic agents or provide knowledge about prognosis. At our institution a tumor genotyping program was established as part of routine clinical care, screening both hematologic and solid tumors for a wide spectrum of mutations using two next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels: a custom, 33 gene hematological malignancies panel for use with peripheral blood and bone marrow, and a commercially produced solid tumor panel for use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue that targets 47 genes commonly mutated in cancer. Our workflow includes a pathologist review of the biopsy to ensure there is adequate amount of tumor for the assay followed by customized DNA extraction is performed on the specimen. Quality control of the specimen includes steps for quantity, quality and integrity and only after the extracted DNA passes these metrics an amplicon library is generated and sequenced. The resulting data is analyzed through an in-house bioinformatics pipeline and the variants are reviewed and interpreted for pathogenicity. Here we provide a snapshot of the utility of each panel using two clinical cases to provide insight into how a well-designed NGS workflow can contribute to optimizing clinical outcomes.

AB Proposals to improve the reproducibility of biomedical research have emphasized scientific rigor. Although the word "rigor" is widely used, there has been little specific discussion as to what it means and how it can be achieved. We suggest that scientific rigor combines elements of mathematics, logic, philosophy, and ethics. We propose a framework for rigor that includes redundant experimental design, sound statistical analysis, recognition of error, avoidance of logical fallacies, and intellectual honesty. These elements lead to five actionable recommendations for research education. Copyright © 2016 Casadevall and Fang.

AB The American Academy of Microbiology convened a colloquium to discuss problems in the biological sciences, with emphasis on identifying mechanisms to improve the quality of research. Participants from various disciplines made six recommendations: (i) design rigorous and comprehensive evaluation criteria to recognize and reward high-quality scientific research; (ii) require universal training in good scientific practices, appropriate statistical usage, and responsible research practices for scientists at all levels, with training content regularly updated and presented by qualified scientists; (iii) establish open data at the timing of publication as the standard operating procedure throughout the scientific enterprise; (iv) encourage scientific journals to publish negative data that meet methodologic standards of quality; (v) agree upon common criteria among scientific journals for retraction of published papers, to provide consistency and transparency; and (vi) strengthen research integrity oversight and training. These recommendations constitute an actionable framework that, in combination, could improve the quality of biological research. Copyright © 2016 Casadevall et al.

AB Translating the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technology into medical microbiology requires on-going analysis that keeps pace with technological improvements to the instrument and release of associated analysis software. Here, we use a multidrug-resistant Enterobacter kobei isolate as a model organism to compare open source software for the assembly of genome data, and relate this to the time taken to generate actionable information. Three software tools (PBcR, Canu and miniasm) were used to assemble MinION data and a fourth (SPAdes) was used to combine MinION and Illumina data to produce a hybrid assembly. All four had a similar number of contigs and were more contiguous than the assembly using Illumina data alone, with SPAdes producing a single chromosomal contig. Evaluation of the four assemblies to represent the genome structure revealed a single large inversion in the SPAdes assembly, which also incorrectly integrated a plasmid into the chromosomal contig. Almost 50%, 80% and 90% of MinION pass reads were generated in the first 6, 9 and 12 h, respectively. Using data from the first 6 h alone led to a less accurate, fragmented assembly, but data from the first 9 or 12 h generated similar assemblies to that from 48 h sequencing. Assemblies were generated in 2 h using Canu, indicating that going from isolate to assembled data is possible in less than 48 h. MinION data identified that genes responsible for resistance were carried by two plasmids encoding resistance to carbapenem and to sulphonamides, rifampicin and aminoglycosides, respectively.

AB Forensic science concerns the application of scientific techniques to questions of a legal nature and may also be used to address questions of historical importance. Forensic techniques are often used in legal cases that involve crimes against persons or property, and they increasingly may involve cases of bioterrorism, crimes against nature, medical negligence, or tracing the origin of food- and crop-borne disease. Given the rapid advance of genome sequencing and comparative genomics techniques, we ask how these might be used to address cases of a forensic nature, focusing on the use of microbial genome sequence analysis. Such analyses rely on the increasingly large numbers of microbial genomes present in public databases, the ability of individual investigators to rapidly sequence whole microbial genomes, and an increasing depth of understanding of their evolution and function. Suggestions are made as to how comparative microbial genomics might be applied forensically and may represent possibilities for the future development of forensic techniques. A particular emphasis is on the nascent field of genomic epidemiology, which utilizes rapid whole-genome sequencing to identify the source and spread of infectious outbreaks. Also discussed is the application of comparative microbial genomics to the study of historical epidemics and deaths and how the approaches developed may also be applicable to more recent and actionable cases.

AB This article summarizes presentations from a 2014 United States Department of Defense (DoD) Health Affairs Women in Combat symposium addressing physiological, musculoskeletal injury, and optimized physical training considerations from the operational physical performance section. The symposium was held to provide a state-of-the-science meeting on the U.S. DoD's rescinding of the ground combat exclusion policy opening up combat-centric occupations to women. Physiological, metabolic, body composition, bone density, cardiorespiratory fitness, and thermoregulation differences between men and women were briefly reviewed. Injury epidemiological data are presented within military training and operational environments demonstrating women to be at a higher risk for musculoskeletal injuries than men. Physical training considerations for improved muscle strength and power, occupational task performance, load carriage were also reviewed. Particular focus of this article was given to translating physiological and epidemiological findings from the literature on these topics toward actionable guidance and policy recommendations for military leaders responsible for military physical training doctrine: (1) inclusion of resistance training with special emphasis on strength and power development (i.e., activation of high-threshold motor units and recruitment of type II high-force muscle fibers), upper-body strength development, and heavy load carriage, (2) moving away from "field expediency" as the major criteria for determining military physical training policy and training implementation, (3) improvement of load carriage ability with emphasis placed on specific load carriage task performance, combined with both resistance and endurance training, and (4) providing greater equipment resources, coaching assets, and increased training time dedicated to physical readiness training.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumor in adults. Identification of SMO and AKT1 mutations in meningiomas has raised the possibility of targeted therapies for some patients. The frequency of such mutations in clinical cohorts and the presence of other actionable mutations in meningiomas are important to define.; METHODS: We used high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization to prospectively characterize copy-number changes in 150 meningiomas and then characterized these samples for mutations in AKT1, KLF4, NF2, PIK3CA, SMO, and TRAF7.; RESULTS: Similar to prior reports, we identified AKT1 and SMO mutations in a subset of non-NF2-mutant meningiomas (ie, 9% and 6%, respectively). Notably, we detected oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA in 7% of non-NF2-mutant meningiomas. AKT1, SMO, and PIK3CA mutations were mutually exclusive. AKT1, KLF4, and PIK3CA mutations often co-occurred with mutations in TRAF7. PIK3CA-mutant meningiomas showed limited chromosomal instability and were enriched in the skull base.; CONCLUSION: This work identifies PI3K signaling as an important target for precision medicine trials in meningioma patients. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB BACKGROUND: Population-based screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a promising public health strategy to prevent stroke. However, none of the published reports have evaluated comprehensive screening for additional stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes in a pharmacy setting.; METHODS: The Program for the Identification of 'Actionable' Atrial Fibrillation in the Pharmacy Setting (PIAAF-Pharmacy) screened individuals aged ≥65 years, attending community pharmacies in Canada, who were not receiving oral anticoagulation (OAC). Participants were screened for AF using a hand-held ECG device, had blood pressure (BP) measured, and diabetes risk estimated using the Canadian Diabetes Risk Assessment Questionnaire (CANRISK) questionnaire. 'Actionable' AF was defined as unrecognised or undertreated AF. A 6-week follow-up visit with the family physician was suggested for participants with 'actionable' AF and a scheduled 3-month visit occurred at an AF clinic.; RESULTS: During 6 months, 1145 participants were screened at 30 pharmacies. 'Actionable' AF was identified in 2.5% (95% CI 1.7 to 3.6; n=29); of these, 96% were newly diagnosed. Participants with 'actionable AF' had a mean age of 77.2±6.8 years, 58.6% were male and 93.1% had a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2. A BP>140/90 was found in 54.9% (616/1122) of participants and 44.4% (214/492) were found to be at high risk of diabetes. At 3 months, only 17% of participants were started on OAC, 50% had improved BP and 71% had confirmatory diabetes testing.; CONCLUSIONS: Integrated stroke screening identifies a high prevalence of individuals who could benefit from stroke prevention therapies but must be coupled with a defined care pathway.

AB The practice of medicine is predicated on discovering commonalities or distinguishing characteristics among patients to inform corresponding treatment. Given a patient grouping (hereafter referred to as a phenotype), clinicians can implement a treatment pathway accounting for the underlying cause of disease in that phenotype. Traditionally, phenotypes have been discovered by intuition, experience in practice, and advancements in basic science, but these approaches are often heuristic, labor intensive, and can take decades to produce actionable knowledge. Although our understanding of disease has progressed substantially in the past century, there are still important domains in which our phenotypes are murky, such as in behavioral health or in hospital settings. To accelerate phenotype discovery, researchers have used machine learning to find patterns in electronic health records, but have often been thwarted by missing data, sparsity, and data heterogeneity. In this study, we use a flexible framework called Generalized Low Rank Modeling (GLRM) to overcome these barriers and discover phenotypes in two sources of patient data. First, we analyze data from the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS), which contains upwards of 8 million hospitalization records consisting of administrative codes and demographic information. Second, we analyze a small (N=1746), local dataset documenting the clinical progression of autism spectrum disorder patients using granular features from the electronic health record, including text from physician notes. We demonstrate that low rank modeling successfully captures known and putative phenotypes in these vastly different datasets.

AB We present a framework for developing a community health record to bring stakeholders, information, and technology together to collectively improve the health of a community. It is both social and technical in nature and presents an iterative and participatory process for achieving multisector collaboration and information sharing. It proposes a methodology and infrastructure for bringing multisector stakeholders and their information together to inform, target, monitor, and evaluate community health initiatives. The community health record is defined as both the proposed framework and a tool or system for integrating and transforming multisector data into actionable information. It is informed by the electronic health record, personal health record, and County Health Ranking systems but differs in its social complexity, communal ownership, and provision of information to multisector partners at scales ranging from address to zip code.

AB INTRODUCTION: Despite the first goal of the 2010 National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy, the literacy demands of much health information exceeds the reading skills of most US adults. The objective of this study was to assess the health literacy level of publicly available patient education materials for people with sickle cell disease (SCD).; METHODS: We used 5 validated tools to evaluate 9 print and 4 online patient education materials: the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG) to assess reading grade level, the Peter Mosenthal and Irwin Kirsch readability formula (PMOSE/IKIRSCH) to assess structure and density, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) to assess actionability (how well readers will know what to do after reading the material) and understandability, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Clear Communication Index (Index) to obtain a comprehensive literacy demand score, and the Printed Cancer Education Materials for African Americans Cultural Sensitivity Assessment Tool.; RESULTS: Materials' scores reflected high reading levels ranging from 8th grade to 12th grade, appropriate (low) structural demand, and low actionability relative to understandability. CDC suggests that an appropriate Index score should fall in or above the 90th percentile. The scores yielded by materials evaluated in this assessment ranged from the 44th to the 76th percentiles. Eight of the 13 materials scored within the acceptable range for cultural sensitivity.; CONCLUSION: Reading levels of available patient education materials exceed the documented average literacy level of the US adult population. Health literacy demands should be a key consideration in the revision and development of patient education materials for people with SCD.

AB OBJECTIVE: Prior to implementing a trial to evaluate the economic costs and clinical outcomes of pharmacogenetic testing in a large safety net health care system, we determined the number of patients taking targeted medications and their clinical care encounter sites.; METHODS: Using 1-year electronic medical record data, we evaluated the number of patients who had started one or more of 30 known pharmacogenomically actionable medications and the number of care encounter sites the patients had visited.; RESULTS: Results showed 7039 unique patients who started one or more of the target medications within a 12-month period with visits to 73 care sites within the system.; CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the type of large-scale, multi-drug, multi-gene approach to pharmacogenetic testing we are planning is widely relevant, and successful implementation will require wide-scale education of prescribers and other personnel involved in medication dispensing and handling.

AB INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the attitudes of faculty and residents toward the use of patient experience data as a tool for providing resident feedback. The purpose of this study was to explore the attitudes of teaching faculty surrounding patient experience data and how those attitudes may influence the feedback given to trainees.; METHODS: From July 2013 to August 2013, we conducted in-depth, face-to-face, semistructured interviews with 9 attending physicians who precept residents in internal medicine at 2 continuity clinics (75% of eligible attendings). Interviews were coded using conventional content analysis.; RESULTS: Content analysis identified six potential barriers in using patient experience survey data to provide feedback to residents: 1) perceived inability of residents to learn or to incorporate feedback, 2) punitive nature of feedback, 3) lack of training in the delivery of actionable feedback, 4) lack of timeliness in the delivery of feedback, 5) unclear benefit of patient experience survey data as a tool for providing resident feedback, and 6) lack of individualized feedback.; CONCLUSION: Programs may want to conduct an internal review on how patient experience data is incorporated into the resident feedback process and how, if at all, their faculty are trained to provide such feedback.

AB Recent genome-wide studies of malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS) have revolutionized our understanding of the biology of these tumors. This newly gained knowledge provides a wealth of opportunity for biomarker driven clinical research. To date, however, only few of the available molecular markers truly influence clinical decision-making and treatment. The most widely validated markers in neuro-oncology presently are: 1) MGMT promoter methylation as a prognostic and predictive marker in glioblastoma, 2) co-deletion of 1p and 19q differentiating oligodendrogliomas from astrocytomas, 3) IDH1/2 mutations, and 4) select pathway-associated mutations. This article focuses on currently impactful biomarkers in adult and pediatric brain cancers and it provides a perspective on the direction of research in this field.

AB BACKGROUND: Successful maturation of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) remains a challenge for those managing patients with end-stage renal disease. Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MR) can be used to evaluate AVFs without the risk of radiation exposure, intravenous contrast, or reliance on the operator-dependent modality of color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS). The objective of our study was to assess the utility of TOF-MR in the evaluation of nonmaturing AVFs and to identify the best clinical situations to use this technology.; METHODS: Consecutive patients with abnormal findings on CDUS or physical examination after AVF creation underwent 3-dimensional (3D) TOF-MR. Imaging was performed at 3 T with a scan acquisition time of approximately 15 min. The technique was similar to head and neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), except presaturation bands were not used, thereby allowing simultaneous visualization of both arterial and venous flow. A total of 19 TOF-MR studies were performed.; RESULTS: Nineteen patients underwent imaging and were the focus of this study. Seventeen of 19 TOF-MR studies were of diagnostic quality and yielded findings which enabled the vascular surgeon to take corrective measures. Findings included inflow stenosis, anastomotic narrowing, venous outflow stenosis, and hemodynamically significant venous tributaries. Twelve of 17 patients required conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The congruence rate between TOF-MR and DSA was 83.3%. Four patients (21%) avoided DSA and went directly to definitive surgical treatment including branch ligation (3) or new access (1).; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report in the literature of successful implementation of 3D TOF-MR to assist in identifying AVF maturation problems. This unique noninvasive imaging modality provides actionable images without contrast or radiation exposure and can obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures or provide an anatomic map for planning corrective intervention.

AB PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to describe a quality improvement process using failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to evaluate systems handoff communication processes, improve emergency department (ED) throughput and reduce crowding through development of a standardized handoff, and, ultimately, improve patient safety.; BACKGROUND: Risk of patient harm through ineffective communication during handoff transitions is a major reason for breakdown of systems. Complexities of ED processes put patient safety at risk.; RATIONALE: An increased incidence of submitted patient safety event reports for handoff communication failures between the ED and inpatient units solidified a decision to implement the use of FMEA to identify handoff failures to mitigate patient harm through redesign.; DESCRIPTION: The clinical nurse specialist implemented an FMEA. Handoff failure themes were created from deidentified retrospective reviews. Weekly meetings were held over a 3-month period to identify failure modes and determine cause and effect on the process. A functional block diagram process map tool was used to illustrate handoff processes. An FMEA grid was used to list failure modes and assign a risk priority number to quantify results.; OUTCOMES: Multiple areas with actionable failures were identified. A majority of causes for high-priority failure modes were specific to communications.; CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate the complexity of transition and handoff processes. The FMEA served to identify and evaluate risk of handoff failures and provide a framework for process improvement.; IMPLICATIONS: A focus on mentoring nurses to quality handoff processes so that it becomes habitual practice is crucial to safe patient transitions. Standardizing content and hardwiring within the system are best practice. The clinical nurse specialist is prepared to provide strong leadership to drive and implement system-wide quality projects.

AB Breast cancer screening has led to a dramatic increase in the detection of pre-invasive breast lesions. While mastectomy is almost guaranteed to treat the disease, more conservative approaches could be as effective if patients can be stratified based on risk of co-existing or recurrent invasive disease.Here we use a range of biomarkers to interrogate and classify purely non-invasive lesions (PNL) and those with co-existing invasive breast cancer (CEIN). Apart from Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), relative homogeneity is observed. DCIS contained a greater spread of molecular subtypes. Interestingly, high expression of p-mTOR was observed in all PNL with lower expression in DCIS and invasive carcinoma while the opposite expression pattern was observed for TOP2A.Comparing PNL with CEIN, we have identified p53 and Ki67 as predictors of CEIN with a combined PPV and NPV of 90.48% and 43.3% respectively. Furthermore, HER2 expression showed the best concordance between DCIS and its invasive counterpart.We propose that these biomarkers can be used to improve the management of patients with pre-invasive breast lesions following further validation and clinical trials. p53 and Ki67 could be used to stratify patients into low and high-risk groups for co-existing disease. Knowledge of expression of more actionable targets such as HER2 or TOP2A can be used to design chemoprevention or neo-adjuvant strategies. Increased knowledge of the molecular profile of pre-invasive lesions can only serve to enhance our understanding of the disease and, in the era of personalised medicine, bring us closer to improving breast cancer care.

AB Although breast cancer is the second most common cause of brain metastasis with a notable increase of incidence, genes that mediate breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) are not fully understood. To study the molecular nature of brain metastasis, we performed gene expression profiling of brain metastasis and matched primary breast cancer (BC). We used the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 covering 2,855 mutations from 50 cancer genes to analyze 18 primary BC and 42 BCBM including 15 matched pairs. The most common BCBM subtypes were triple-negative (42.9%) and basal-like (36.6%). In a total of 42 BCBM samples, 32 (76.2%) harbored at least one mutation (median 1, range 0-7 mutations). Frequently detected somatic mutations included TP53 (59.5%), MLH1 (14.3%), PIK3CA (14.3%), and KIT (7.1%). We compared BCBM with patient-matched primary BC specimens. There were no significant differences in mutation profiles between the two groups. Notably, gene expression in BCBM such as TP53, PIK3CA, KIT, MLH1, and RB1 also seemed to be present in primary breast cancers. The TP53 mutation frequency was higher in BCBM than in primary BC (59.5% vs 38.9%, respectively). In conclusion, we found actionable gene alterations in BCBM that were maintained in primary BC. Further studies with functional testing and a delineation of the role of these genes in specific steps of the metastatic process should lead to a better understanding of the biology of metastasis and its susceptibility to treatment.

AB Enabled by high-throughput sequencing approaches, epithelial cancers across a range of tissue types are seen to harbor gene fusions as integral to their landscape of somatic aberrations. Although many gene fusions are found at high frequency in several rare solid cancers, apart from fusions involving the ETS family of transcription factors which have been seen in approximately 50% of prostate cancers, several other common solid cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions at low frequencies. On the other hand, many gene fusions involving oncogenes, such as those encoding ALK, RAF or FGFR kinase families, have been detected across multiple different epithelial carcinomas. Tumor-specific gene fusions can serve as diagnostic biomarkers or help define molecular subtypes of tumors; for example, gene fusions involving oncogenes such as ERG, ETV1, TFE3, NUT, POU5F1, NFIB, PLAG1, and PAX8 are diagnostically useful. Tumors with fusions involving therapeutically targetable genes such as ALK, RET, BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1-4, and NOTCH1-3 have immediate implications for precision medicine across tissue types. Thus, ongoing cancer genomic and transcriptomic analyses for clinical sequencing need to delineate the landscape of gene fusions. Prioritization of potential oncogenic "drivers" from "passenger" fusions, and functional characterization of potentially actionable gene fusions across diverse tissue types, will help translate these findings into clinical applications. Here, we review recent advances in gene fusion discovery and the prospects for medicine.

AB The treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is slowly evolving from empirical cytotoxic chemotherapy to personalized treatment based on specific molecular alterations. Despite this 10-year evolution, targeted therapies have not been studied adequately in patients with resected NSCLC who have clearly defined actionable mutations. The advent of next-generation sequencing has now made it possible to characterize genomic alterations in unprecedented detail. The efforts begun by The Cancer Genome Atlas project to understand the complexities of the genomic landscape of lung cancer will be supplemented further by studying a large number of tumor specimens. The Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trial (ALCHEMIST) is an NCI-sponsored national clinical trials network (NCTN) initiative to address the needs to refine therapy for early-stage NSCLC. This program will screen several thousand patients with operable lung adenocarcinoma to determine whether their tumors contain specific molecular alterations [epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement (ALK)], making them eligible for treatment trials that target these alterations. Patients with EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement in their tumor will be randomized to placebo versus erlotinib or crizotinib, respectively, after completion of their standard adjuvant therapy. ALCHEMIST will also contain a large discovery component that will provide an opportunity to incorporate genomic studies to fully understand the clonal architecture, clonal evolution, and mechanisms of resistance to therapy. In this review, we describe the concept, rationale, and outline of ALCHEMIST and the plan for genomic studies in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

AB BACKGROUND: The core objective of any point-of-care (POC) testing program is to ensure that testing will result in an actionable management decision (e.g. referral, confirmatory test, treatment), within the same clinical encounter (e.g. POC continuum). This can but does not have to involve rapid tests. Most studies on POC testing focus on one specific test and disease in a particular healthcare setting. This paper describes the actors, technologies and practices involved in diagnosing major diseases in five Indian settings - the home, community, clinics, peripheral laboratories and hospitals. The aim was to understand how tests are used and fit into the health system and with what implications for the POC continuum.; METHODS: The paper reports on a qualitative study including 78 semi-structured interviews and 13 focus group discussions with doctors, nurses, patients, lab technicians, program officers and informal providers, conducted between January and June 2013 in rural and urban Karnataka, South India. Actors, diseases, tests and diagnostic processes were mapped for each of the five settings and analyzed with regard to whether and how POC continuums are being ensured.; RESULTS: Successful POC testing hardly occurs in any of the five settings. In hospitals and public clinics, most of the rapid tests are used in laboratories where either the single patient encounter advantage is not realized or the rapidity is compromised. Lab-based testing in a context of manpower and equipment shortages leads to delays. In smaller peripheral laboratories and private clinics with shorter turn-around-times, rapid tests are unavailable or too costly. Here providers find alternative measures to ensure the POC continuum. In the home setting, patients who can afford a test are not/do not feel empowered to use those devices.; CONCLUSION: These results show that there is much diagnostic delay that deters the POC continuum. Existing rapid tests are currently not translated into treatment decisions rapidly or are not available where they could ensure shorter turn-around times, thus undermining their full potential. To ensure the success of POC testing programs, test developers, decision-makers and funders need to account for such ground realities and overcome barriers to POC testing programs.

AB Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) have the potential to improve healthcare quality and to decrease costs by providing quality metrics, discovering actionable insights, and supporting decision-making to improve future outcomes. Within the United States Medicaid Program, rates of recidivism among emergency department (ED) patients serve as metrics of hospital performance that help ensure efficient and effective treatment within the ED. We analyze ED Medicaid patient data from 1,149,738 EHRs provided by a hospital over a 2-year period to understand the characteristics of the ED return visits within a 72-hour time frame. Frequent flyer patients with multiple revisits account for 47% of Medicaid patient revisits over this period. ED encounters by frequent flyer patients with prior 72-hour revisits in the last 6 months are thrice more likely to result in a readmit than those of infrequent patients. Statistical L1-logistic regression and random forest analyses reveal distinct patterns of ED usage and patient diagnoses between frequent and infrequent patient encounters, suggesting distinct opportunities for interventions to improve efficacy of care and streamline ED workflow. This work forms a foundation for future development of predictive models, which could flag patients at high risk of revisiting.

AB The last several years have seen an explosion of interest in wearable computing, personal tracking devices, and the so-called quantified self (QS) movement. Quantified self involves ordinary people recording and analyzing numerous aspects of their lives to understand and improve themselves. This is now a mainstream phenomenon, attracting a great deal of attention, participation, and funding. As more people are attracted to the movement, companies are offering various new platforms (hardware and software) that allow ever more aspects of daily life to be tracked. Nearly every aspect of the QS ecosystem is advancing rapidly, except for analytic capabilities, which remain surprisingly primitive. With increasing numbers of qualified self participants collecting ever greater amounts and types of data, many people literally have more data than they know what to do with. This article reviews the opportunities and challenges posed by the QS movement. Data science provides well-tested techniques for knowledge discovery. But making these useful for the QS domain poses unique challenges that derive from the characteristics of the data collected as well as the specific types of actionable insights that people want from the data. Using a small sample of QS time series data containing information about personal health we provide a formulation of the QS problem that connects data to the decisions of interest to the user.

AB Medication adherence plays an important role in optimizing the outcomes of many treatment and preventive regimens in chronic illness. Self-report is the most common method for assessing adherence behavior in research and clinical care, but there are questions about its validity and precision. The NIH Adherence Network assembled a panel of adherence research experts working across various chronic illnesses to review self-report medication adherence measures and research on their validity. Self-report medication adherence measures vary substantially in their question phrasing, recall periods, and response items. Self-reports tend to overestimate adherence behavior compared with other assessment methods and generally have high specificity but low sensitivity. Most evidence indicates that self-report adherence measures show moderate correspondence to other adherence measures and can significantly predict clinical outcomes. The quality of self-report adherence measures may be enhanced through efforts to use validated scales, assess the proper construct, improve estimation, facilitate recall, reduce social desirability bias, and employ technologic delivery. Self-report medication adherence measures can provide actionable information despite their limitations. They are preferred when speed, efficiency, and low-cost measures are required, as is often the case in clinical care.

AB Clinical oncology and pathological diagnostics regard cancer as an organ- and tissue-specific disease. Comprehensive mutational profiling information from next-generation sequencing projects may be used to study to what extent the anatomic tumor classifications relate to the observed molecular profiles. Here, we review data that show substantial genetic similarities across major anatomic cancer types and that propose novel tumor classifications based on mutational profiling. Although these studies provide important insight into molecular tumor properties and some even propose novel tumor classification systems, current clinical evidence is lacking that genetic tumor profiling is sufficient to replace histological tumor typing. Recent studies rather show that targeted treatments efficaceous in one tumor type are not necessarily successful in another despite the presence of the same (actionable) mutations. We discuss the implications of the observed complex mutational tumor profiles for targeted therapy selection and future trial design in precision oncology.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, pharmacy-purchased oral rehydration solution (ORS) is often used to treat diarrhea, including cholera. Over-the-counter sales have been used for epidemiologic surveillance in the past, but rarely, if ever, in low-income countries. With few early indicators for cholera outbreaks in endemic areas, diarrhea-related product sales may serve as a useful surveillance tool.; METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tracked daily ORS sales at 50 pharmacies and drug-sellers in an urban Bangladesh community of 129,000 for 6-months while simultaneously conducting surveillance for diarrhea hospitalizations among residents. We developed a mobile phone based system to track the sales of ORS and deployed it in parallel with a paper-based system. Our objectives were to determine if the mobile phone system was practical and acceptable to pharmacists and drug sellers, whether data were reported accurately compared to a paper-based system, and whether ORS sales were associated with future incidence of cholera hospitalizations within the community. We recorded 47,215 customers purchasing ORS, and 315 hospitalized diarrhea cases, 22% of which had culture-confirmed cholera. ORS sales and diarrhea incidence were independently associated with the mean daily temperature; therefore both unadjusted and adjusted models were explored. Through unadjusted cross-correlation statistics and generalized linear models, we found increases in ORS sales were significantly associated with increases in hospitalized diarrhea cases up to 9-days later and hospitalized cholera cases up to one day later. After adjusting for mean daily temperature, ORS was significantly associated with hospitalized diarrhea two days later and hospitalized cholera one day later.; CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pharmacy sales data may serve as a feasible and useful surveillance tool. Given the relatively short lagged correlation between ORS sales and diarrhea, rapid and accurate sales data are key. More work is needed in creating actionable algorithms that make use of this data and in understanding the generalizability of our findings to other settings.

AB Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, especially EGFR-exon 19 deletions and EGFR-L858R, are the most frequent actionable genomic events in lung adenocarcinomas. Tumors arise due to constitutively activated EGFR signaling and are susceptible to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). First generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) and the second generation EGFR TKI afatinib are approved worldwide. Although targeted therapies against EGFR mutants induce dramatic initial responses, acquired resistance (through multiple biological mechanisms) to erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib emerges within the first 1-2 years of continued monotherapy. EGFR-T790M accounts for more than half of acquired resistance to first or second generation EGFR TKIs by modifying ATP affinity and drug binding kinetics. Two new studies have shown that two covalent pyrimidine inhibitors-AZD9291 and rociletinib of EGFR-T790M (i.e., third generation EGFR TKIs) shown remarkable clinical activity in patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib when the tumor carries EGFR-T790M in conjunction with an activating mutation. However, and regrettably, acquired resistance to these third generation EGFR TKIs has already been reported in preclinical models and clinical specimens; such as a tertiary mutation at EGFR-C797S that prevents covalent binding of EGFR TKIs. The experience with sequential EGFR TKI monotherapy highlights tumor heterogeneity and adaptability (i.e., relentless game of whack-a-mole played between TKIs and cancer), and will help shape future clinical development of novel combinatory approaches to manage EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinomas.

AB Isotope labeling experiments (ILEs) and (13)C flux analysis provide actionable information for metabolic engineers to identify knockout, overexpression, and/or media optimization targets. ILEs have been used in both academic and industrial labs to increase product formation, discover novel metabolic functions in previously uncharacterized organisms, and enhance the metabolic efficiency of host cell factories. This review highlights specific examples of how ILEs have been used in conjunction with enzyme or metabolic engineering to elucidate host cell metabolism and improve product titer, rate, or yield in a directed manner. We discuss recent progress and future opportunities involving the use of ILEs and (13)C flux analysis to characterize non-model host organisms and to identify and subsequently eliminate wasteful byproduct pathways or metabolic bottlenecks.

AB BACKGROUND: Progressive independence in patient care activities is imperative for residents' readiness for practice and patient safety of those cared for by graduates of residency programs. However, establishing a standardized system of progressive independence is an ongoing challenge in graduate medical education.; OBJECTIVE: We aggregated trainees' perspectives on progressive independence, developed a model of the ideal state, and suggested actionable improvements.; METHODS: A multispecialty, nationally representative group of trainees conducted a structured exercise that (1) described the attributes of an ideal system of graduated responsibility; (2) compared the current system to that ideal; (3) developed benchmarks to reinforce best practices; and (4) identified approaches to motivate programs to adopt best practices.; RESULTS: At the core of an ideal model of graduated responsibility is a well-structured curriculum and assessment of individual learners using educational milestones and patient outcomes. The ideal model also includes robust faculty development and emphasizes faculty mentorship. To address legal and financial restrictions that pose barriers to progressive independent, objective outcome criteria like the milestones could be used to ask payers to alter payment restrictions for work performed by senior trainees, providing financial incentives for programs to encourage appropriate independent practice. Recognition of high-performing programs at the national level could motivate others to adopt best practices.; CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted approach, incorporating robust 2-way feedback about skill level and autonomy between residents and faculty, along with improved faculty development in this area, is needed to optimize residents' attainment of progressive independence. There are incentives to move programs and institutions toward this optimal model.

AB UNLABELLED: We identified amplification of RICTOR, a key component of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), as the sole actionable genomic alteration in an 18-year-old never-smoker with lung adenocarcinoma. Amplification of RICTOR occurs in 13% of lung cancers (1,016 cases) in The Cancer Genome Atlas and at a similar frequency in an independent cohort of 1,070 patients identified by genomic profiling. In the latter series, 11% of cases harbored RICTOR amplification as the only relevant genomic alteration. Its oncogenic roles were suggested by decreased lung cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo with RICTOR ablation, and the transforming capacity of RICTOR in a Ba/F3-cell system. The mTORC1/2 inhibitors were significantly more active against RICTOR-amplified lung cancer cells as compared with other agents targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Moreover, an association between RICTOR amplification and sensitivities to mTORC1/2 inhibitors was observed. The index patient has been treated with mTORC1/2 inhibitors that led to tumor stabilization for more than 18 months.; SIGNIFICANCE: RICTOR amplification may define a novel and unique molecular subset of patients with lung cancer who may benefit from treatment with mTORC1/2 inhibitors. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: One of the biggest challenges of exome and genome sequencing in the era of genomic medicine is the identification and reporting of secondary findings. In this study we investigated the frequency and spectrum of actionable pathogenic secondary findings in Korean exomes.; METHODS: Data from 196 Korean exomes were screened for variants from a list of 56 genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for return of secondary findings. Identified variants were classified according to the evidence-based guidelines reached by a joint consensus of the ACMG and the Association for Molecular Pathology.; RESULTS: Among the 196 exomes, which were from 100 healthy controls and 96 patients with suspected genetic disorders, 11 variants in 13 individuals were found to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic. We estimated that the frequency of actionable pathogenic secondary findings was 7% for the control subjects (7/100) and 6% for the patients with disease (6/96). For one autosomal-recessive disease, four individuals exhibited either one pathogenic or one likely pathogenic variant of the MUTYH gene, leading to a carrier frequency of 2% (4/196).; CONCLUSION: Secondary findings are not uncommon in Korean exomes.

AB Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters have been shown to significantly impact the exposure of drugs having a high dependence on a single mechanism for their absorption, distribution or clearance, such that genotyping can lead to actionable steps in disease treatment. Recently, global regulatory agencies have provided guidance for assessment of pharmacogenomics during early stages of drug development, both in the form of formal guidance and perspectives published in scientific journals. The Industry Pharmacogenomics Working Group (I-PWG), conducted a survey among member companies to assess the practices relating to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion pharmacogenomics) during early stages of clinical development, to assess the impact of the recent Regulatory Guidance issued by the US FDA and EMA on Industry practices.

AB Long-term objectives associated with cancer survivors have been suggested by Healthy People 2020, including increasing the proportion of survivors living beyond 5 years after diagnosis and improving survivors' mental and physical health-related quality of life. Prior to reaching these objectives, several intermediate steps must be taken to improve the physical, social, emotional, and financial well-being of cancer survivors. Public health has a role in developing strategic, actionable, and measurable approaches to facilitate change at multiple levels to improve the lives of survivors and their families. The social ecological model has been used by the public health community as the foundation of multilevel intervention design and implementation, encouraging researchers and practitioners to explore methods that promote internal and external changes at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy levels. The survivorship community, including public health professionals, providers, policymakers, survivors, advocates, and caregivers, must work collaboratively to identify, develop, and implement interventions that benefit cancer survivors. The National Action Plan for Cancer Survivorship highlights public health domains and associated strategies that can be the impetus for collaboration between and among the levels in the social ecological model and are integral to improving survivor outcomes. This paper describes the Public Health Action Model for Cancer Survivorship, an integrative framework that combines the National Action Plan for Cancer Survivorship with the social ecological model to demonstrate how interaction among the various levels may promote better outcomes for survivors.

AB BACKGROUND: The management of NSCLC has been transformed by stratified medicine. The National Lung Matrix Trial (NLMT) is a UK-wide study exploring the activity of rationally selected biomarker/targeted therapy combinations.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Stratified Medicine Programme 2 is undertaking the large volume national molecular pre-screening which integrates with the NLMT. At study initiation, there are eight drugs being used to target 18 molecular cohorts. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient signal of activity in any drug-biomarker combination to warrant further investigation. A Bayesian adaptive design that gives a more realistic approach to decision making and flexibility to make conclusions without fixing the sample size was chosen. The screening platform is an adaptable 28-gene Nextera next-generation sequencing platform designed by Illumina, covering the range of molecular abnormalities being targeted. The adaptive design allows new biomarker-drug combination cohorts to be incorporated by substantial amendment. The pre-clinical justification for each biomarker-drug combination has been rigorously assessed creating molecular exclusion rules and a trumping strategy in patients harbouring concomitant actionable genetic abnormalities. Discrete routes of pathway activation or inactivation determined by cancer genome aberrations are treated as separate cohorts. Key translational analyses include the deep genomic analysis of pre- and post-treatment biopsies, the establishment of patient-derived xenograft models and longitudinal ctDNA collection, in order to define predictive biomarkers, mechanisms of resistance and early markers of response and relapse.; CONCLUSION: The SMP2 platform will provide large scale genetic screening to inform entry into the NLMT, a trial explicitly aimed at discovering novel actionable cohorts in NSCLC.; CLINICAL TRIAL ISRCTN: 38344105. © The Author 2015.

AB BACKGROUND: The clinical implementation of genomic profiling for lung cancer with high-throughput, multiplex tests is warranted to allow prioritization of appropriate therapies for individual patients. We have now applied such testing to detect actionable mutations that may inform treatment recommendations in lung cancer.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively applied amplicon sequencing panels that cover both mutational hotspots in 22 genes related to lung and colon tumorigenesis as well as 72 major variants of ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 fusion transcripts. We then determined the proportion of patients who received genotype-directed therapy and their overall survival (OS).; RESULTS: Tumor specimens from 110 patients with lung cancer recruited between July 2013 and March 2015 were analyzed. The most common genetic alterations were TP53 mutations in 42 patients, followed by EGFR mutations in 25, STK11 mutations in 12, and KRAS mutations in 10. Potentially actionable mutations were identified in 44 patients including 50% of those with adenocarcinoma and 14% of those with squamous cell carcinoma. The OS of patients with advanced or recurrent cancer who had an actionable mutation and received targeted therapy (median OS not achieved) was significantly longer than that of those with no mutation (18.1 months, P = 0.041) or of those with a mutation not so treated (6.1 months, P = 0.0027).; CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex genomic testing was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens with a success rate of ≥95%. Such testing can assist physicians in matching patients with approved or experimental targeted treatments.; CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The University Medical Hospital Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry under the identifier UMIN000014782. © The Author 2015.

AB Advances in tumor biology and human genetics that have identified driver events and critical dependencies, together with the development of drugs for specific targets, hold promise for an era of personalized oncology treatment. The efficacy of targeted therapies in patient populations selected for treatment on the basis of the molecular features of their tumors is shifting the current practice, and molecular profiling of patients to support clinical decision-making is becoming part of the everyday clinical practice in oncology. Actionable biomarkers are those that allow matching patients to specific therapies. Currently, there is a strong need to have accurate and reliable means of identifying these biomarkers. With the evolution of biotechnology and the advent of next-generation sequencing, platforms for molecular analysis have quickly evolved, allowing a high degree of multiplexing that aims to transform the use of targeted therapies in oncology. This article aims to summarize the different biomarker applications and discuss the current challenges along with the major technologies presently used in clinical practice.

AB We describe the Wellness and Health Omics Linked to the Environment (WHOLE) personalized medicine profile for a 50-year-old Caucasian male living in Atlanta, Georgia. Based on the principle that genomic medicine will be most effective when presented in the context of an individual's clinical and lifestyle data, we propose the use of a "risk radar" that summarizes health risks in eight domains. Rather than providing overwhelming lists of potentially deleterious genetic variants, we argue that profiles should be palatable, actionable, reproducible, and teachable: the PART principle. Genetic risk scores for this individual are strikingly concordant for his height, body mass index (BMI), waist hip ration (WHR), and cholesterol, and blood transcriptome data agrees with and complements his complete blood counts. Despite enjoying currently good health, his risk radar highlights metabolic disease as his major health concern.

AB At the core of the healthcare crisis is fundamental lack of actionable data. Such data could stratify individuals within populations to predict which persons have which outcomes. If baselines existed for all variations of all conditions, then managing health could be improved by matching the measuring of individuals to their cohort in the population. The scale required for complete baselines involves effective National Surveys of Population Health (NSPH). Traditionally, these have been focused upon acute medicine, measuring people to contain the spread of epidemics. In recent decades, the focus has moved to chronic conditions as well, which require smaller measures over longer times. NSPH have long utilized quality of life questionnaires. Mobile Health Monitors, where computing technologies eliminate manual administration, provide richer data sets for health measurement. Older technologies of telephone interviews will be replaced by newer technologies of smartphone sensors to provide deeper individual measures at more frequent timings across larger-sized populations. Such continuous data can provide personal health records, supporting treatment guidelines specialized for population cohorts. Evidence-based medicine will become feasible by leveraging hundreds of millions of persons carrying mobile devices interacting with Internet-scale services for Big Data Analytics.

AB Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of cancer patients' tumours offers the most comprehensive method of identifying both novel and known clinically-actionable genomic targets. However, the practicalities of performing WGS on clinical samples are poorly defined.This study was designed to test sample preparation, sequencing specifications and bioinformatic algorithms for their effect on accuracy and cost-efficiency in a large WGS analysis of human melanoma samples.WGS was performed on melanoma cell lines (n = 15) and melanoma fresh frozen tumours (n = 222). The appropriate level of coverage and the optimal mutation detection algorithm for the project pipeline were determined.An incremental increase in sequencing coverage from 36X to 132X in melanoma tissue samples and 30X to 103X for cell lines only resulted in a small increase (1-2%) in the number of mutations detected, and the quality scores of the additional mutations indicated a low probability that the mutations were real. The results suggest that 60X coverage for melanoma tissue and 40X for melanoma cell lines empower the detection of 98-99% of informative single nucleotide variants (SNVs), a sensitivity level at which clinical decision making or landscape research projects can be carried out with a high degree of confidence in the results. Likewise the bioinformatic mutation analysis methodology strongly influenced the number and quality of SNVs detected. Detecting mutations in the blood genomes separate to the tumour genomes generated 41% more SNVs than if the blood and melanoma tissue genomes were analysed simultaneously. Therefore, simultaneous analysis should be employed on matched melanoma tissue and blood genomes to reduce errors in mutation detection.This study provided valuable insights into the accuracy of SNV with WGS at various coverage levels in human clinical cancer specimens. Additionally, we investigated the accuracy of the publicly available mutation detection algorithms to detect cancer specific SNVs which will aid researchers and clinicians in study design and implementation of WGS for the identification of somatic mutations in other cancers.

AB BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease without established targeted treatment options for patients with metastatic disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate potentially actionable biomarkers in a large cohort of TNBC and compare them with non-TNBCs.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 6341 (2111 TNBC and 4230 non-TNBC) breast cancer samples at a central laboratory for biomarkers of potential drug response across multiple platforms, including gene sequencing, protein expression, and gene copy number.; RESULTS: TNBC expresses androgen receptor (AR) in a significantly (P< .05) lower percentage of cases (17%) than hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast carcinomas (59% and 79%, respectively), and gene comutations were differentially associated with AR-positive versus AR-negative cases. Higher AR expression levels in TNBC predicted for lower Ki-67 levels. Seventy percent of TNBC harbored a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), or phosophatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) aberration. TNBC patients had a significantly lower PIK3CA mutation rate (13%) than all other subtypes (P< .05) and a higher tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutation rate (64%) than the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cases (approximately 30%; P< .05). Topoisomerase 2 (TOP2A) amplification was observed in 1.3% of TNBC and in 1.6% of HER2-negative, HR-positive cancers; in contrast, HER2-positive, HR-negative or HR-positive cancers exhibited TOP2A amplification in 19% and 40% of cases, respectively (P<.05).; CONCLUSION: Multi-platform molecular profiling identifies subgroups of TNBC with different biomarker profiles, suggesting numerous potentially targetable alterations in TNBC. TNBC is further characterized by different gene mutations and proliferative activity relative to AR expression, highlighting a need for comprehensive pathologic examination with potential to develop different, individualized treatment options.

AB BACKGROUND: Informed consent is the cornerstone for protection of human subjects in clinical trials. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that reform of the informed consent process in the United States is needed.; METHODS: The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative conducted interviews with 25 experienced observers of the informed consent process to identify limitations and actionable recommendations for change.; RESULTS: There was broad consensus that current practices often fail to meet the ethical obligation to inform potential research participants during the informed consent process. The most frequent single recommendation, which would affect all participants in federally regulated clinical research, was reform of the informed consent document. The interviews also identified the need for reform of clinical research review by institutional review boards, including transitioning to a single institutional review board for multi-site trials.; CONCLUSION: The consensus recommendations from the interviewees provide a framework for meaningful change in the informed consent process. Although some proposed changes are feasible for rapid implementation, others such as substantive reform of the informed consent document may require change in federal regulations. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) examined the issue of incidental findings in whole exome and whole genome sequencing, and introduced recommendations to search for, evaluate and report medically actionable variants in a set of 56 genes. At a debate held during the 2014 European Society for Human Genetics Conference (ESHG) in Milan, Italy, the first author of that paper presented this view in a debate session that did not end with a conclusive vote from the mainly European audience for or against reporting back actionable incidental findings. In this meeting report, we elaborate on the discussions held during a special meeting hosted at the ESHG in 2013 from posing the question 'How to reach a (European) consensus on reporting incidental findings and unclassified variants in diagnostic next generation sequencing'. We ask whether an European consensus exists on the reporting of incidental findings in genome diagnostics, and present a series of key issues that require discussion at both a national and European level in order to develop recommendations for handling incidental findings and unclassified variants in line with the legal and cultural particularities of individual European member states.

AB The success of biobank-based genomic research is widely dependent on people's willingness to donate their tissue. Thus, stakeholders' opinions should be considered in the development of best practice guidelines for research and recruiting participants. We systematically analyzed the empirical literature describing different stakeholders' views towards ethical questions with regard to type of consent, data sharing and return of incidental findings. Patients are more open to one-time general consent than the public. Only a small proportion desires recontact if the research aim changed. A broad consent model would prevent only a small proportion of patients from participating in research. Although professionals are concerned about a risk of reidentification, patients and the public support data sharing and find that the benefit of research outweighs the potential risk of reidentification. However, they desire detailed information about the privacy protection measures. Regarding the return of incidental findings, the public and professionals focus on clinically actionable results, whereas patients are interested in receiving as much information as possible. For professionals, concrete guidelines that help managing the return of incidental findings should be warranted. For this it would be helpful addressing the different categories - actionable, untreatable and inheritable diseases - upfront with patients and public.

AB As tuberculosis (TB) incidence decreases in the US, foreign-born persons continue to account for a larger proportion of the burden. In these cross-sectional analyses of 1149 culture-confirmed TB cases genotyped using spoligotyping and 24-locus MIRU, we show that over a quarter of cases among the foreign-born population in Florida resulted from recent transmission of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. In addition, over a third of these cases occurred among persons who had immigrated 5 years or less prior to their diagnosis. Although recent immigration was not a significant predictor of TB transmission, younger age, birthplace in the Americas, homelessness, drug use and TB lineage are risk factors for TB transmission among the foreign-born population in Florida. These data provide actionable insights into TB transmission among the foreign-born population in Florida. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy regimens for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GC) remain interchangeable; however, response rates are frequently suboptimal. Biomarkers from ICC and GC patients were interrogated to identify actionable differences with potential therapeutic implications.; METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, pathological specimens from 217 ICC and 28 GC patients referred to Caris Life Sciences were evaluated. Specific testing by immunohistochemical analysis for 17 different biomarkers was performed.; RESULTS: In the collective cohort (n = 245), actionable targets included: 95% low thymidylate synthase (TS), 82% low ribonucleotide reductase subunit M (RMM) 1 and 74% low excision repair cross complementation group (ERCC) 1, indicating potential susceptibility to fluoropyrimidines/capecitabine, gemcitabine and platinum agents, respectively. Additional targets included TOPO1 (53.3% high, Irinotecan), MGMT (50.3% low, temozolomide), TOP2A (33% high, anthracyclines) and PGP (30.1% low, taxanes). Subgroup analysis by tumour origin demonstrated a differential biomarker expression pattern with a higher frequency of ICC tumours showing low levels of TS (99% versus 72%, P < 0.01), and RRM1 (85% versus 64%, P = 0.02) when compared with GC. Conversely a greater frequency of GC demonstrated high levels of TOPO1 (76% versus 50%, P = 0.02) versus ICC, indicating a potential increased benefit from irinotecan.; DISCUSSION: Differences in the molecular profiles between ICC and GC provide evidence that the two are distinct diseases, requiring different treatment strategies to optimize a response. © 2015 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association.

AB UNLABELLED: Both high and low indoor relative humidity (RH) directly impact Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), an important school health concern. Prior school studies reported a high prevalence of mold, roaches, and water damage; however, few examined associations between modifiable classroom factors and RH, a quantitative indicator of dampness. We recorded RH longitudinally in 134 North Carolina classrooms (n = 9066 classroom-days) to quantify the relationships between modifiable classroom factors and average daily RH below, within, or above levels recommended to improve school IAQ (30-50% or 30-60% RH). The odds of having high RH (>60%) were 5.8 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.9, 11.3] times higher in classrooms with annual compared to quarterly heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system maintenance and 2.5 (95% CI: 1.5, 4.2) times higher in classrooms with HVAC economizers compared to those without economizers. Classrooms with direct-expansion split systems compared to chilled water systems had 2.7 (95% CI: 1.7, 4.4) times higher odds of low RH (<30%). When unoccupied, classrooms with thermostat setbacks had 3.7 (95% CI: 1.7, 8.3) times the odds of high RH (>60%) of those without setbacks. This research suggests actionable decision points for school design and maintenance to prevent high or low classroom RH.; PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study combines longitudinal measurements of classroom relative humidity with school inspection data from several schools to describe the problem of relative humidity control in schools. Our findings on how maintenance and mechanical factors affect classroom humidity provide suggestions on building operations policies and heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) design considerations that may improve classroom relative humidity control. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB INTRODUCTION: Unplanned 30-day hospital readmission account for roughly $17 billion in annual Medicare spending. Many factors contribute to unplanned hospital readmissions and multiple models have been developed over the years to predict them. Most researchers have used insurance claims or administrative data to train and operationalize their Readmission Risk Prediction Models (RRPMs). Some RRPM developers have also used electronic health records data; however, using health informatics exchange data has been uncommon among such predictive models and can be beneficial in its ability to provide real-time alerts to providers at the point of care.; METHODS: We conducted a semi-systematic review of readmission predictive factors published prior to March 2013. Then, we extracted and merged all significant variables listed in those articles for RRPMs. Finally, we matched these variables with common HL7 messages transmitted by a sample of health information exchange organizations (HIO).; RESULTS: The semi-systematic review resulted in identification of 32 articles and 297 predictive variables. The mapping of these variables with common HL7 segments resulted in an 89.2% total coverage, with the DG1 (diagnosis) segment having the highest coverage of 39.4%. The PID (patient identification) and OBX (observation results) segments cover 13.9% and 9.1% of the variables. Evaluating the same coverage in three sample HIOs showed data incompleteness.; DISCUSSION: HIOs can utilize HL7 messages to develop unique RRPMs for their stakeholders; however, data completeness of exchanged messages should meet certain thresholds. If data quality standards are met by stakeholders, HIOs would be able to provide real-time RRPMs that not only predict intra-hospital readmissions but also inter-hospital cases.; CONCLUSION: A RRPM derived using HIO data exchanged through may prove to be a useful method to prevent unplanned hospital readmissions. In order for the RRPM derived from HIO data to be effective, hospitals must actively exchange clinical information through the HIO and develop actionable methods that integrate into the workflow of providers to ensure that patients at high-risk for readmission receive the care they need.

AB The study of nanomaterial impacts on environment, health and safety (nanoEHS) has been largely predicated on the assumption that exposure and hazard can be predicted from physical-chemical properties of nanomaterials. This approach is rooted in the view that nanoobjects essentially resemble chemicals with additional particle-based attributes that must be included among their intrinsic physical-chemical descriptors. With the exception of the trivial case of nanomaterials made from toxic or highly reactive materials, this approach has yielded few actionable guidelines for predicting nanomaterial risk. This article addresses inherent problems in structuring a nanoEHS research strategy based on the goal of predicting outcomes directly from nanomaterial properties, and proposes a framework for organizing data and designing integrated experiments based on functional assays (FAs). FAs are intermediary, semi-empirical measures of processes or functions within a specified system that bridge the gap between nanomaterial properties and potential outcomes in complex systems. The three components of a functional assay are standardized protocols for parameter determination and reporting, a theoretical context for parameter application and reference systems. We propose the identification and adoption of reference systems where FAs may be applied to provide parameter estimates for environmental fate and effects models, as well as benchmarks for comparing the results of FAs and experiments conducted in more complex and varied systems. Surface affinity and dissolution rate are identified as two critical FAs for characterizing nanomaterial behavior in a variety of important systems. The use of these FAs to predict bioaccumulation and toxicity for initial and aged nanomaterials is illustrated for the case of silver nanoparticles and Caenorhabditis elegans.

AB Sleep disturbances are a common reaction to stress and are linked to a host of physical and mental health problems. Given the unprecedented demands placed on U.S. military forces since 2001, there has been growing concern about the prevalence and consequences of sleep problems for servicemembers. Sleep problems often follow a chronic course, persisting long after servicemembers return home from combat deployments, with consequences for their reintegration and the readiness and resiliency of the force. Therefore, it is critical to understand the role of sleep problems in servicemembers' health and functioning and the policies and programs available to promote healthy sleep. This study provides the first comprehensive review of sleep-related policies and programs across the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), along with a set of actionable recommendations for DoD, commanders, researchers, and medical professionals who treat U.S. servicemembers. The two-year multimethod study also examined the rates and correlates of sleep problems among post-deployed servicemembers, finding negative effects on mental health, daytime impairment, and perceived operational readiness. The research reviewed evidence-based interventions to treat sleep disturbances among servicemembers and veterans and exposed several individual- and system-level barriers to achieving healthy sleep. Implementing evidence-based treatments is just one step toward improving sleep across the force; as the research recommendations highlight, it is equally important that policies and programs also focus on preventing sleep problems and their consequences.

AB This issue of Philosophical Transactions examines the relationship between scientific uncertainty about climate change and knowledge. Uncertainty is an inherent feature of the climate system. Considerable effort has therefore been devoted to understanding how to effectively respond to a changing, yet uncertain climate. Politicians and the public often appeal to uncertainty as an argument to delay mitigative action. We argue that the appropriate response to uncertainty is exactly the opposite: uncertainty provides an impetus to be concerned about climate change, because greater uncertainty increases the risks associated with climate change. We therefore suggest that uncertainty can be a source of actionable knowledge. We survey the papers in this issue, which address the relationship between uncertainty and knowledge from physical, economic and social perspectives. We also summarize the pervasive psychological effects of uncertainty, some of which may militate against a meaningful response to climate change, and we provide pointers to how those difficulties may be ameliorated.  © 2015 The Author(s).

AB Sequencing of the mutant allele fraction of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from tumors is increasingly utilized to detect actionable genomic alterations in cancer. We conducted a prospective blinded study of a comprehensive cfDNA sequencing panel with 54 cancer genes. To evaluate the concordance between cfDNA and tumor DNA (tDNA), sequencing results were compared between cfDNA from plasma and genomic tumor DNA (tDNA). Utilizing next generation digital sequencing technology (DST), we profiled approximately 78,000 bases encoding 512 complete exons in the targeted genes in cfDNA from plasma. Seventy-five patients were prospectively enrolled between February 2013 and March 2014, including 61 metastatic cancer patients and 14 clinical stage II CRC patients with matched plasma and tissue samples. Using the 54-gene panel, we detected at least one somatic mutation in 44 of 61 tDNA (72.1%) and 29 of 44 (65.9%) cfDNA. The overall concordance rate of cfDNA to tDNA was 85.9%, when all detected mutations were considered. We collected serial cfDNAs during cetuximab-based treatment in 2 metastatic KRAS wild-type CRC patients, one with acquired resistance and one with primary resistance. We demonstrate newly emerged KRAS mutation in cfDNA 1.5 months before radiologic progression. Another patient had a newly emerged PIK3CA H1047R mutation on cfDNA analysis at progression during cetuximab/irinotecan chemotherapy with gradual increase in allele frequency from 0.8 to 2.1%. This blinded, prospective study of a cfDNA sequencing showed high concordance to tDNA suggesting that the DST approach may be used as a non-invasive biopsy-free alternative to conventional sequencing using tumor biopsy.

AB BACKGROUND: We have investigated the incidence of NTRK1 rearrangements in metastatic gastrointestinal cancer patients and demonstrated the potential for clinical response of these patients to targeted therapy.; METHODS: We prospectively collected tumor tissue specimens for one year and simultaneously generated patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs). Specimens were initially screened for TrkA protein expression using TrkA immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the case of TrkA IHC positive results, samples were further examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS) to confirm the presence of NTRK1 rearrangements.; RESULTS: From January 2014 to December 2014, a total of 74 metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 66 gastric cancer (GC) patients were initially screened by TrkA IHC. Two of the 74 CRC patients (2.7%) and one of the 66 GC patients (1.5%) were positive for TrkA expression by IHC. All three IHC positive cases had evidence of NTRK1 rearrangements by FISH. NGS was performed on the 3 IHC positive cases and confirmed TPM3-NTRK1 rearrangements in the two CRC cases. One GC patient with TrkA expression by IHC did not harbor an NTRK1 rearrangement. PDCs established from the NTRK1 positive CRC patients were positive for the NTRK1 rearrangement. Entrectinib, a pan-TRK inhibitor, profoundly inhibited cell proliferation of NTRK1-rearranged PDCs with such inhibition associated with inactivation of TrkA, and down-regulation of downstream signaling pathways.; CONCLUSIONS: TrkA IHC is an effective, initial screening method for NTRK1 rearrangement detection in the clinic. Inhibition of the TrkA kinase is a promising targeted therapy for cancer patients whose tumors harbor a NTRK1 rearrangement.

AB Although a variety of genetic alterations have been found across cancer types, the identification and functional characterization of candidate driver genetic lesions in an individual patient and their translation into clinically actionable strategies remain major hurdles. Here, we use whole genome sequencing of a prostate cancer tumor, computational analyses, and experimental validation to identify and predict novel oncogenic activity arising from a point mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor protein. We demonstrate that this mutation (p.A126G) produces an enzymatic gain-of-function in PTEN, shifting its function from a phosphoinositide (PI) 3-phosphatase to a phosphoinositide (PI) 5-phosphatase. Using cellular assays, we demonstrate that this gain-of-function activity shifts cellular phosphoinositide levels, hyperactivates the PI3K/Akt cell proliferation pathway, and exhibits increased cell migration beyond canonical PTEN loss-of-function mutants. These findings suggest that mutationally modified PTEN can actively contribute to well-defined hallmarks of cancer. Lastly, we demonstrate that these effects can be substantially mitigated through chemical PI3K inhibitors. These results demonstrate a new dysfunction paradigm for PTEN cancer biology and suggest a potential framework for the translation of genomic data into actionable clinical strategies for targeted patient therapy.

AB Advances in high-throughput materials fabrication and characterization techniques have resulted in faster rates of data collection and rapidly growing volumes of experimental data. To convert this mass of information into actionable knowledge of material process-structure-property relationships requires high-throughput data analysis techniques. This work explores the use of the Graph-based endmember extraction and labeling (GRENDEL) algorithm as a high-throughput method for analyzing structural data from combinatorial libraries, specifically, to determine phase diagrams and constituent phases from both x-ray diffraction and Raman spectral data. The GRENDEL algorithm utilizes a set of physical constraints to optimize results and provides a framework by which additional physics-based constraints can be easily incorporated. GRENDEL also permits the integration of database data as shown by the use of critically evaluated data from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database in the x-ray diffraction data analysis. Also the Sunburst radial tree map is demonstrated as a tool to visualize material structure-property relationships found through graph based analysis.

AB There is substantial heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, evident in the spectrum of molecular abnormalities and its variable clinical course. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of 333 primary prostate carcinomas. Our results revealed a molecular taxonomy in which 74% of these tumors fell into one of seven subtypes defined by specific gene fusions (ERG, ETV1/4, and FLI1) or mutations (SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1). Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25% of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19%. Our analysis reveals molecular heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, as well as potentially actionable molecular defects.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Diabetes afflicts 382 million people worldwide, with increasing prevalence rates and adverse effects on health, well-being, and society in general. There are many drivers for the complex presentation of diabetes, including environmental and genetic/epigenetic factors.; OBJECTIVE: The aim was to synthesize a core set of recommendations from information from 14 countries that can be used to optimize diabetes care on a global scale.; METHODS: Information from 14 papers in this special issue of Annals of Global Health was reviewed, analyzed, and sorted to synthesize recommendations. PubMed was searched for relevant studies on diabetes and global health.; FINDINGS: Key findings are as follows: (1) Population-based transitions distinguish region-specific diabetes care; (2) biological drivers for diabetes differ among various populations and need to be clarified scientifically; (3) principal resource availability determines quality-of-care metrics; and (4) governmental involvement, independent of economic barriers, improves the contextualization of diabetes care. Core recommendations are as follows: (1) Each nation should assess region-specific epidemiology, the scientific evidence base, and population-based transitions to establish risk-stratified guidelines for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions; (2) each nation should establish a public health imperative to provide tools and funding to successfully implement these guidelines; and (3) each nation should commit to education and research to optimize recommendations for a durable effect.; CONCLUSIONS: Systematic acquisition of information about diabetes care can be analyzed, extrapolated, and then used to provide a core set of actionable recommendations that may be further studied and implemented to improve diabetes care on a global scale.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinicians working with youth with disabilities have acknowledged making friends as a commonly identified client goal. Clinicians find this goal difficult to address, as there are no measures that provide a breakdown of making friends into functional steps. In addition, research on friendship has traditionally focused on characteristics and quality of friendships rather than the friend-making process as a whole. A goal menu, comprised of a variety of steps that address the goal of making friends, would provide guidance to clinicians challenged with this goal in practice.; PURPOSE: To develop an understanding of the friend-making process as a first step towards the development of a goal menu for the goal of making friends.; METHODS: A literature review, youth focus group and expert clinician semi-structured interviews and consultation were used to generate a comprehensive data set. Established qualitative methods were used to sort and group the data into categories. A thematic analysis of the categories was performed.; RESULTS: Analysis revealed four themes integral to the friend-making process: person factors influencing friend-making, making friend-making a priority, opportunity for friend-making and motivation to make friends. An additional theme identified as occasionally involved in the process was a little bit of luck in making friends.; CONCLUSIONS: The themes generated by this research indicate that actionable target areas exist for the somewhat abstract notion of friend-making and the authors recommend that clinicians explore beyond person factors when addressing the goal of making friends. As a next step, the identified themes will provide the foundation for a goal menu, ultimately enabling clinicians to address the goal of making friends in a more efficient and effective manner. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Information age technology has the potential to change the game for conservation by continuously monitoring the pulse of the natural world. Whether or not it will depends on the ability of the conservation sector to build a community of practice, come together to define key technology challenges and work with a wide variety of partners to create, implement, and sustain solutions. I describe why these steps are necessary, outline the latest developments in the field and offer actionable ways forward for conservation agencies, universities, funding bodies, professional societies, and technology corporations to come together to realize the revolution that computational technologies can bring for biodiversity conservation.

AB PURPOSE: Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is an increasingly popular approach to breast conserving therapy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. A drawback to IORT compared with postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy is that it is not performed using image guidance. Our aim was to report on how our institution's unique IORT workflow integrates CT image guidance and how these CT images were used intraoperatively to change applicator positioning.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the first 29 patients who participated in a prospective clinical trial of breast IORT at our institution. All patients underwent lumpectomy, multicatheter balloon placement, intraoperative CT scan, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment delivery to 12.5 Gy to 1 cm from the balloon surface. This report focuses on the intraoperative CT findings that led to clinical changes, followed by repeat CT for IORT treatment planning.; RESULTS: After initial intraoperative CT, 7 patients underwent an additional intraoperative CT scan (24.1%). In 6 patients, the initial intraoperative CT scan identified large air cavities and/or poor tissue conformity. This defect could be improved in all patients with adjustment of the balloon applicator before planning and delivering IORT. Intraoperative CT scan was used in one patient to localize a biopsy clip and aided in excision to negative margin.; CONCLUSIONS: In our study, intraoperative CT identifies actionable findings in breast IORT, including residual tumor or errors in applicator positioning, in almost 25% of patients. Clinical results of the described trial will serve to further validate this image-guided approach to IORT. Copyright © 2015 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Cytogenomic microarray analysis (CMA) offers high resolution, genome-wide copy number information and is widely used in clinical laboratories for diagnosis of constitutional abnormalities. The Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC) conducted a multiplatform, multicenter clinical validation project to compare the reliability and inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility of this technology for clinical oncology applications. Four specimen types were processed on three different microarray platforms-from Affymetrix, Agilent, and Illumina. Each microarray platform was employed at two independent test sites. The results were compared in a blinded manner with current standard methods, including karyotype, FISH, or morphology. Twenty-nine chronic lymphocytic leukemia blood, 34 myelodysplastic syndrome bone marrow, and 30 fresh frozen renal epithelial tumor samples were assessed by all six laboratories. Thirty formalin fixed paraffin embedded renal tumor samples were analyzed at the Affymetrix and Agilent test sites only. All study samples were initial diagnostic samples. Array data were analyzed at each participating site and were submitted to caArray for central analysis. Laboratory interpretive results were submitted to the central analysis team for comparison with the standard-of-care assays and for calculation of intraplatform reproducibility and cross-platform concordance. The results demonstrated that the three microarray platforms 1) detect clinically actionable genomic changes in cancer compatible to standard-of-care methods; 2) further define cytogenetic aberrations; 3) identify submicroscopic alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH); and 4) yield consistent results within and between laboratories. Based on this study, the CGC concludes that CMA is a sensitive and reliable technique for copy number and LOH assessment that may be used for clinical oncology genomic analysis.

AB PURPOSE: Electronic health records (EHRs) and their associated decision support tools are potentially important means of disseminating a patient's pharmacogenomic profile to his or her health-care providers. We sought to create a proof-of-concept decision support alert system generated from pharmacogenomic incidental findings from exome sequencing.; METHODS: A pipeline for alerts from exome sequencing tests was created for patients in the New EXome Technology in (NEXT) Medicine study at the University of Washington. Decision support rules using discrete, machine-readable incidental finding results were programmed into a commercial EHR rules engine. An evaluation plan to monitor the alerts in real medical interactions was established.; RESULTS: Alerts were created for 48 actionable pharmacogenomic variants in 11 genes and were launched on 24 September 2014 for University of Washington inpatient care. Of the 94 participants enrolled in the NEXT Medicine study, 49 had one or more pharmacogenomic variants identified for return.; CONCLUSION: Reflections on the process reveal that while incidental findings can be used to generate decision support alerts, substantial resources are required to ensure that each alert is consistent with rapidly evolving pharmacogenomic literature and is customized to fit in the clinical workflow unique to each incidental finding.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anomaly detection, as an imperative task for clinical pathway (CP) analysis and improvement, can provide useful and actionable knowledge of interest to clinical experts to be potentially exploited. Existing studies mainly focused on the detection of global anomalous inpatient traces of CPs using the similarity measures in a structured manner, which brings order in the chaos of CPs, may decline the accuracy of similarity measure between inpatient traces, and may distort the efficiency of anomaly detection. In addition, local anomalies that exist in some subsegments of events or behaviors in inpatient traces are easily overlooked by existing approaches since they are designed for detecting global or large anomalies.; METHOD: In this study, we employ a probabilistic topic model to discover underlying treatment patterns, and assume any significant unexplainable deviations from the normal behaviors surmised by the derived patterns are strongly correlated with anomalous behaviours. In this way, we can figure out the detailed local abnormal behaviors and the associations between these anomalies such that diagnostic information on local anomalies can be provided.; RESULTS: The proposed approach is evaluated via a clinical data-set, including 2954 unstable angina patient traces and 483,349 clinical events, extracted from a Chinese hospital. Using the proposed method, local anomalies are detected from the log. In addition, the identified associations between the detected local anomalies are derived from the log, which lead to clinical concern on the reason resulting in these anomalies in CPs. The correctness of the proposed approach has been evaluated by three experience cardiologists of the hospital. For four types of local anomalies (i.e., unexpected events, early events, delay events, and absent events), the proposed approach achieves 94%, 71% 77%, and 93.2% in terms of recall. This is quite remarkable as we do not use a prior knowledge.; CONCLUSION: Substantial experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect local anomalies in CPs, and also provide diagnostic information on the detected anomalies in an informative manner.

AB PURPOSE: Multiplex genomic tests are enabling oncologists to interrogate the DNA of their patients. However, few oncologists are proficient with respect to the implications of complex molecular diagnostics. We initiated a Molecular Tumor Board that focused on individual patients with advanced cancer whose tumors underwent genomic profiling, and here report our experience with breast cancer.; METHODS: A multidisciplinary team that included physicians, scientists, geneticists, and bioinformatics/pathway specialists attended. All molecular tests were performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments environment (next-generation sequencing, 182 or 236 genes).; RESULTS: Forty of 43 patients (93%; mean age, 59 years) had at least one theoretically actionable aberration (mean, 4.79 anomalies/patient). Median time from ordering to report was 27 days (median of approximately 11 days for specimen acquisition and approximately 14 days for diagnostic processing). Even if we considered distinct abnormalities in a gene as the same, there were only two patients with an identical molecular profile. Seventy-three genes (206 abnormalities; 119 distinct) were aberrant. Seventeen of the 43 patients (40%; median, seven previous therapies in the metastatic setting) were treated in a manner consistent with Molecular Tumor Board discussions; seven (16% of 43, or 41% of 17) achieved stable disease for 6 or more months (n = 2) or partial remission (n = 5). Lack of access to targeted medication was the most common reason that patients could not be treated.; CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards may help to optimize the management of patients with advanced, heavily pretreated breast cancer who have undergone genomic testing. Facilitating availability of appropriately targeted drugs and clinical trials is needed. Copyright © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB OBJECTIVE: Clinicians' ability to use and interpret genetic information depends upon how those data are displayed in electronic health records (EHRs). There is a critical need to develop systems to effectively display genetic information in EHRs and augment clinical decision support (CDS).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research and Electronic Medical Records & Genomics EHR Working Groups conducted a multiphase, iterative process involving working group discussions and 2 surveys in order to determine how genetic and genomic information are currently displayed in EHRs, envision optimal uses for different types of genetic or genomic information, and prioritize areas for EHR improvement.; RESULTS: There is substantial heterogeneity in how genetic information enters and is documented in EHR systems. Most institutions indicated that genetic information was displayed in multiple locations in their EHRs. Among surveyed institutions, genetic information enters the EHR through multiple laboratory sources and through clinician notes. For laboratory-based data, the source laboratory was the main determinant of the location of genetic information in the EHR. The highest priority recommendation was to address the need to implement CDS mechanisms and content for decision support for medically actionable genetic information.; CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity of genetic information flow and importance of source laboratory, rather than clinical content, as a determinant of information representation are major barriers to using genetic information optimally in patient care. Greater effort to develop interoperable systems to receive and consistently display genetic and/or genomic information and alert clinicians to genomic-dependent improvements to clinical care is recommended.

AB BACKGROUND: With advances such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) increasing understanding of the basis of cancer and its response to treatment, NCCN believes it is important to understand how molecular profiling/diagnostic testing is being performed and used at NCCN Member Institutions and their community affiliates.; METHODS: The NCCN Oncology Research Program's Investigator Steering Committee and the NCCN Best Practices Committee gathered baseline information on the use of cancer-related molecular testing at NCCN Member Institutions and community members of the NCCN Affiliate Research Consortium through 2 separate surveys distributed in December 2013 and September 2014, respectively.; RESULTS: A total of 24 NCCN Member Institutions and 8 affiliate sites provided quantitative and qualitative data. In the context of these surveys, "molecular profiling/diagnostics" was defined as a panel of at least 10 genes examined as a diagnostic DNA test in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory.; CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that molecular profiling/diagnostics are used at 100% of survey respondents' institutions to make patient care decisions. However, challenges relating to reimbursement, lack of data regarding actionable targets and targeted therapies, and access to drugs on or off clinical trials were cited as barriers to integration of molecular profiling into patient care. Frameworks for using molecular diagnostic results based on levels of evidence, alongside continued research into the predictive value of biomarkers and targeted therapies, are recommended to advance understanding of the role of genomic biomarkers. Greater evidence and consensus regarding the clinical and cost-effectiveness of molecular profiling may lead to broader insurance coverage and increased integration into patient care.

AB Drug development for common complex diseases is in need of new molecular entities and actionable drug targets. MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is associated with numerous diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Understanding the structural basis of ligands' (inhibitors) and substrates' binding to MARK4 is crucial to design new kinase inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. This study reports new observations on docking three well-known kinase inhibitors in the kinase domain of MARK4 variants and the calculated binding affinity. These variants of MARK4 are named as MARK4-F1 (59N-terminal residues along with kinase domain) and MARK4-F2 (kinase domain of MARK4). We additionally performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and fluorescence binding studies to calculate the actual binding affinity of kinase inhibitors, BX-912, BX-795, and OTSSP167 (hydrochloride) for the MARK4. Docking analyses revealed that ligands bind in the large hydrophobic cavity of the kinase domain of MARK4 through several hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonded interactions. Simulations suggested that OTSSP167 (hydrochloride) is forming a stable complex, and hence the best inhibitor of MARK4. Intrinsic fluorescence of MARK4 was significantly quenched by addition of ligands, indicating their potential binding to MARK4. A lower KD value of MARK4 with OTSSP167 (hydrochloride) suggested that it is a better interacting partner than BX-912 and BX-795. These data form a basis for designing novel and potent OTSSP167 (hydrochloride) derivatives as therapeutic candidates against common complex diseases. The inhibitors designed as such might possibly suppress the growth of tumor-forming cells and be potentially applied for treatment of a wide range of human cancers as well.

AB BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act mandates that most women of reproductive age with private health insurance have full contraceptive coverage with no out-of-pocket costs, creating an actionable time for women to evaluate their contraceptive choices without cost considerations. The MyNewOptions study is a three-arm, randomized, controlled trial testing web-based interventions aimed at assisting privately insured women with making contraceptive choices that are consistent with their reproductive goals.; METHODS: Privately insured women between the ages of 18 and 40 not intending pregnancy were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) a reproductive life planning (RLP) intervention, 2) a reproductive life planning enriched with contraceptive action planning (RLP+) intervention, or 3) an information only control group. Both the RLP and RLP+ guide women to identify their individualized reproductive goals and contraceptive method requirements. The RLP+ additionally includes a contraceptive action planning component, which uses if-then scenarios that allow the user to problem solve situations that make it difficult to be adherent to their contraceptive method. All three groups have access to a reproductive options library containing information about their contraceptive coverage and the attributes of alternative contraceptive methods. Women completed a baseline survey with follow-up surveys every 6 months for 2 years concurrent with intervention boosters. Study outcomes include contraceptive use and adherence. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02100124.; DISCUSSION: Results from the MyNewOptions study will demonstrate whether web-based reproductive life planning, with or without contraceptive action planning, helps insured women make patient-centered contraceptive choices compared with an information-only control condition.

AB UNLABELLED: Brain metastases are associated with a dismal prognosis. Whether brain metastases harbor distinct genetic alterations beyond those observed in primary tumors is unknown. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 86 matched brain metastases, primary tumors, and normal tissue. In all clonally related cancer samples, we observed branched evolution, where all metastatic and primary sites shared a common ancestor yet continued to evolve independently. In 53% of cases, we found potentially clinically informative alterations in the brain metastases not detected in the matched primary-tumor sample. In contrast, spatially and temporally separated brain metastasis sites were genetically homogenous. Distal extracranial and regional lymph node metastases were highly divergent from brain metastases. We detected alterations associated with sensitivity to PI3K/AKT/mTOR, CDK, and HER2/EGFR inhibitors in the brain metastases. Genomic analysis of brain metastases provides an opportunity to identify potentially clinically informative alterations not detected in clinically sampled primary tumors, regional lymph nodes, or extracranial metastases.; SIGNIFICANCE: Decisions for individualized therapies in patients with brain metastasis are often made from primary-tumor biopsies. We demonstrate that clinically actionable alterations present in brain metastases are frequently not detected in primary biopsies, suggesting that sequencing of primary biopsies alone may miss a substantial number of opportunities for targeted therapy. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Pediatric primary and specialty practice has changed, with more to do, more regulation, and more family needs than in the past. Similarly, the needs of patients have changed, with more demographic diversity, family stress, and continued health disparities by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. How can clinicians continue their dedicated service to children and ensure health equity in the face of these changes? This article outlines specific, practical, actionable, and evidence-based activities to help clinicians assess and address health disparities in practice. These tools may also support patient-centered medical home recognition, national and state cultural and linguistic competency standards, and quality benchmarks that are increasingly tied to payment. Clinicians can play a critical role in (1) diagnosing disparities in one's community and practice, (2) innovating new models to address social determinants of health, (3) addressing health literacy of families, (4) ensuring cultural competence and a culture of workplace equity, and (5) advocating for issues that address the root causes of health disparities. Culturally competent care that is sensitive to the needs, health literacy, and health beliefs of families can increase satisfaction, improve quality of care, and increase patient safety. Clinical care approaches to address social determinants of health and interrupting the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage include (1) screening for new health "vital signs" and connecting families to resources, (2) enhancing the comprehensiveness of services, (3) addressing family health in pediatric encounters, and (4) moving care outside the office into the community. Health system investment is required to support clinicians and practice innovation to ensure equity. Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal disease, and improvement with androgen-deprivation therapy has plateaued. Next-generation sequencing studies have led to significant advances in our understanding of genomic alterations in prostate cancer. The most common genomic aberrations in this malignancy are the transcription factor fusion of TMPRSS2-ETS, and mutations in TP53, AR, RB1 and PTEN/PIK3CA. Some of these alterations are actionable by drugs available in the clinic. In addition, it was recently shown that aberrations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA2 and ATM, are present in both somatic and germline form in a significant minority of prostate cancer; these abnormalities can be targeted by drugs such as platinums and PARP inhibitors. In the era of tumour profiling, targeting molecular alterations may provide an opportunity for new therapeutic approaches. Although there are promising new agents to attack a variety of genomic signal abnormalities, biomarker-matched therapy (other than for androgens) have been utilised in only 2.0% of clinical trials (September 2011 through September 2014; https://clinicaltrials.gov) for prostate cancer. Enhanced efforts to define subsets of patients with prostate cancer based on their molecular anomalies, and match them with cognate therapies, warrant investigation.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

AB A multidimensional approach involving consideration of available resources, individual patient characteristics, patient preferences, and cost of treatment is often required to optimize clinical decision making in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). In order to bring together varying perspectives on effective tactics and to formulate innovative strategies to improve the management of AF, a think tank consortium of advisors was assembled from across the spectrum of health care stakeholders. Focus groups were conducted and facilitated by a moderator and a notetaker. Participants were asked to comment on preliminary data for the increased prevalence of AF, patterns of treatment, impact of adherence with anticoagulants on clinical and economic outcomes, and opportunities for optimizing treatment.Several recommendations to reach short- and long-term goals in improving AF management emerged from the focus group discussions. These recommendations specifically targeted 3 stakeholder groups--patients/caregivers, physicians, and payers--and addressed the need for better understanding of determinants of undertreatment and nonadherence for those on anticoagulation therapy. Recommendations included the use of real-world data studies to understand regional and demographic patterns of treatment and outcomes, the development of an enhanced national quality standard for anticoagulation, and engaging patients in shared decision making to optimize satisfaction with treatment. Actionable strategies were presented to address gaps related to anticoagulation management. Balancing new anticoagulants' higher prescription costs and safety concerns with their superior effectiveness and convenience of administration for at-risk individuals would require a concerted effort involving patients and their caregivers, physicians, and payers.

AB CONTEXT: The physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) paradigm allows health care professionals to document the treatment preferences of patients with advanced illness or frailty as portable and actionable medical orders. National standards encourage offering POLST orders to patients for whom clinicians would not be surprised if they died in the next year.; OBJECTIVES: To determine the influence of cause of death on the timing of POLST form completion and on changes to POLST orders as death approaches.; METHODS: This was a cohort study of 18,285 Oregon POLST Registry decedents who died in 2010-2011 matched to Oregon death certificates.; RESULTS: The median interval between POLST completion and death was 6.4 weeks. Those dying of cancer had forms completed nearer death (median 5.1 weeks) than those with organ failure (10.6 weeks) or dementia (14.5 weeks; P < 0.001). More than 90% of final POLST forms indicated orders for no resuscitation and 65.1% listed orders for comfort measures only. Eleven percent of the sample had multiple registered forms during the two years preceding their death, with the form completed nearest to death more likely than earlier forms to have orders for no resuscitation and comfort measures only, although some later forms did have orders for more treatment.; CONCLUSION: More than half of POLST forms were completed in the final two months of life. Cause of death influenced when POLST forms were completed. POLST forms changed in the two years preceding death, more frequently recording fewer life-sustaining treatment orders than the earlier form(s).

AB The recent discovery that the interleukin 23/Th17 pathway is pivotal in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) creates new opportunities for the development of mechanistic biomarkers that will assist in the diagnosis and management of this disorder. While biomarkers are still in the discovery phase, new approaches including multiplex panels, fine sequencing of epigenetic and genetic data in non-coding regions of the human genome, and improved imaging modalities will likely foster the development of actionable biomarkers in PsA. In this report, I review the field of biomarkers, underscore the importance of an integrative approach that incorporates both descriptive and mechanistic biomarkers, and discuss the status of biomarker discovery in PsA.

AB OBJECTIVES: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms in the realm of clinical molecular diagnostics provides multigene mutational profiling through massively parallel sequencing.; METHODS: We analyzed 415 breast carcinoma samples from 354 patients using NGS in known hotspots of 46 commonly known cancer-causing genes.; RESULTS: A total of 281 somatic nonsynonymous mutations were detected in 62.1% of patients. TP53 was most frequently mutated (38.8%), followed by PIK3CA (31.7%), AKT1 (6%), and ATM (3.9%), with other mutations detected at a lower frequency. When stratified into clinically relevant therapeutic groups (estrogen receptor [ER]/progesterone receptor [PR]+ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-, ER/PR+HER2+, ER/PR-HER2+, ER/PR/HER2-), each group showed distinct mutational profiles. The ER/PR+HER2- tumors (n = 132) showed the highest frequency of PIK3CA mutations (38%), while the triple-negative tumors (n = 64) had a significantly higher number of TP53 mutations (62%). Of the 61 patients tested for both primary and metastatic tumors, concordant results were seen in 47 (77%) patients, while 13 patients showed additional mutations in the metastasis.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that breast cancers may harbor potentially actionable mutations for targeted therapeutics. Therefore, NGS-based mutational profiling can provide useful information that can guide targeted cancer therapy. Copyright© by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.

AB Public interest in personal whole genome sequencing is increasing. The technology is publicly available and is being used as an educational tool in higher education. Empirical evidence regarding its utility is vital. The goals of this study were to characterize the process of whole genome sequencing in a population of medical and basic science professionals undergoing whole genome sequencing as a part of an educational symposium. Thirty-eight individuals completed one or more surveys from the time of informed consent for whole genome sequencing to 3 months post-symposium. The four surveys assessed demographics, decision-making, communication, decision regret, and personal and professional impact. The most prevalent motivation to participate was professional enhancement, followed by curiosity about the technology, and personal health benefits. The most important initial impact concerned medical implications. Over time, however, impact on professional development was greater than on personal health. Anticipated reactions to receiving whole genome sequencing results generally matched participants' actual reactions and decision regret remained low over time. Benefits and risks of whole genome sequencing included medically actionable results and misunderstanding by healthcare providers. Whole genome sequencing generally had a positive impact professionally and personally on participants. Further education of providers and the public about whole genome sequencing and psychosocial support is warranted. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Increasing recognition of the role and value of theory in improvement work in healthcare offers the prospect of capitalising upon, and consolidating, actionable lessons from synthesis of improvement projects and initiatives. We propose that informed use of theory can (i) provide a mechanism by which to collect and organise data from a body of improvement work, (ii) offer a framework for analysis and identification of lessons learnt and (iii) facilitate an evaluation of the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of improvement programmes. Improvement practitioners can benefit from using an underpinning external structure as a lens by which to examine the specific achievements of their own projects alongside comparable initiatives led by others. We demonstrate the utility of a method known as 'best fit framework synthesis' (BFFS) in offering a ubiquitous and versatile means by which to collect, analyse and evaluate improvement work in healthcare. First reported in 2011, BFFS represents a pragmatic, flexible approach to integrating theory with findings from practice. A deductive phase, where a review team seeks to accommodate a substantial part of the data, is followed by an inductive phase, in which the team explores data not accommodated by the framework. We explore the potential for BFFS within improvement work by drawing upon the evidence synthesis methodology literature and practical examples of improvement work reported in BMJ Quality and Safety (2011-2015). We suggest four variants of BFFS that may have particular value in synthesising a body of improvement work. We conclude that BFFS, alongside other approaches that seek to optimise the contribution of theory to improvement work, represents one important enabling mechanism by which to establish the rigour and scientific credentials of the emerging discipline of 'improvement science'.

AB The discovery of actionable driver mutations such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and microtubule-associated protein-like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) and their highly responses to EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allowed precise medicine into reality. However, a substantial part of patients still have no sufficient tissue to perform genomic analysis. As a promising noninvasive biomarker and potential surrogate for the entire tumor genome, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been applied to the detection of driver gene mutations and epigenetic alteration and monitoring of tumor burden, acquired resistance, tumor heterogeneity and early diagnosis. Since precise therapy is a strategy that optimal therapy is decided based on simultaneous tumor genome information, ctDNA, as a liquid biopsy, may help to perform dynamic genetic surveillance. In this paper we will perspectively discuss the biology and identification of ctDNA in the blood of NSCLC patients and its clinical applications in patient management.

AB PURPOSE: To retrospectively investigate the reasons for and features of undiagnosed cancers at previous supplemental screening ultrasonography (US) in women who subsequently received a diagnosis of breast cancer.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement to obtain informed patient consent. The study consisted of 230 women (median age, 49 years; age range, 29-81 years) with 230 pairs of US examinations (prior and subsequent examinations) performed between December 2003 and August 2013 who were found to have cancer (median interval, 12 months; range, 2-24 months). The authors compared the clinical-pathologic features of patients with negative findings on prior images with those of patients with visible findings on prior images. Findings visible at prior US were classified as actionable or underthreshold by means of a blinded review by five radiologists. Lesions classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 4 or 5 by fewer than three readers were determined to be underthreshold. Reasons for undiagnosed cancers and their imaging features were analyzed.; RESULTS: Among the 230 prior US examinations, 72 (31.3%) showed visible findings and 158 (68.7%) showed negative findings. High-nuclear-grade cancers and triple-negative cancers were more common in patients with negative findings than in those with visible findings (P = .023 and P = .006, respectively). Blinded review revealed that 57 of the 72 visible findings (79%) were actionable. Misinterpretation (39% [28 of 72 lesions]) and multiple distracting lesions (17% [12 of 72 lesions]) were the two most common reasons for missing these actionable findings, which showed more noncircumscribed margins than did underthreshold findings (P = .028).; CONCLUSION: At supplemental screening breast US, close attention should be paid to the presence of a margin that is not circumscribed, and multiple lesions should be separately assessed to reduce the number of missed breast cancers. © RSNA, 2015

AB PURPOSE: This study aims to illustrate the potential utility of open-ended survey data, regarding faculty and staff perceptions of a culture of health (CoH), for targeting communications and programming. Overall, these types of data show how they may be used to assist in implementing, improving, and sustaining a CoH in an organization. Design/method/approach. An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to 10,000 employees. The analysis of open-ended responses was performed using the grounded theory approach. Emerging themes were organized into two major categories: favorable perceptions and unfavorable perceptions regarding the university's CoH.; FINDINGS: These findings suggest that employees have specific favorable and unfavorable perceptions regarding their university's CoH. Two main favorable perceptions that both faculty and staff commented on were (1) leaders/supervisors showing interest in health and well-being and (2) colleagues participating in healthful behaviors and setting good examples. Examples of unfavorable perceptions include stress not adequately addressed and healthy food options not readily available. Research limitations. The generalizability of the findings may be somewhat challenging given that the analyses are limited to individuals from a large Midwestern university. Also, given that this survey was voluntary, participants in the survey may possess unique characteristics that may have played a role in their likelihood to participate.; ORIGINALITY/VALUE: There are few studies that address assessing a CoH in a university setting. This study provides examples of (1) topics to consider when evaluating an organization's CoH and (2) actionable intervention and communication strategies that account for the employee's perceptions. Others might use such examples when evaluating or preparing to assess their own organization's CoH. © 2014 Society for Public Health Education.

AB This article describes the development of a theater script derived from a critical ethnographic study that followed people living with dementia--and their family and professional caregivers--over an 18-month period. Analysis of the ethnographic data yielded four themes that characterized home-based dementia care relationships: managing care resources, making care decisions, evaluating care practices, and reifying care norms. The research team expanded to include a colleague with playwright experience, who used these themes to write a script. A theater director was included to cast and direct the play, and finally, a videography company filmed the actors on a realistic set. To contribute to the qualitative health research and the research-based theater knowledge translation literatures, this article describes and explains the creative decisions taken as part of our effort to disseminate research focused on home-based dementia care in a way that catalyzes and fosters critical (actionable) dialogue. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB Treatment options for patients with brain metastases (BMs) have limited efficacy and the mortality rate is virtually 100%. Targeted therapy is critically under-utilized, and our understanding of mechanisms underpinning metastatic outgrowth in the brain is limited. To address these deficiencies, we investigated the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of 36 BMs from breast, lung, melanoma and oesophageal cancers, using DNA copy-number analysis and exome- and RNA-sequencing. The key findings were as follows. (a) Identification of novel candidates with possible roles in BM development, including the significantly mutated genes DSC2, ST7, PIK3R1 and SMC5, and the DNA repair, ERBB-HER signalling, axon guidance and protein kinase-A signalling pathways. (b) Mutational signature analysis was applied to successfully identify the primary cancer type for two BMs with unknown origins. (c) Actionable genomic alterations were identified in 31/36 BMs (86%); in one case we retrospectively identified ERBB2 amplification representing apparent HER2 status conversion, then confirmed progressive enrichment for HER2-positivity across four consecutive metastatic deposits by IHC and SISH, resulting in the deployment of HER2-targeted therapy for the patient. (d) In the ERBB/HER pathway, ERBB2 expression correlated with ERBB3 (r(2) = 0.496; p < 0.0001) and HER3 and HER4 were frequently activated in an independent cohort of 167 archival BM from seven primary cancer types: 57.6% and 52.6% of cases were phospho-HER3(Y1222) or phospho-HER4(Y1162) membrane-positive, respectively. The HER3 ligands NRG1/2 were barely detectable by RNAseq, with NRG1 (8p12) genomic loss in 63.6% breast cancer-BMs, suggesting a microenvironmental source of ligand. In summary, this is the first study to characterize the genomic landscapes of BM. The data revealed novel candidates, potential clinical applications for genomic profiling of resectable BMs, and highlighted the possibility of therapeutically targeting HER3, which is broadly over-expressed and activated in BMs, independent of primary site and systemic therapy.

This novel system evaluates the morphologic features of the tumor and establishes patterns that are associated with a particular tumor behavior. Patients with pattern A EAC do not develop lymph node metastasis, and therefore avoiding lymph node resection in these patients should be considered. These patients also have stage I tumors and conservative surgery would be beneficial to decrease morbidity. Patients with pattern B tumors rarely show metastases to lymph nodes, only if there is lymphovascular invasion, whereas those with pattern C tumors would require aggressive treatment as most lymph node or distant metastases and recurrences were noted in patients with this tumor pattern. Combining this new risk stratification system with an algorithm that surgeons and oncologists could complement to other actionable data would result in a more conservative treatment plan in patients with a new diagnosis of invasive usual-type EAC, as opposed to the current more radical treatment plan. This risk stratification model significantly improves on conventionally used factors such as histologic type, grade, and stage to help manage patients with EAC and identify those in need for aggressive surgical management versus a more conservative approach.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Health policy makers aspire to achieve an HIV treatment 'cascade' in which diagnostic and treatment services are accessed early and routinely by HIV-infected individuals. However, migrants and highly mobile individuals are likely to interact with HIV treatment programs and the healthcare system in ways that reflect their movement through time and place, affecting their successful progression through the HIV treatment cascade. We review recent research that has examined the challenges in effective and sustained HIV treatment for migrants and mobile populations.; RECENT FINDINGS: Mobility is associated with increased risk of antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence, lost to follow-up, deterioration in CD4 count, HIV-related death, development of drug resistance and general noncontinuity of HIV care. Migrants' slow progression through the HIV treatment cascade can be attributed to feelings of confusion, helplessness; an inability to effectively communicate in the native language; poor knowledge about administrative or logistical requirements of the healthcare system; the possibility of deportation or expulsion based on the legal status of the undocumented migrant; fear of disclosure and social isolation from the exile or compatriot group. Travel or transition to the host country commonly makes it difficult for migrants to remain enrolled in ART programs and to maintain adherence to treatment.; SUMMARY: Existing public health systems fail to properly account for migration, and actionable knowledge of the health requirements of migrants is still lacking. A large body of research has shown that migrants are more likely to enter into the healthcare system late and are less likely to be retained at successive stages of the HIV treatment cascade. HIV-infected migrants are especially vulnerable to a wide range of social, economic and political factors that include a lack of direct access to healthcare services; exposure to difficult or oppressive work environments; the separation from family, friends and a familiar sociocultural environment. Realizing the full treatment and preventive benefits of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 strategy will require reaching all marginalized subpopulations of which migrants are a particularly large and important group.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) capabilities can affect therapeutic decisions in patients with complex, advanced, or refractory cancer. We report the feasibility of a tumor sequencing advisory board at a regional cancer center. Specimens were analyzed for approximately 2800 mutations in 50 genes. Outcomes of interest included tumor sequencing advisory board function and processes, timely discussion of results, and proportion of reports having potentially actionable mutations. NGS results were successfully generated for 15 patients, with median time from tissue processing to reporting of 11.6 days (range, 5 to 21 days), and presented at a biweekly multidisciplinary tumor sequencing advisory board. Attendance averaged 19 participants (range, 12 to 24) at 20 days after patient enrollment (range, 10 to 30 days). Twenty-seven (range, 1 to 4 per patient) potentially actionable mutations were detected in 11 of 15 patients: TP53 (n = 6), KRAS (n= 4), MET (n = 3), APC (n = 3), CDKN2A (n = 2), PTEN (n = 2), PIK3CA, FLT3, NRAS, VHL, BRAF, SMAD4, and ATM. The Hotspot Panel is now offered as a clinically available test at our institution. NGS results can be obtained by in-house high-throughput sequencing and reviewed in a multidisciplinary tumor sequencing advisory board in a clinically relevant manner. The essential components of a center for personalized cancer care can support clinical decisions outside the university.

AB BACKGROUND: The Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) model shows the interrelationship between health and learning and the potential for improving educational outcomes by improving health outcomes. However, current descriptions do not explain how to implement the model.; METHODS: The existing literature, including scientific articles, programmatic guidance, and publications by national agencies and organizations, was reviewed and synthesized to describe an overview of interrelatedness of learning and health and the 10 components of the WSCC model.; RESULTS: The literature suggests potential benefits of applying the WSCC model at the district and school level. But, the model lacks specific guidance as to how this might be made actionable. A collaborative approach to health and learning is suggested, including a 10-step systematic process to help schools and districts develop an action plan for improving health and education outcomes. Essential preliminary actions are suggested to minimize the impact of the challenges that commonly derail systematic planning processes and program implementation, such as lack of readiness, personnel shortages, insufficient resources, and competing priorities.; CONCLUSIONS: All new models require testing and evidence to confirm their value. District and schools will need to test this model and put plans into action to show that significant, substantial, and sustainable health and academic outcomes can be achieved. © 2015 The Authors.

AB To engage in purposeful behavior, it is important to make plans, which organize subsequent actions. Most studies of planning involve "look-ahead" puzzle tasks that are unrelated to personal goals. We developed a task to assess autobiographical planning, which involves the formulation of personal plans in response to real-world goals, and examined autobiographical planning in 63 adults during fMRI scanning. Autobiographical planning was found to engage the default network, including medial-temporal lobe and midline structures, and executive control regions in lateral pFC and parietal cortex and caudate. To examine how specific qualitative features of autobiographical plans modulate neural activity, we performed parametric modulation analyses. Ratings of plan detail, novelty, temporal distance, ease of plan formulation, difficulty in goal completion, and confidence in goal accomplishment were used as covariates in six hierarchical linear regression models. This modeling procedure removed shared variance among the ratings, allowing us to determine the independent relationship between ratings of interest and trial-wise BOLD signal. We found that specific autobiographical planning, describing a detailed, achievable, and actionable planning process for attaining a clearly envisioned future, recruited both default and frontoparietal brain regions. In contrast, abstract autobiographical planning, plans that were constructed from more generalized semantic or affective representations of a less tangible and distant future, involved interactions among default, sensory perceptual, and limbic brain structures. Specific qualities of autobiographical plans are important predictors of default and frontoparietal control network engagement during plan formation and reflect the contribution of mnemonic and executive control processes to autobiographical planning.

AB CONTEXT: Public health practitioners, policy makers, and researchers alike have called for more data on individual worker's perceptions about workplace environment, job satisfaction, and training needs for a quarter of a century. The Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) was created to answer that call.; OBJECTIVE: Characterize key components of the public health workforce, including demographics, workplace environment, perceptions about national trends, and perceived training needs.; DESIGN: A nationally representative survey of central office employees at state health agencies (SHAs) was conducted in 2014. Approximately 25,000 e-mail invitations to a Web-based survey were sent out to public health staff in 37 states, based on a stratified sampling approach. Balanced repeated replication weights were used to account for the complex sampling design.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10,246 permanently employed SHA central office employees participated in PH WINS (46% response rate).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceptions about training needs; workplace environment and job satisfaction; national initiatives and trends; and demographics.; RESULTS: Although the majority of staff said they were somewhat or very satisfied with their job (79%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 78-80), as well as their organization (65%; 95% CI, 64-66), more than 42% (95% CI, 41-43) were considering leaving their organization in the next year or retiring before 2020; 4% of those were considering leaving for another job elsewhere in governmental public health. The majority of public health staff at SHA central offices are female (72%; 95% CI, 71-73), non-Hispanic white (70%; 95% CI, 69-71), and older than 40 years (73%; 95% CI, 72-74). The greatest training needs include influencing policy development, preparing a budget, and training related to the social determinants of health.; CONCLUSIONS: PH WINS represents the first nationally representative survey of SHA employees. It holds significant potential to help answer previously unaddressed questions in public health workforce research and provides actionable findings for SHA leaders.

AB We propose an image stream mining method in which images arrive with contexts (metadata) and need to be processed in real time by the image mining system (IMS), which needs to make predictions and derive actionable intelligence from these streams. After extracting the features of the image by preprocessing, IMS determines online the classifier to use on the extracted features to make a prediction using the context of the image. A key challenge associated with stream mining is that the prediction accuracy of the classifiers is unknown, since the image source is unknown; thus, these accuracies need to be learned online. Another key challenge of stream mining is that learning can only be done by observing the true label, but this is costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we model the image stream mining problem as an active, online contextual experts problem, where the context of the image is used to guide the classifier selection decision. We develop an active learning algorithm and show that it achieves regret sublinear in the number of images that have been observed so far. To further illustrate and assess the performance of our proposed methods, we apply them to diagnose breast cancer from the images of cellular samples obtained from the fine needle aspirate of breast mass. Our findings show that very high diagnosis accuracy can be achieved by actively obtaining only a small fraction of true labels through surgical biopsies. Other applications include video surveillance and video traffic monitoring.

AB BACKGROUND: In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) the impact of urological symptoms on quality of life and daily activities is considerable. Yet, a substantial percentage of patients may not be urologically evaluated and thus fail to be treated concordantly. The 8-item Actionable questionnaire is a validated English screening tool for the detection of neurogenic bladder overactivity in MS. To enable the use of the 8-item Actionable in The Netherlands and Belgium we translated the questionnaire into the Dutch language and investigated the test-retest reliability and the concurrent validity of the Dutch version.; METHODS: The process of translating the English Actionable questionnaire into the Dutch language included forward translations and back-translations. Then, in an online observational study, MS patients completed the Dutch Actionable at Days 1 and 8, and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54-Items (MSQoL-54) and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Profile (MSIP) questionnaires at Day 1; the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was assessed by phone at Day 1. For assessment of the test-retest reliability Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the Day 1 and Day 8 Actionable scores was calculated. For assessment of the concurrent validity r values were calculated between the Day 1 Actionable score and the EDSS score, the Physical and Mental MSQoL-54 composites, and the MSIP domain and symptom disability scores.; RESULTS: ; STUDY POPULATION: N=141 (106 female, 35 male) (80 relapsing remitting, 48 progressive, 13 unknown), mean age 47.8 (standard deviation [SD] 10.4) years, mean EDSS score 4.7 (SD 1.8); 137 patients completed the Day 8 assessment. Pearson's r between Actionable scores Day 1 and Day 8: 0.85 (P<.0001). Pearson's r between Actionable score Day 1 and scores for EDSS 0.41 (P<0.0001), MSQoL-54 Physical -0.31 (P=0.0002), MSQoL-54 Mental -0.29 (P=0.0005), MSIP Excretion and Reproductive Functions 0.44 (P<0.0001), Muscle and Movement Functions 0.39 (P<.0001), Basic Movement Activities 0.37 (P<0.0001), Activities of Daily Living 0.32 (P<0.0001), Participation in Life Situations 0.29 (P=0.0006) and Mental Functions 0.20 (P=0.0189).; CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch version of the Actionable urological screening tool for MS shows a good test-retest reliability and a good concurrent validity with disabilities and HRQoL.

AB "Cancer 2015" is a longitudinal and prospective cohort. It is a phased study whose aim was to pilot recruiting 1000 patients during phase 1 to establish the feasibility of providing a population-based genomics cohort. Newly diagnosed adult patients with solid cancers, with residual tumour material for molecular genomics testing, were recruited into the cohort for the collection of a dataset containing clinical, molecular pathology, health resource use and outcomes data. 1685 patients have been recruited over almost 3 years from five hospitals. Thirty-two percent are aged between 61-70 years old, with a median age of 63 years. Diagnostic tumour samples were obtained for 90% of these patients for multiple parallel sequencing. Patients identified with somatic mutations of potentially "actionable" variants represented almost 10% of those tumours sequenced, while 42% of the cohort had no mutations identified. These genomic data were annotated with information such as cancer site, stage, morphology, treatment and patient outcomes and health resource use and cost. This cohort has delivered its main objective of establishing an upscalable genomics cohort within a clinical setting and in phase 2 aims to develop a protocol for how genomics testing can be used in real-time clinical decision-making, providing evidence on the value of precision medicine to clinical practice.

AB Selective neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which, counterintuitively, are often caused by mutations in widely expressed genes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathies, for which there are no effective therapies. A subtype of these diseases--CMT type 2D (CMT2D)--is caused by dominant mutations in GARS, encoding the ubiquitously expressed enzyme glycyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (GlyRS). Despite the broad requirement of GlyRS for protein biosynthesis in all cells, mutations in this gene cause a selective degeneration of peripheral axons, leading to deficits in distal motor function. How mutations in GlyRS (GlyRS(CMT2D)) are linked to motor neuron vulnerability has remained elusive. Here we report that GlyRS(CMT2D) acquires a neomorphic binding activity that directly antagonizes an essential signalling pathway for motor neuron survival. We find that CMT2D mutations alter the conformation of GlyRS, enabling GlyRS(CMT2D) to bind the neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) receptor. This aberrant interaction competitively interferes with the binding of the cognate ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Nrp1. Genetic reduction of Nrp1 in mice worsens CMT2D symptoms, whereas enhanced expression of VEGF improves motor function. These findings link the selective pathology of CMT2D to the neomorphic binding activity of GlyRS(CMT2D) that antagonizes the VEGF-Nrp1 interaction, and indicate that the VEGF-Nrp1 signalling axis is an actionable target for treating CMT2D.

AB BACKGROUND: The Actionable questionnaire is an 8-item tool to screen patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) for neurogenic bladder problems, identifying those patients who might benefit from urological referral and bladder-specific treatment. The original scoring yields a total score of 0 to 24 with cut-off point 6. A simplified scoring, yielding a total score of 0 to 8 with cut-off point 3, has been developed in urogynaecological patients, but has not been investigated in MS.; METHODS: One-hundred-and-forty-one MS patients completed the Actionable on two occasions. We compared the test performance of the simplified scoring with cut-off point 3 with that of cut-off point 2, using the original scoring with cut-off point 6 as a gold standard. The following measures were calculated: True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and Accuracy. The associations between positive test result and urological treatment, and bladder-specific drug treatment were calculated.; RESULTS: For cut-off point 3 the outcomes (Test 1, Test 2) were: TP 43.26 %, 40.88 %; TN 29.79 %, 32.85 %; FP 0.00 %, 0.00 %; FN 26.95 %, 26.28 %; Sensitivity 0.62, 0.61; Specificity 1.00, 1.00; PPV 1.00, 1.00; NPV 0.53, 0.55; Accuracy 0.73, 0.74; and for cut-off point 2: TP 59.57 %, 59.85 %; TN 26.95 %, 31.39 %; FP 2.84 %, 1.46 %; FN 10.63 %, 7.30 %; Sensitivity 0.85, 0.89; Specificity 0.90, 0.96; PPV 0.95, 0.98; NPV 0.72, 0.81; Accuracy 0.87, 0.91. Cut-off 3 completely prevented FP outcomes, but wrongly classified 26 % of the patients as negative (FN). Cut-off 2 reduced the FN to 7-10 %, with low FP values (2.84-1.46 %). With cut-off 2, the percentage of patients screened positive was higher in the Progressive group (75.00 %) than in the Relapsing Remitting group (56.25 %) (P = 0.0331), which was not the case with cut-off 3. Only a positive test according to the original scoring was associated with both urological treatment (P = 0.0119) and bladder-specific medication (P = 0.0328).; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in MS patients the simplified Actionable scoring is more accurate with cut-off point 2 than with cut-off point 3, especially by substantially reducing FN outcomes; and that in MS the original Actionable scoring seems preferable.

AB Current therapies for sarcomas are often inadequate. This study sought to identify actionable gene targets by selective targeting of the molecular networks that support sarcoma cell proliferation. Silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an amidotransferase that converts aspartate into asparagine, produced the strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma growth in a functional genomic screen of mouse sarcomas generated by oncogenic Kras and disruption of Cdkn2a. ASNS silencing in mouse and human sarcoma cell lines reduced the percentage of S phase cells and impeded new polypeptide synthesis. These effects of ASNS silencing were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine. Also, asparagine depletion via the ASNS inhibitor amino sulfoximine 5 (AS5) or asparaginase inhibited mouse and human sarcoma growth in vitro, and genetic silencing of ASNS in mouse sarcoma cells combined with depletion of plasma asparagine inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells may represent a metabolic vulnerability with potential anti-sarcoma therapeutic value.

AB BACKGROUND: While next-generation sequencing (NGS) costs have plummeted in recent years, cost and complexity of computation remain substantial barriers to the use of NGS in routine clinical care. The clinical potential of NGS will not be realized until robust and routine whole genome sequencing data can be accurately rendered to medically actionable reports within a time window of hours and at scales of economy in the 10's of dollars.; RESULTS: We take a step towards addressing this challenge, by using COSMOS, a cloud-enabled workflow management system, to develop GenomeKey, an NGS whole genome analysis workflow. COSMOS implements complex workflows making optimal use of high-performance compute clusters. Here we show that the Amazon Web Service (AWS) implementation of GenomeKey via COSMOS provides a fast, scalable, and cost-effective analysis of both public benchmarking and large-scale heterogeneous clinical NGS datasets.; CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic benchmarking reveals important new insights and considerations to produce clinical turn-around of whole genome analysis optimization and workflow management including strategic batching of individual genomes and efficient cluster resource configuration.

AB There is a need in surgical oncology for contrast agents that can enable real-time intraoperative visualization of solid tumors that can enable complete resections while sparing normal surrounding tissues. The Tumor Paint agent BLZ-100 is a peptide-fluorophore conjugate that can specifically bind solid tumors and fluoresce in the near-infrared range, minimizing light scatter and signal attenuation. In this study, we provide a preclinical proof of concept for use of this imaging contrast agent as administered before surgery to dogs with a variety of naturally occurring spontaneous tumors. Imaging was performed on excised tissues as well as intraoperatively in a subset of cases. Actionable contrast was achieved between tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissues in adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, mast cell tumors, and soft tissue sarcomas. Subcutaneous soft tissue sarcomas were labeled with the highest fluorescence intensity and greatest tumor-to-background signal ratio. Our results establish a foundation that rationalizes clinical studies in humans with soft tissue sarcoma, an indication with a notably high unmet need. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB After decades of discovery, inherited variations have been identified in approximately 20 genes that affect about 80 medications and are actionable in the clinic. And some somatically acquired genetic variants direct the choice of 'targeted' anticancer drugs for individual patients. Current efforts that focus on the processes required to appropriately act on pharmacogenomic variability in the clinic are moving away from discovery and towards implementation of an evidenced-based strategy for improving the use of medications, thereby providing a cornerstone for precision medicine.

AB Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million patients diagnosed annually. In late-stage colorectal cancer, the most commonly used targeted therapies are the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Recent studies have identified alterations in KRAS and other genes as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome in tumour graft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes. These analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluating response to targeted therapies in human cancer, highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapies, and delineate new avenues for intervention in managing colorectal cancer.

AB There is an unmet clinical need for molecularly directed therapies available for metastatic colorectal cancer. Comprehensive genomic profiling has the potential to identify actionable genomic alterations in colorectal cancer. Through comprehensive genomic profiling we prospectively identified 6 RET fusion kinases, including two novel fusions of CCDC6-RET and NCOA4-RET, in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. RET fusion kinases represent a novel class of oncogenic driver in CRC and occurred at a 0.2% frequency without concurrent driver mutations, including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA or other fusion tyrosine kinases. Multiple RET kinase inhibitors were cytotoxic to RET fusion kinase positive cancer cells and not RET fusion kinase negative CRC cells. The presence of a RET fusion kinase may identify a subset of metastatic CRC patients with a high response rate to RET kinase inhibition. This is the first characterization of RET fusions in CRC patients and highlights the therapeutic significance of prospective comprehensive genomic profiling in advanced CRC.

AB The clinical utility of liquid biopsy in cancer treatment will increase as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) analysis move from the enumeration to the real-time measurement of tumor characteristics. Intratumor heterogeneity is becoming increasingly recognized as a major drawback to the shift to personalized medicine. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity might be reflected by the serial assessment of CTCs. Indeed, the developing technologies for CTCs analysis now allow digital genomic and next-generation sequencing approaches, able to differentiate molecular subtypes of the disease and to monitor genetic variation over time. The liquid biopsy of cancer might offer a real-time assessment of tumor biology, providing the opportunity to serially evaluate patients most likely to benefit from targeted drugs based on a dynamic characterization of the disease at the molecular level. Although hurdles remain before liquid biopsy is seen in routine clinical practice, the information derived from CTCs may facilitate the real-time identification of actionable mutations in cancer leading the way toward personalized medicine.

AB There are many important research-practice gaps. Evidence to inform clinical decision-making is remarkably scant. A greater research focus on more clinically informative patient samples, clinically relevant questions, the use of innovative trial designs and analyses, and reporting of results in clinically understandable and potentially actionable ways can help reduce these gaps. Efforts to reduce intellectual silos, lessen the burden of research, and revise some academic incentives and publication practices would also be of help in reducing these gaps and hopefully improving patient care and outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: In solid organ transplantation, sensitive real-time biomarkers to assess the graft health are desirable to enable early intervention, for example, to avoid full-blown rejections. During rejection, high amounts of graft-derived cell-free DNA (GcfDNA) are shed into the blood stream. The quantification of this GcfDNA in allotransplantation is considered to fulfill this need, because it can be measured with great precision and at reasonable cost.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from 2 ongoing studies in kidney (KTx) and heart (HTx) transplantation were monitored blinded on a scheduled basis, by means of a published universal droplet digital polymerase chain reaction to quantify the GcfDNA.; RESULTS: Immediately after engraftment, GcfDNA reaches high values (>5% of total cfDNA), with a rapid decrease to values of<0.5% within 1 week. Living-related KTx recipients show lower initial values, reflecting the absence of preservation injury. Episodes of rejection in KTx and HTx are accompanied by a significant increase of GcfDNA (>5-fold) above values in patients without complications, occurring earlier than clinical or biochemical hints to rejection. One case of rejection, which became clinically suspect after 1 year and was proven with biopsy, showed a significant 10-fold increase 3 months earlier.; CONCLUSIONS: The quantification of GcfDNA has the potential to detect rejection episodes at early stages, when other means of diagnosis are not effective. The method's noninvasiveness enables the monitoring recipients at intervals that are desired to catch rejections at early actionable stages to prevent full-blown rejection. This biomarker will be particularly valuable in regimens to minimize immunosuppression. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Gastric and esophageal cancers represent a major global cancer burden and novel approaches are needed. Despite recent improvements in outcomes with trastuzumab and ramucirumab the prognosis for advanced disease remains poor, with a median overall survival of 1 year. Comprehensive genomic characterization has defined molecular subgroups and potentially actionable genomic alterations, but the majority of patients do not yet benefit from molecularly directed therapies. Breakthroughs in immune checkpoint blockade have provided new therapeutic avenues in melanoma, and continue to expand into other tumor types, with ongoing investigations in gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. The frequency of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) overexpression, a putative response biomarker, approaches forty percent in gastric cancers. Translational studies and molecular classification suggest gastric and esophageal cancers are candidate malignancies for immune checkpoint inhibition trials and early clinical data is promising. Here we review the mechanisms, preclinical, and early clinical data supporting the role for immune checkpoint blockade in gastric and esophageal cancer.

AB Deconvoluting the molecular target signals behind observed drug response phenotypes is an important part of phenotype-based drug discovery and repurposing efforts. We demonstrate here how our network-based deconvolution approach, named target addiction score (TAS), provides insights into the functional importance of druggable protein targets in cell-based drug sensitivity testing experiments. Using cancer cell line profiling data sets, we constructed a functional classification across 107 cancer cell models, based on their common and unique target addiction signatures. The pan-cancer addiction correlations could not be explained by the tissue of origin, and only correlated in part with molecular and genomic signatures of the heterogeneous cancer cells. The TAS-based cancer cell classification was also shown to be robust to drug response data resampling, as well as predictive of the transcriptomic patterns in an independent set of cancer cells that shared similar addiction signatures with the 107 cancers. The critical protein targets identified by the integrated approach were also shown to have clinically relevant mutation frequencies in patients with various cancer subtypes, including not only well-established pan-cancer genes, such as PTEN tumor suppressor, but also a number of targets that are less frequently mutated in specific cancer types, including ABL1 oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia. An application to leukemia patient primary cell models demonstrated how the target deconvolution approach offers functional insights into patient-specific addiction patterns, such as those indicative of their receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status and co-addiction partners, which may lead to clinically actionable, personalized drug treatment developments. To promote its application to the future drug testing studies, we have made available an open-source implementation of the TAS calculation in the form of a stand-alone Rpackage.  © 2015.

AB IMPORTANCE: The practice of genetic testing for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) is rapidly evolving owing to the recent introduction of multigene panels. While these tests may identify 40% to 50% more individuals with hereditary cancer gene mutations than does testing for BRCA1/2 alone, whether finding such mutations will alter clinical management is unknown.; OBJECTIVE: To define the potential clinical effect of multigene panel testing for HBOC in a clinically representative cohort.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study of patients seen between 2001 and 2014 in 3 large academic medical centers. We prospectively enrolled 1046 individuals who were appropriate candidates for HBOC evaluation and who lacked BRCA1/2 mutations.; INTERVENTIONS: We carried out multigene panel testing on all participants, then determined the clinical actionability, if any, of finding non-BRCA1/2 mutations in these and additional comparable individuals.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated the likelihood of (1) a posttest management change and (2) an indication for additional familial testing, considering gene-specific consensus management guidelines, gene-associated cancer risks, and personal and family history.; RESULTS: Among 1046 study participants, 40 BRCA1/2-negative patients (3.8%; 95% CI, 2.8%-5.2%) harbored deleterious mutations, most commonly in moderate-risk breast and ovarian cancer genes (CHEK2, ATM, and PALB2) and Lynch syndrome genes. Among these and an additional 23 mutation-positive individuals enrolled from our clinics, most of the mutations (92%) were consistent with the spectrum of cancer(s) observed in the patient or family, suggesting that these results are clinically significant. Among all 63 mutation-positive patients, additional disease-specific screening and/or prevention measures beyond those based on personal and family history alone would be considered for most (33 [52%] of 63; 95% CI, 40.3%-64.2%). Furthermore, additional familial testing would be considered for those with first-degree relatives (42 [72%] of 58; 95% CI, 59.8%-82.2%) based on potential management changes for mutation-positive relatives. This clinical effect was not restricted to a few of the tested genes because most identified genes could change clinical management for some patients.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a clinically representative cohort, multigene panel testing for HBOC risk assessment yielded findings likely to change clinical management for substantially more patients than does BRCA1/2 testing alone. Multigene testing in this setting is likely to alter near-term cancer risk assessment and management recommendations for mutation-affected individuals across a broad spectrum of cancer predisposition genes.

AB Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal-recessive disorder associated with pathogenic HFE variants, most commonly those resulting in p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp. Recommendations on returning incidental findings of HFE variants in individuals undergoing genome-scale sequencing should be informed by penetrance estimates of HH in unselected samples. We used the eMERGE Network, a multicenter cohort with genotype data linked to electronic medical records, to estimate the diagnostic rate and clinical penetrance of HH in 98 individuals homozygous for the variant coding for HFE p.Cys282Tyr and 397 compound heterozygotes with variants resulting in p.[His63Asp];[Cys282Tyr]. The diagnostic rate of HH in males was 24.4% for p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and 3.5% for compound heterozygotes (p < 0.001); in females, it was 14.0% for p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and 2.3% for compound heterozygotes (p < 0.001). Only males showed differences across genotypes in transferrin saturation levels (100% of homozygotes versus 37.5% of compound heterozygotes with transferrin saturation > 50%; p = 0.003), serum ferritin levels (77.8% versus 33.3% with serum ferritin > 300ng/ml; p = 0.006), and diabetes (44.7% versus 28.0%; p = 0.03). No differences were found in the prevalence of heart disease, arthritis, or liver disease, except for the rate of liver biopsy (10.9% versus 1.8% [p = 0.013] in males; 9.1% versus 2% [p = 0.035] in females). Given the higher rate of HH diagnosis than in prior studies, the high penetrance of iron overload, and the frequency of at-risk genotypes, in addition to other suggested actionable adult-onset genetic conditions, opportunistic screening should be considered for p.[Cys282Tyr];[Cys282Tyr] individuals with existing genomic data.

AB Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC) organized the 9th IRIC International Symposium on 14-15 May, 2015. The symposium was held at the IRIC, an ultra-modern research hub and training center located on the hilltop of the Universite de Montreal campus in Montreal, Canada. This year's title was 'Molecular Targets in Cancer Genomics', reflecting the common interest of the IRIC student community. Through four broadly themed sessions, organizers sought to highlight the new generation of anti-cancer strategies including targeted therapies directed against actionable cancer-specific mutations, and immunotherapies, which enhance immune responses against cancer. Both targeted and immunotherapies are tailored to cancer-specific features, and require precise knowledge of cancer cells, from their genome to their proteome. The focus of this symposium was on translating the molecular basis of cancer into a functional understanding of aberrant pathways, and to uncover novel targets to be exploited for cancer therapeutic strategies.  © 2015.

AB The application of modern molecular tests such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) to human malignancies has led to better understanding of tumor biology and the design of targeted molecular therapies. In the research setting, important genomic alterations in tumors have been discovered with potential therapeutic implications but data regarding the impact of this technology in a real world oncology practice is limited. As a result, we decided to review the results of NGS in 144 advanced-stage cancer patients referred to the oncology practices of Lifespan-affiliated centers in Rhode Island. Most cancers revealed genomic alterations in genes commonly mutated in cancer. However, several unexpected genomic alterations were discovered in certain cancers with potential therapeutic intervention. Most cancers contained "actionable" genomic alterations despite being of advanced stage. Our experience demonstrates that application of NGS in the clinical setting contributes both to increasing the therapeutic armamentarium as well as our understanding of tumor biology.

AB Personalized oncology, or more aptly precision oncogenomics, refers to the identification and implementation of clinically actionable targets tailored to an individual patient's cancer genomic information. Banking of human tissue and other biospecimens establishes a framework to extract and collect the data essential to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and treatment. Cancer cooperative groups in the United States have led the way in establishing robust biospecimen collection mechanisms to facilitate translational research, and combined with technological advances in molecular testing, tissue banking has expanded from its traditional base in academic research and is assuming an increasingly pivotal role in directing the clinical care of cancer patients. Comprehensive screening of tumors by DNA sequencing and the ability to mine and interpret these large data sets from well-organized tissue banks have defined molecular subtypes of cancer. Such stratification by genomic criteria has revolutionized our perspectives on cancer diagnosis and treatment, offering insight into prognosis, progression, and susceptibility or resistance to known therapeutic agents. In turn, this has enabled clinicians to offer treatments tailored to patients that can greatly improve their chances of survival. Unique challenges and opportunities accompany the rapidly evolving interplay between tissue banking and genomic sequencing, and are the driving forces underlying the revolution in precision medicine. Molecular testing and precision medicine clinical trials are now becoming the major thrust behind the cooperative groups' clinical research efforts.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Using the thoracic morbidity and mortality classification to document all postoperative adverse events between October 2012 and February 2014, we created surgeon-specific outcome reports (SSORs) to promote self-assessment and to implement a divisional continuous quality improvement (CQI) program, on the construct of positive deviance, to improve individual surgeon's clinical performance.; METHODS: Mixed-methods study within a division of six thoracic surgeons, involving (1) development of real-time, Web-based, risk-adjusted SSORs; (2) implementation of CQI seminars (n= 6; September 2013 to June 2014) for evaluation of results, collegial discussion on quality improvement based on identification of positive outliers, and selection of quality indicators for future discussion; and (3) in-person interviews to identify facilitators and barriers to using SSORs and CQI. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis.; RESULTS: Interviews revealed enthusiastic support for SSORs as a means to improve patient care through awareness of personal outcomes with blinded divisional comparison for similar operations and diseases, and apply the learning objectives to continuous professional development and maintenance of certification. Perceived limitations of SSORs included difficulty measuring surgeon expertise, limited understanding of risk adjustment, resistance to change, and belief that knowledge of sensitive data could lead to punitive actions. All surgeons believed CQI seminars led to collegial discussions, whereas perceived limitations included quorum participation and failing to circle back on actionable items.; CONCLUSIONS: Real-time performance feedback using SSORs can motivate surgeons to improve their practice, and CQI seminars offer the opportunity to review and interpret results and address issues in a supportive environment. Whether SSORs and CQI can lead to improvements in rates of postoperative adverse events is a matter of ongoing research. Copyright © 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to document the clinical impact of CT in elderly patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain.; METHODS: This retrospective IRB-approved study from 2006 to 2013 evaluated 464 patients ≥80years (mean 89years, range 80-100: M150, W314), who presented to the ED with acute abdominal symptoms and underwent CT. CTs were divided into those negative and positive for actionable findings, defined as potentially requiring a change in surgical or medical management. Physician diagnosis, treatment plan, and disposition before and after CT were reviewed in the electronic medical record to assess CT influence on management and disposition. CT diagnosis was confirmed with final clinical diagnosis, surgical intervention, pathology, and follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used.; RESULTS: CTs were positive in 55%. The most common diagnoses were SBO (18%), diverticulitis (9%), non-ischemic vascular-related emergency (6%), bowel ischemia (4%), appendicitis (3%), and colonic obstruction (2%). These diagnoses were clinically unsuspected prior to CT in 43% (p<0.05), with significant difficultly in diagnosing SBO (p<0.05), diverticulitis (p<0.01), and colonic obstruction (p<0.01). Positive CT results influenced treatment plans in 65%, surgical in 48%, and medical in 52%. Disposition from the ED was significantly affected by CT (p<0.001), 65% of admissions with positive CT (p<0.001) and 63% of discharges with negative CT (p<0.001).; CONCLUSION: Utilization of abdominopelvic CT in geriatric patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal symptoms strongly influences clinical management and significantly affects disposition. As the US population ages, the clinical impact of emergent CT in the elderly will intensify.

AB Given the success of targeted agents in specific populations it is expected that some degree of molecular biomarker testing will become standard of care for many, if not all, cancers. To facilitate this, cancer centers worldwide are experimenting with targeted "panel" sequencing of selected mutations. Recent advances in genomic technology enable the generation of genome-scale data sets for individual patients. Recognizing the risk, inherent in panel sequencing, of failing to detect meaningful somatic alterations, we sought to establish processes to integrate data from whole-genome analysis (WGA) into routine cancer care. Between June 2012 and August 2014, 100 adult patients with incurable cancers consented to participate in the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) study. Fresh tumor and blood samples were obtained and used for whole-genome and RNA sequencing. Computational approaches were used to identify candidate driver mutations, genes, and pathways. Diagnostic and drug information were then sought based on these candidate "drivers." Reports were generated and discussed weekly in a multidisciplinary team setting. Other multidisciplinary working groups were assembled to establish guidelines on the interpretation, communication, and integration of individual genomic findings into patient care. Of 78 patients for whom WGA was possible, results were considered actionable in 55 cases. In 23 of these 55 cases, the patients received treatments motivated by WGA. Our experience indicates that a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists can implement a paradigm in which WGA is integrated into the care of late stage cancer patients to inform systemic therapy decisions.

AB The positive rate of head CT in non-trauma patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) is low. Currently, indications for imaging are based on the individual experience of the treating physician, which contributes to overutilization and variability in imaging utilization. The goals of this study are to ascertain the predictors of positive head CT in non-trauma patients and demonstrate feasibility of a clinical scoring algorithm to improve yield. We retrospectively reviewed 500 consecutive ED non-trauma patients evaluated with non-contrast head CT after presenting with headache, altered mentation, syncope, dizziness, or focal neurologic deficit. Medical records were assessed for clinical risk factors: focal neurologic deficit, altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, known malignancy, coagulopathy, and age. Data was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and three derived algorithms. Positive CTs were found in 51 of 500 patients (10.2%). Only two clinical factors were significant: focal neurologic deficit (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 20.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4-45.7) and age >55 (adjusted OR 3.08; CI 1.44-6.56). Area under the ROC curve for all three algorithms was 0.73-0.83. In proposed algorithm C, only patients with focal neurologic deficit (major risk factor) or ≥2 of the five minor risk factors (altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, known malignancy, coagulopathy, and age) would undergo CT imaging. This may reduce utilization by 34% with only a small decrease in sensitivity (98%). Our simple scoring algorithm utilizing multiple clinical risk factors could help to predict the non-trauma patients who will benefit from CT imaging, resulting in reduced radiation exposure without sacrificing sensitivity.

AB BACKGROUND: Several subsets of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are defined by molecular alterations acting as tumor drivers, some of them being currently therapeutically actionable. The rat sarcoma (RAS)-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway constitutes an attractive potential target, as v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutations occur in 2-4% of NSCLC adenocarcinoma.; METHODS: Here, we review the latest clinical data on BRAF serine/threonine kinase inhibitors in NSCLC.; RESULTS: Treatment of V600E BRAF-mutated NSCLC with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity. Combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors using dabrafenib and trametinib is under evaluation. Preliminary data suggest superior efficacy compared with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy.; CONCLUSION: Targeting BRAF alterations represents a promising new therapeutic approach for a restricted subset of oncogene-addicted NSCLC. Prospect ive trials refining this strategy are ongoing. A next step will probably aim at combining BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapy or alternatively improve a multilevel mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway blockade by combining with ERK inhibitors.

AB In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), oncogenic autophagy dependent on microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha and beta (LC3A and LC3B) is stimulated by activity of the transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channel through multiple complementary mechanisms. The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor represses this oncogenic autophagy in a coordinated manner through the activity of miR-204, which is expressed from intron 6 of the gene encoding TRPM3. TRPM3 represents an actionable target for ccRCC treatment.

AB High throughput sequencing has facilitated a precipitous drop in the cost of genomic sequencing, prompting predictions of a revolution in medicine via genetic personalization of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. There are significant barriers to realizing this goal that are related to the difficult task of interpreting personal genetic variation. A comprehensive, widely accessible application for interpretation of whole genome sequence data is needed. Here, we present a series of methods for identification of genetic variants and genotypes with clinical associations, phasing genetic data and using Mendelian inheritance for quality control, and providing predictive genetic information about risk for rare disease phenotypes and response to pharmacological therapy in single individuals and father-mother-child trios. We demonstrate application of these methods for disease and drug response prognostication in whole genome sequence data from twelve unrelated adults, and for disease gene discovery in one father-mother-child trio with apparently simplex congenital ventricular arrhythmia. In doing so we identify clinically actionable inherited disease risk and drug response genotypes in pre-symptomatic individuals. We also nominate a new candidate gene in congenital arrhythmia, ATP2B4, and provide experimental evidence of a regulatory role for variants discovered using this framework.

AB OBJECTIVES: The intensivist-led model of ICU care requires surgical consultants and the ICU team to collaborate in the care of ICU patients and to communicate effectively across teams. We sought to characterize communication between intensivists and surgeons and to assess enablers and barriers of effective communication.; DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. An inductive data analysis approach was taken.; SETTING: Seven intensivist-led ICUs in four academic hospitals.; SUBJECTS: Surgeons (attendings and residents), intensivists (attendings and residents), and ICU nurses participating in the care of surgical patients in the ICU.; INTERVENTIONS: None.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Communication enablers and barriers existed at two distinct levels: 1) organizational and 2) cultural. At an organizational level, participants identified that formally sanctioned communication structures and processes often acted as barriers to communication. Participants had developed informal strategies to improve communication. At a cultural level, surgical and ICU participants often expressed conflicting perspectives regarding patient ownership, scope of practice, and clinical expertise.; CONCLUSIONS: Major barriers to optimal communication between surgical and ICU teams exist in the intensivist-led ICU environment. Many are related to the structures and processes meant to facilitate communication across teams and others to how some aspects of care in the ICU are conceptualized. Multiple actionable opportunities exist to improve communication in the intensivist-led ICU.

AB Many variants that could be returned from genome sequencing may be perceived as ambiguous-lacking reliability, credibility, or adequacy. Little is known about how perceived ambiguity influences thoughts about sequencing results. Participants (n=494) in an NIH genome sequencing study completed a baseline survey before sequencing results were available. We examined how perceived ambiguity regarding sequencing results and individual differences in medical ambiguity aversion and tolerance for uncertainty were associated with cognitions and intentions concerning sequencing results. Perceiving sequencing results as more ambiguous was associated with less favorable cognitions about results and lower intentions to learn and share results. Among participants low in tolerance for uncertainty or optimism, greater perceived ambiguity was associated with lower intentions to learn results for non-medically actionable diseases; medical ambiguity aversion did not moderate any associations. Results are consistent with the phenomenon of "ambiguity aversion" and may influence whether people learn and communicate genomic information.

AB BACKGROUND: Treatment of IBS and functional lower gastrointestinal disorders is still based predominantly on symptoms; biomarkers that reflect the mechanism or pathophysiology have been identified. Given the diverse mechanisms that result in the same clinical phenotype of IBS, it is hypothesised that identification of biomarkers may lead to individualisation of medical therapy.; AIM: To review the biomarkers that have been appraised in IBS.; METHODS: A single author reviewed the published literature on biomarkers appraised in IBS.; RESULTS: The current literature suggests that these biomarkers are insufficiently sensitive or specific to differentiate IBS from health or from other diseases causing similar symptoms, such as coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Most of the proposed biomarkers are not actionable, that is, they do not lead to an efficacious therapy based on the biological inference of the biomarker itself. However, among proposed biomarkers in IBS, some are actionable, as they specifically reflect a quantitative difference in a mediator of dysfunction or result in a quantifiable disturbance of function that can be specifically treated. Such biomarkers may potentially identify relevant subgroups that respond to specific therapy. The most promising actionable biomarkers are measurement of colonic transit (leading to treatments that reverse the abnormal transit) and measurements of bile acid diarrhoea to identify responders to bile acid sequestrants.; CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, although biomarkers are not ready for prime time as diagnostic tests in IBS, some biomarkers could identify subgroups of patients with IBS for inclusion in clinical trials that target specific dysfunctions. Such an approach may enhance treatment efficacy, and may ultimately help reduce costs in drug development and in the management of patients in clinical practice. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The integration of Big Data from electronic health records and other information systems within and across health care enterprises provides an opportunity to develop actionable predictive models that can increase the confidence of nursing leaders' decisions to improve patient outcomes and safety and control costs. As health care shifts to the community, mobile health applications add to the Big Data available. There is an evolving national action plan that includes nursing data in Big Data science, spearheaded by the University of Minnesota School of Nursing. For the past 3 years, diverse stakeholders from practice, industry, education, research, and professional organizations have collaborated through the "Nursing Knowledge: Big Data Science" conferences to create and act on recommendations for inclusion of nursing data, integrated with patient-generated, interprofessional, and contextual data. It is critical for nursing leaders to understand the value of Big Data science and the ways to standardize data and workflow processes to take advantage of newer cutting edge analytics to support analytic methods to control costs and improve patient quality and safety.

AB While the cost of whole genome sequencing (WGS) is approaching the realm of routine medical tests, it remains too tardy to help guide the management of many acute medical conditions. Rapid WGS is imperative in light of growing evidence of its utility in acute care, such as in diagnosis of genetic diseases in very ill infants, and genotype-guided choice of chemotherapy at cancer relapse. In such situations, delayed, empiric, or phenotype-based clinical decisions may meet with substantial morbidity or mortality. We previously described a rapid WGS method, STATseq, with a sensitivity of >96% for nucleotide variants that allowed a provisional diagnosis of a genetic disease in 50h. Here improvements in sequencing run time, read alignment, and variant calling are described that enable 26-h time to provisional molecular diagnosis with >99.5% sensitivity and specificity of genotypes. STATseq appears to be an appropriate strategy for acutely ill patients with potentially actionable genetic diseases.

AB The so called "Triple Negative Breast Cancer" (TNBC) represents approximately 15-20% of breast cancers. This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. Despite this unambiguous definition, TNBCs are an heterogeneous group of tumours with just one common clinical feature: a distinctly aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because of the absence of well-defined molecular targets, cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for TNBC. In the last decades, the use of more aggressive chemotherapy has produced a clear improvement of the prognosis in women with TNBC, but this approach results in an unacceptable deterioration in the quality of life, also if some support therapies try to relieve patients from distress. In addition, there is the general belief that it is impossible to further improve the prognosis of TNBC patients with chemotherapy alone. In view of that, there is a feverish search for new "clever drugs" able both to rescue chemo-resistant, and to reduce the burden of chemotherapy in chemo-responsive TNBC patients. A major obstacle to identifying actionable targets in TNBC is the vast disease heterogeneity both inter-tumour and intra-tumour and years of study have failed to demonstrate a single unifying alteration that is targetable in TNBC. TNBC is considered the subtype that best benefits from the neoadjuvant model, since the strong correlation between pathological Complete Response and long-term Disease-Free-Survival in these patients. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of TNBC, with a focus on the subtyping of TNBC. We also explore the implications of these discoveries for future treatments and highlight the need for a completely different type of clinical trials.

AB Recently, MET exon 14 deletion (METex14del) has been postulated to be one potential mechanism for MET protein overexpression. We screened for the presence of METex14del transcript by multiplexed fusion transcript analysis using nCounter assay followed by confirmation with quantitative reverse transcription PCR with correlation to MET protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MET amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We extracted RNAs from 230 patients enrolled onto the prospective molecular profiling clinical trial (NEXT-1) (NCT02141152) between November 2013 and August 2014. Thirteen METex14del cases were identified including 3 gastric cancer, 4 colon cancer, 5 non-small cell lung cancer, and one adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. Of these 13 METex14del cases, 11 were MET IHC 3+ and 2 were 2+. Only one out of the 13 METex14del cases was MET amplified (MET/CEP ratio > 2.0). Growths of two (gastric, colon) METex14del+ patient tumor derived cell lines were profoundly inhibited by both MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a monoclonal antibody targeting MET. In conclusion, METex14del is a unique molecular aberration present in gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies corresponding with overexpression of MET protein but rarely with MET amplification. Substantial growth inhibition of METex14del+ patient tumor derived cell lines by several MET targeting drugs strongly suggests METex14del is a potential actionable driver mutation in GI malignancies.

AB Here, we evaluate the mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits in Drosophila and mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). We find that lysosomes promote the growth of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) via Rag GTPases and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1). However, rather than employing S6K/4E-BP1, MTORC1 stimulates NMJ growth via JNK, a determinant of axonal growth in Drosophila and mammals. This role of lysosomal function in regulating JNK phosphorylation is conserved in mammals. Despite requiring the amino-acid-responsive kinase MTORC1, NMJ development is insensitive to dietary protein. We attribute this paradox to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which restricts neuronal amino acid uptake, and the administration of an ALK inhibitor couples NMJ development to dietary protein. Our findings provide an explanation for the neurodevelopmental deficits in LSDs and suggest an actionable target for treatment.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We report unbiased metagenomic detection of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from four human blood samples by MinION nanopore sequencing coupled to a newly developed, web-based pipeline for real-time bioinformatics analysis on a computational server or laptop (MetaPORE). At titers ranging from 10(7)-10(8) copies per milliliter, reads to EBOV from two patients with acute hemorrhagic fever and CHIKV from an asymptomatic blood donor were detected within 4 to 10 min of data acquisition, while lower titer HCV virus (1*10(5) copies per milliliter) was detected within 40 min. Analysis of mapped nanopore reads alone, despite an average individual error rate of 24 % (range 8-49 %), permitted identification of the correct viral strain in all four isolates, and 90 % of the genome of CHIKV was recovered with 97-99 % accuracy. Using nanopore sequencing, metagenomic detection of viral pathogens directly from clinical samples was performed within an unprecedented <6 hr sample-to-answer turnaround time, and in a timeframe amenable to actionable clinical and public health diagnostics.

AB The residence time of a ligand-protein complex is a crucial aspect in determining biological effect in vivo. Despite its importance, the prediction of ligand koff still remains challenging for modern computational chemistry. We have developed aMetaD, a fast and generally applicable computational protocol to predict ligand-protein unbinding events using a molecular dynamics (MD) method based on adiabatic-bias MD and metadynamics. This physics-based, fully flexible, and pose-dependent ligand scoring function evaluates the maximum energy (RTscore) required to move the ligand from the bound-state energy basin to the next. Unbinding trajectories are automatically analyzed and translated into atomic solvation factor (SF) values representing the water dynamics during the unbinding event. This novel computational protocol was initially tested on two M3 muscarinic receptor and two adenosine A2A receptor antagonists and then evaluated on a test set of 12 CRF1R ligands. The resulting RTscores were used successfully to classify ligands with different residence times. Additionally, the SF analysis was used to detect key differences in the degree of accessibility to water molecules during the predicted ligand unbinding events. The protocol provides actionable working hypotheses that are applicable in a drug discovery program for the rational optimization of ligand binding kinetics.

AB Objective. To develop a methodology for assessing skill development in a course while providing objective evidence of success and actionable data to improve instructional effectiveness. Design. Course objectives were recast as skills to be demonstrated. Confidence in these skills was surveyed before and after the course. Student skills were demonstrated using 4 work products and a multiple-choice examination. Assessment. The change from precourse survey to postcourse survey was analyzed with a paired t test. Quality of the student work product was assessed using scoring guides. All students demonstrated skill mastery by scoring 70% or above on the work product, and 87/88 demonstrated individual progress on the surveyed skills during the 15-week course. Conclusion. This assessment strategy is based on sound design principles and provides robust multi-modal evidence of student achievement in skill development, which is not currently available using traditional student course evaluation surveys.

AB Drug resistance in Plasmodium parasites is a constant threat. Novel therapeutics, especially new drug combinations, must be identified at a faster rate. In response to the urgent need for new antimalarial drug combinations we screened a large collection of approved and investigational drugs, tested 13,910 drug pairs, and identified many promising antimalarial drug combinations. The activity of known antimalarial drug regimens was confirmed and a myriad of new classes of positively interacting drug pairings were discovered. Network and clustering analyses reinforced established mechanistic relationships for known drug combinations and identified several novel mechanistic hypotheses. From eleven screens comprising >4,600 combinations per parasite strain (including duplicates) we further investigated interactions between approved antimalarials, calcium homeostasis modulators, and inhibitors of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These studies highlight important targets and pathways and provide promising leads for clinically actionable antimalarial therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Efforts in global heath need to deal not only with current challenges, but also to anticipate new scenarios, which sometimes unfold at lightning speed. Predictive modeling is frequently used to assist planning, but outcomes depend heavily on a subset of critical assumptions, which are mostly hampered by our limited knowledge about the many factors, mechanisms and relationships that determine the dynamics of disease systems, by a lack of data to parameterize and validate models, and by uncertainties about future scenarios.; DISCUSSION: We propose a shift from a focus on the prediction of individual disease patterns to the identification and mitigation of broader fragilities in public health systems. Modeling capabilities should be used to perform "stress tests" on how interrelated fragilities respond when faced with a range of possible or plausible threats of different nature and intensity. This system should be able to reveal crosscutting solutions with the potential to address not only one threat, but multiple areas of vulnerability to future health risks. Actionable knowledge not based on a narrow subset of threats and conditions can better guide policy, build societal resilience and ensure effective prevention in an uncertain world.

AB BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of the oral tongue (OTSCC) is the most common malignancy of the oral cavity, characterized by frequent recurrence and poor survival. The last three decades has witnessed a change in the OTSCC epidemiological profile, with increasing incidence in younger patients, females and never-smokers. Here, we sought to characterize the OTSCC genomic landscape and to determine factors that may delineate the genetic basis of this disease, inform prognosis and identify targets for therapeutic intervention.; METHODS: Seventy-eight cases were subjected to whole-exome (n=18) and targeted deep sequencing (n=60).; RESULTS: While the most common mutation was in TP53, the OTSCC genetic landscape differed from previously described cohorts of patients with head and neck tumors: OTSCCs demonstrated frequent mutations in DST and RNF213, while alterations in CDKN2A and NOTCH1 were significantly less frequent. Despite a lack of previously reported NOTCH1 mutations, integrated analysis showed enrichments of alterations affecting Notch signaling in OTSCC. Importantly, these Notch pathway alterations were prognostic on multivariate analyses. A high proportion of OTSCCs also presented with alterations in drug targetable and chromatin remodeling genes. Patients harboring mutations in actionable pathways were more likely to succumb from recurrent disease compared with those who did not, suggesting that the former should be considered for treatment with targeted compounds in future trials.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study defines the Asian OTSCC mutational landscape, highlighting the key role of Notch signaling in oral tongue tumorigenesis. We also observed somatic mutations in multiple therapeutically relevant genes, which may represent candidate drug targets in this highly lethal tumor type.

AB Effective treatment options for advanced salivary gland tumors are lacking. To better understand these tumors, we report their genomic landscape. We studied the molecular aberrations in 117 patients with salivary gland tumors that were, on physician request, tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) using next-generation sequencing (182 or 236 genes), and analyzed by N-of-One, Inc. (Lexington, MA). There were 354 total aberrations, with 240 distinct aberrations identified in this patient population. Only 10 individuals (8.5%) had a molecular portfolio that was identical to any other patient (with four different portfolios amongst the ten patients). The most common abnormalities involved the TP53 gene (36/117 [30.8% of patients]), cyclin pathway (CCND1, CDK4/6 or CDKN2A/B) (31/117 [26.5%]) and PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN or AKT1/3) (28/117 [23.9%]). In multivariate analysis, statistically significant co-existing aberrations were observed as follows: TP53 and ERBB2 (p = 0.01), cyclin pathway and MDM2 (p = 0.03), and PI3K pathway and HRAS (p = 0.0001). We were able to identify possible cognate targeted therapies in most of the patients (107/117 [91.5%]), including FDA-approved drugs in 80/117 [68.4%]. In conclusion, salivary gland tumors were characterized by multiple distinct aberrations that mostly differed from patient to patient. Significant associations between aberrations in TP53 and ERBB2, the cyclin pathway and MDM2, and HRAS and the PI3K pathway were identified. Most patients had actionable alterations. These results provide a framework for tailored combinations of matched therapies.

AB Screening programs for asymptomatic newborns (newborn screening - NBS) have increasingly been implemented in many westernized countries since the end of the 20th century (Wilson et al., 2010). The major goal of these programs is to unselectively screen all newborns for a well defined group of severe, rare, clearly identifiable and actionable conditions. These conditions should be diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion to ensure short and long term health of the newborn as an infant and an adult. As such, NBS programs are one of the pivotal public health achievements of the past decade (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011) that have led to the saving of lives and improving quality of life as well as posing less financial burden on the health care system. Technically the currently practiced screening process is performed 48 hours after birth, using a minute amount of blood collected on a dried blood spot card, which is subsequently subjected to biochemical analysis predominantly using mass spectrometry assays.

AB Risk-based treatment approaches for neuroblastoma have been ongoing for decades. However, the criteria used to define risk in various institutional and cooperative groups were disparate, limiting the ability to compare clinical trial results. To mitigate this problem and enhance collaborative research, homogenous pretreatment patient cohorts have been defined by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group classification system. During the past 30 years, increasingly intensive, multimodality approaches have been developed to treat patients who are classified as high risk, whereas patients with low- or intermediate-risk neuroblastoma have received reduced therapy. This treatment approach has resulted in improved outcome, although survival for high-risk patients remains poor, emphasizing the need for more effective treatments. Increased knowledge regarding the biology and genetic basis of neuroblastoma has led to the discovery of druggable targets and promising, new therapeutic approaches. Collaborative efforts of institutions and international cooperative groups have led to advances in our understanding of neuroblastoma biology, refinements in risk classification, and stratified treatment strategies, resulting in improved outcome. International collaboration will be even more critical when evaluating therapies designed to treat small cohorts of patients with rare actionable mutations.  © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to assess the mutational status of multiple genes on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumors is rapidly being adopted in clinical settings, where quality control (QC) practices are required. Establishing reliable FFPE QC materials for NGS can be challenging and/or expensive. Here, we established a reliable and cost-effective FFPE QC material for routine utilization in the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHP2) assay.; METHODS: The performance characteristics of the CHP2 assay were determined by sequencing various cell line mixtures and 55 different FFPE tumors on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. A FFPE QC material was prepared from a mixture of cell lines derived from different cancers, comprising single nucleotide variants and small deletions on actionable genes at different allelic frequencies.; RESULTS: The CHP2 assay performed with high precision and sensitivity when custom variant calling pipeline parameters where established. In addition, all expected somatic variants in the QC material were consistently called at variant frequencies ranging from 9.1% (CV=11.1%) to 37.9% (CV=2.8%).; CONCLUSIONS: The availability of a reliable and cost-effective QC material is instrumental in assessing the performance of this or any targeted NGS assay that detects somatic variants in fixed solid tumor specimens.

AB PURPOSE: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement has been detected in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) using advanced molecular diagnostics tests including exon scanning, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next generation sequencing (NGS). We investigated if immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used to detect ALK rearrangement in gastrointestinal malignancies.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from consecutive gastric carcinoma (GC) and CRC patients who underwent surgical resection at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea were screened by IHC using ALK monoclonal antibody 5A4. IHC positive cases were confirmed by FISH, nCounter assays, and NGS-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). ALK IHC was further applied to CRC patients enrolled in a pathway-directed therapeutic trial.; RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-two GC and 172 CRC cases were screened by IHC. No GC sample was ALK IHC positive. One CRC (0.6%) was ALK IHC positive (3+) that was confirmed by ALK FISH and a novel CAD-ALK (C35; A20) fusion variant that resulted from a paracentric inversion event inv(2)(p22-21p23) was identified by CGP. One out of 50 CRC patients enrolled in a pathway-directed therapeutic trial was ALK IHC positive (3+) confirmed by ALK FISH and found to harbor the EML4-ALK (E21, A20) fusion variant by CGP. Growth of a tumor cell line derived from this EML4-ALK CRC patient was inhibited by ALK inhibitors crizotinib and entrectinib.; CONCLUSIONS: ALK IHC is a viable screening strategy for identifying ALK rearrangement in CRC. ALK rearrangement is a potential actionable driver mutation in CRC based on survival inhibition of patient tumor-derived cell line by potent ALK inhibitors.

AB Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has the added advantage of increasing breast conservation rates with equivalent survival outcomes compared with adjuvant chemotherapy. A subset of breast cancer patients who received NAC experienced early failure (EF) during the course of therapy or within a short period after curative breast surgery. In contrast, patients with pathological complete response (pCR) were reported to have markedly favorable outcomes. This study was performed to identify actionable mutation(s) and to explain refractoriness and responsiveness to NAC. Included in this analysis were 76 patients among 397 with locally advanced breast cancer for whom a preoperative fresh-frozen paraffin-embedded tumor block was available for next-generation sequencing using AmpliSeq. The incidence of missense mutations in KRAS was much higher in patients with EF than in other groups (p < 0.01).

AB INTRODUCTION: Targeting HER2 has improved outcomes in metastatic GE (mGE) cancer. In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of molecular profiling in patients with refractory mGE cancer in routine clinical practice.; METHODS: Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples for patients with mGE were analyzed with commercially available targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and/or FISH for MET amplification. We also reviewed the patients' medical records for concurrent HER 2 testing.; RESULTS: Tumor samples from 99 patients with mGE cancer were analyzed as follows: NGS (N = 56), FISH for MET amplification (N = 65), IHC and/or FISH for HER2 (N = 87). Of patients who underwent NGS, 50/56 (89%) had at least one actionable molecular alteration. The most notable actionable alterations included cell cycle abnormalities (58%), HER2 amplification (30%), PI3KCA mutation (14%), MCL1 amplification (11%), PTEN loss (9%), CDH1 mutation (2%) and MET amplification (5%). Ninety-two percent (12/13) of patients with HER2 amplification by NGS were positive for HER2 by IHC and/or FISH. In contrast, only 12/18 (66%) patients positive for HER2 by IHC and/or FISH demonstrated HER2 amplification by NGS.; CONCLUSION: Comprehensive molecular testing is feasible in clinical practice and provides a platform for screening patients for molecularly guided clinical trials and available targeted therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: Scoliosis is a feature of several genetic disorders that are also associated with aortic aneurysm, including Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and type-IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Life-threatening complications of aortic aneurysm can be decreased through early diagnosis. Genetic screening for mutations in populations at risk, such as patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, may improve recognition of these disorders.; METHODS: The coding regions of five clinically actionable genes associated with scoliosis (COL3A1, FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and SMAD3) and aortic aneurysm were sequenced in 343 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cases. Gene variants that had minor allele frequencies of <0.0001 or were present in human disease mutation databases were identified. Variants were classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of unknown significance.; RESULTS: Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in 0.9% (three) of 343 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cases. Two patients had pathogenic SMAD3 nonsense mutations consistent with type-III Loeys-Dietz syndrome and one patient had a pathogenic FBN1 mutation with subsequent confirmation of Marfan syndrome. Variants of unknown significance in COL3A1 and FBN1 were identified in 5.0% (seventeen) of 343 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cases. Six FBN1 variants were previously reported in patients with Marfan syndrome, yet were considered variants of unknown significance based on the level of evidence. Variants of unknown significance occurred most frequently in FBN1 and were associated with greater curve severity, systemic features of Marfan syndrome, and joint hypermobility.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinically actionable pathogenic mutations in genes associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and aortic aneurysm are rare in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who are not suspected of having these disorders, although variants of unknown significance are relatively common.; CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Routine genetic screening of all patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis for mutations in clinically actionable aortic aneurysm disease genes is not recommended on the basis of the high frequency of variants of unknown significance. Clinical evaluation and family history should heighten indications for genetic referral and testing. Copyright © 2015 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.

AB A Provider Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) document transforms medical wishes for end-of-life care into actionable medical orders. This study was conducted to assess the extent of POLST implementation amongst nursing facilities in Hawai'i. We performed a telephone survey . The survey instrument included questions about advance care planning processes, POLST training procedures, and implementation of the POLST paradigm. Data were collected in July 2014, the month POLST signatory capacity expanded to include Advance Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs). Of the 39 nursing facilities contacted, 23 (59%) responded. All but one facility had a POLST program in place. Social workers and nursing staff usually held the POLST discussions. Of the 23 responding facilities, 13 (57%) had at least one APRN provider, and 8 had APRNs involved in POLST discussions. In all but one instance, APRNs were also already signing the document. The percentage of residents with completed POLST forms per facility was reported to be over 50% for 20 out of 23 (87%) of responding nursing facilities with 10 (43%) reporting achieving 100% implementation rates. Training seminars and online educational materials were the main methods for training staff, with social workers and nurses being the focus for training. The results of this study demonstrate significant penetration of the Hawai'i POLST program into the nursing home community. Most nursing facilities required staff to undergo POLST training. Some facilities reported APRNs were already involved in signing the POLST form, only weeks after their signatory capacity was enacted.

AB Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among men in the United States and more than half of patients experience recurrences within 5 years after initial diagnosis. Additional clinically informative and actionable biomarkers of the recurrent bladder cancer phenotypes are needed to improve screening and molecular therapeutic approaches for recurrence prevention. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) is a short noncoding regulatory RNA with tumor suppressive attributes. We leveraged our unique, large, population-based prognostic study of bladder cancer in New Hampshire, United States to evaluate miR-34a expression levels in individual tumor cells to assess prognostic value. We collected detailed exposure and medical history data, as well as tumor tissue specimens from bladder patients and followed them long-term for recurrence, progression and survival. Fluorescence-based in situ hybridization assays were performed on urothelial carcinoma tissue specimens (n=229). A larger proportion of the nonmuscle invasive tumors had high levels of miR-34a within the carcinoma cells compared to those tumors that were muscle invasive. Patients with high miR-34a levels in their baseline nonmuscle invasive tumors experienced lower risks of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.93). Consistent with these observations, we demonstrated a functional tumor suppressive role for miR-34a in cultured urothelial cells, including reduced matrigel invasion and growth in soft agar. Our results highlight the need for further clinical studies of miR-34a as a guide for recurrence screening and as a possible candidate therapeutic target in the bladder. © 2014 UICC.

AB Patients, providers and policy-makers rely heavily on comparative effectiveness research (CER) when making complex, real-world medical decisions. In particular, Medicaid providers and policy-makers face unique challenges in decision-making because their program cares for traditionally underserved populations, especially children, pregnant women and people with mental illness. Because these patient populations have generally been underrepresented in research discussions, CER questions for these groups may be understudied. To address this problem, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality commissioned our team to work with Medicaid Medical Directors and other stakeholders to identify relevant CER questions. Through an iterative process of topic identification and refinement, we developed relevant, feasible and actionable questions based on issues affecting Medicaid programs nationwide. We describe challenges and limitations and provide recommendations for future stakeholder engagement.

AB The availability of data on digital traces is growing to unprecedented sizes, but inferring actionable knowledge from large-scale data is far from being trivial. This is especially important for computational finance, where digital traces of human behaviour offer a great potential to drive trading strategies. We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment.

AB Whole-exome sequencing (WES) arises as a new approach in diagnosing individuals affected by multigenic and complex phenotypes. Herein, we aim to examine whether WES is useful in screening asymptomatic individuals for actionable interventions, which has not yet been established. Twenty-five healthy adults underwent WES, bioinformatics, and manual curation of their exomes. Six participants (24%) harbored significant, management-changing variants in cancer predisposition genes, American College of Medical Genetics, and genomics reportable cardiac diseases and pharmacogenomic biomarkers that have led to clinical recommendations and interventions. Furthermore, more than 80% of the participants (21) carried 1-3 genetic variants with an associated clinical guideline for an altered drug dosing or administration based on the FDA's table of pharmacogenomics. These results support WES potential not only to answer specific diagnostic questions presented by the relevant personal and/or family history but also to uncover clinically important genetic findings unrelated to the primary indication for sequencing.

AB Non-small cell lung carcinoma is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Understanding the molecular biology of survival and proliferation of cancer cells led to a new molecular classification of lung cancer and the development of targeted therapies with promising results. With the advances of image-guided biopsy techniques, tumor samples are becoming smaller, and the molecular testing techniques have to overcome the challenge of integrating the characterization of a panel of abnormalities including gene mutations, copy-number changes, and fusions in a reduced number of assays using only a small amount of genetic material. This article reviews the current knowledge about the most frequent actionable molecular abnormalities in non-small cell lung carcinoma, the new approaches of molecular analysis, and the implications of these findings in the context of clinical practice.

AB Genotype-directed targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but they have not yet been comprehensively studied in the adjuvant setting. Previous trials of adjuvant targeted therapy in unselected early stage NSCLC patients showed no benefit versus placebo, however retrospective data suggests improved disease free survival (DFS) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in patients with appropriate molecular alterations. A definitive prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of targeted therapies for NSCLC is needed to determine the efficacy of targeted therapy following surgical resection and standard adjuvant therapy. The principal challenges facing such a trial are (I) identification of actionable alterations in early stage patients; and (II) realization of sufficient enrollment to power definitive analyses. The ALCHEMIST trial (Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trial) was designed to overcome these challenges. Using the national clinical trials network (NCTN) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), several thousand patients with operable NSCLC will undergo tumor genotyping for EGFR mutations or rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Following resection and completion of standard adjuvant therapy, patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC will be randomized to erlotinib versus placebo (1:1), those with ALK-rearranged NSCLC will be randomized to crizotinib versus placebo (1:1), while those not enrolled onto the adjuvant trials will continue to be followed on the screening trial. ALCHEMIST also provides for the collection of tissue at baseline and at recurrence (if available) to characterize mechanisms of recurrence and of resistance to targeted therapy. Thus, ALCHEMIST is a platform for validation of targeted therapy as part of curative care in NSCLC and creates an opportunity to advance our understanding of disease biology.

AB Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are essential to develop advances in heart failure (HF). The need for increasing numbers of patients (without substantial cost increase) and generalization of results led to the disappearance of international boundaries in large RCTs. The significant geographic differences in patients' characteristics, outcomes, and, most importantly, treatment effect observed in HF trials have recently been highlighted. Whether the observed regional discrepancies in HF trials are due to trial-specific issues, patient heterogeneity, structural differences in countries, or a complex interaction between factors are the questions we propose to debate in this review. To do so, we will analyse and review data from HF trials conducted in different world regions, from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and acute heart failure (AHF). Finally, we will suggest objective and actionable measures in order to mitigate regional discrepancies in future trials, particularly in HF-PEF where prognostic modifying treatments are urgently needed and in which trials are more prone to selection bias, due to a larger patient heterogeneity.  © 2015 The Authors European Journal of Heart Failure © 2015 European Society of Cardiology.

AB UNLABELLED: There are more than 1 million patient falls each year in the United States. Falls are known to be a sign of poor health, are a marker of decline in function, and are associated with high morbidity. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a Falls Roundtable intervention for reducing the rates of patient falls in an urban academic trauma center emergency department.; METHODS: We implemented a Falls Roundtable performance-improvement debriefing intervention in a single urban academic emergency department. To evaluate this intervention, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patient fall events 13 months before and 14 months after implementation. We evaluated pre- and post-intervention differences in the total number of assisted falls, unassisted falls, and rate of falls.; RESULTS: Despite a slowly improving trend in falls after the intervention, there was no statistically significant improvement in the number of assisted falls, number of unassisted falls, or rate of falls. The Falls Roundtable intervention was helpful in identifying many additional actionable improvement opportunities in the emergency department.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The Falls Roundtable incident debriefing intervention alone does not appear to be an effective tool for falls prevention in the ED setting but may serve as an integral component of a multifaceted fall-reduction strategy.

AB When sequencing blood and tumor samples to identify targetable somatic variants for cancer therapy, clinically relevant germline variants may be uncovered. We evaluated the prevalence of deleterious germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes in women with breast cancer referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and returned clinically actionable results to patients. Exome sequencing was performed on blood samples from women with invasive breast cancer referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Germline variants within 142 hereditary cancer susceptibility genes were filtered and reviewed for pathogenicity. Return of results was offered to patients with deleterious variants in actionable genes if they were not aware of their result through clinical testing. 124 patients were enrolled (median age 51) with the following subtypes: triple negative (n = 43, 34.7%), HER2+ (n = 37, 29.8%), luminal B (n = 31, 25%), and luminal A (n = 13, 10.5%). Twenty-eight deleterious variants were identified in 26/124 (21.0%) patients in the following genes: ATM (n = 3), BLM (n = 1), BRCA1 (n = 4), BRCA2 (n = 8), CHEK2 (n = 2), FANCA (n = 1), FANCI (n = 1), FANCL (n = 1), FANCM (n = 1), FH (n = 1), MLH3 (n = 1), MUTYH (n = 2), PALB2 (n = 1), and WRN (n = 1). 121/124 (97.6%) patients consented to return of research results. Thirteen (10.5%) had actionable variants, including four that were returned to patients and led to changes in medical management. Deleterious variants in cancer susceptibility genes are highly prevalent in patients with invasive breast cancer referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergoing exome sequencing. Detection of these variants impacts medical management.

AB RNA-seq by poly(A) selection is currently the most common protocol for whole transcriptome sequencing as it provides a broad, detailed, and accurate view of the RNA landscape. Unfortunately, the utility of poly(A) libraries is greatly limited when the input RNA is degraded, which is the norm for research tissues and clinical samples, especially when specimens are formalin-fixed. To facilitate the use of RNA sequencing beyond cell lines and in the clinical setting, we developed an exome-capture transcriptome protocol with greatly improved performance on degraded RNA. Capture transcriptome libraries enable measuring absolute and differential gene expression, calling genetic variants, and detecting gene fusions. Through validation against gold-standard poly(A) and Ribo-Zero libraries from intact RNA, we show that capture RNA-seq provides accurate and unbiased estimates of RNA abundance, uniform transcript coverage, and broad dynamic range. Unlike poly(A) selection and Ribo-Zero depletion, capture libraries retain these qualities regardless of RNA quality and provide excellent data from clinical specimens including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. Systematic improvements across key applications of RNA-seq are shown on a cohort of prostate cancer patients and a set of clinical FFPE samples. Further, we demonstrate the utility of capture RNA-seq libraries in a patient with a highly malignant solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) enrolled in our clinical sequencing program called MI-ONCOSEQ. Capture transcriptome profiling from FFPE revealed two oncogenic fusions: the pathognomonic NAB2-STAT6 inversion and a therapeutically actionable BRAF fusion, which may drive this specific cancer's aggressive phenotype.  © 2015 Cieslik et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB IMPORTANCE: Cancer is caused by a diverse array of somatic and germline genomic aberrations. Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have improved the ability to detect these molecular aberrations with greater sensitivity. However, integrating them into clinical management in an individualized manner has proven challenging.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of integrative clinical sequencing and genetic counseling in the assessment and treatment of children and young adults with cancer.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-site, observational, consecutive case series (May 2012-October 2014) involving 102 children and young adults (mean age, 10.6 years; median age, 11.5 years, range, 0-22 years) with relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer.; EXPOSURES: Participants underwent integrative clinical exome (tumor and germline DNA) and transcriptome (tumor RNA) sequencing and genetic counseling. Results were discussed by a precision medicine tumor board, which made recommendations to families and their physicians.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of patients with potentially actionable findings, results of clinical actions based on integrative clinical sequencing, and estimated proportion of patients or their families at risk of future cancer.; RESULTS: Of the 104 screened patients, 102 enrolled with 91 (89%) having adequate tumor tissue to complete sequencing. Only the 91 patients were included in all calculations, including 28 (31%) with hematological malignancies and 63 (69%) with solid tumors. Forty-two patients (46%) had actionable findings that changed their cancer management: 15 of 28 (54%) with hematological malignancies and 27 of 63 (43%) with solid tumors. Individualized actions were taken in 23 of the 91 (25%) based on actionable integrative clinical sequencing findings, including change in treatment for 14 patients (15%) and genetic counseling for future risk for 9 patients (10%). Nine of 91 (10%) of the personalized clinical interventions resulted in ongoing partial clinical remission of 8 to 16 months or helped sustain complete clinical remission of 6 to 21 months. All 9 patients and families with actionable incidental genetic findings agreed to genetic counseling and screening.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series involving young patients with relapsed or refractory cancer, incorporation of integrative clinical sequencing data into clinical management was feasible, revealed potentially actionable findings in 46% of patients, and was associated with change in treatment and family genetic counseling for a small proportion of patients. The lack of a control group limited assessing whether better clinical outcomes resulted from this approach than outcomes that would have occurred with standard care.

AB The information-theoretic concept of Shannon entropy can be used to quantify the information provided by a diagnostic test. We hypothesized that in tumor types with stereotyped mutational profiles, the results of NGS testing would yield lower average information than in tumors with more diverse mutations. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the entropy of NGS testing in various cancer types, using results obtained from clinical sequencing. A set of 238 tumors were subjected to clinical targeted NGS across all exons of 27 genes. There were 120 actionable variants in 109 cases, occurring in the genes KRAS, EGFR, PTEN, PIK3CA, KIT, BRAF, NRAS, IDH1, and JAK2. Sequencing results for each tumor were modeled as a dichotomized genotype (actionable mutation detected or not detected) for each of the 27 genes. Based upon the entropy of these genotypes, sequencing was most informative for colorectal cancer (3.235 bits of information/case) followed by high grade glioma (2.938 bits), lung cancer (2.197 bits), pancreatic cancer (1.339 bits), and sarcoma/STTs (1.289 bits). In the most informative cancer types, the information content of NGS was similar to surgical pathology examination (modeled at approximately 2-3 bits). Entropy provides a novel measure of utility for laboratory testing in general and for NGS in particular. This metric is, however, purely analytical and does not capture the relative clinical significance of the identified variants, which may also differ across tumor types.

AB PURPOSE: We report the experience with 2,000 consecutive patients with advanced cancer who underwent testing on a genomic testing protocol, including the frequency of actionable alterations across tumor types, subsequent enrollment onto clinical trials, and the challenges for trial enrollment.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standardized hotspot mutation analysis was performed in 2,000 patients, using either an 11-gene (251 patients) or a 46- or 50-gene (1,749 patients) multiplex platform. Thirty-five genes were considered potentially actionable based on their potential to be targeted with approved or investigational therapies.; RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-nine patients (39%) had at least one mutation in potentially actionable genes. Eighty-three patients (11%) with potentially actionable mutations went on genotype-matched trials targeting these alterations. Of 230 patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN/BRAF mutations that returned for therapy, 116 (50%) received a genotype-matched drug. Forty patients (17%) were treated on a genotype-selected trial requiring a mutation for eligibility, 16 (7%) were treated on a genotype-relevant trial targeting a genomic alteration without biomarker selection, and 40 (17%) received a genotype-relevant drug off trial. Challenges to trial accrual included patient preference of noninvestigational treatment or local treatment, poor performance status or other reasons for trial ineligibility, lack of trials/slots, and insurance denial.; CONCLUSION: Broad implementation of multiplex hotspot testing is feasible; however, only a small portion of patients with actionable alterations were actually enrolled onto genotype-matched trials. Increased awareness of therapeutic implications and access to novel therapeutics are needed to optimally leverage results from broad-based genomic testing. © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB PURPOSE: To compare the closure of ≤ 8-F versus 9-F to 12-F femoral access using the 8-F Angio-Seal VIP device (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, Minnesota).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis, a consecutive series of 137 patients (n = 92 male patients [67.2%]; overall mean age, 71.0 y ± 9.8) was evaluated. Common femoral artery access was performed in all patients, and either unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin was used for anticoagulation. Access site complications were defined as follows: type 0, no bleeding; type 1, no actionable bleeding; type 2, actionable bleeding.; RESULTS: The 8-F Angio-Seal VIP device was used for closure of ≤ 8-F femoral access in 76 patients (55.5%) and for 9-F to 12-F femoral access in 61 patients (44.5%). Access site complications were observed after 8-F Angio-Seal deployment in 11 patients (8.0%) (≤ 8 F, n = 5 [6.6%]; 9-12 F, n = 6 [9.8%]; P = .54). Comparing ≤ 8-F with 9-F to 12-F femoral access, type 1 complications were observed in 3 and 6 patients (P = .19) and type 2 complications were observed in 2 and 0 patients (P = .50), respectively. All type 1 complications were managed by applying external compression. Type 2 complications (n = 2 pseudoaneurysms) were treated with thrombin injection in 1 patient and secondary percutaneous intervention in 1 patient.; CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 8-F Angio-Seal for the closure of > 8-F femoral access is safe and effective. Complication rates when using the 8-F Angio-Seal for closure of ≤ 8-F and 9-F to 12-F femoral access are comparable. Copyright © 2015 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The incidence of biliary tract cancer (BTC), including intrahepatic (ICC) and extrahepatic (ECC) cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, has increased globally; however, no effective targeted molecular therapies have been approved at the present time. Here we molecularly characterized 260 BTCs and uncovered spectra of genomic alterations that included new potential therapeutic targets. Gradient spectra of mutational signatures with a higher burden of the APOBEC-associated mutation signature were observed in gallbladder cancer and ECC. Thirty-two significantly altered genes, including ELF3, were identified, and nearly 40% of cases harbored targetable genetic alterations. Gene fusions involving FGFR2 and PRKACA or PRKACB preferentially occurred in ICC and ECC, respectively, and the subtype-associated prevalence of actionable growth factor-mediated signals was noteworthy. The subgroup with the poorest prognosis had significant enrichment of hypermutated tumors and a characteristic elevation in the expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Accordingly, immune-modulating therapies might also be potentially promising options for these patients.

AB Most clinically actionable alterations in lung adenocarcinomas are detected using molecular or cytogenetic techniques. However, many such alterations have a protein-level correlate that can be interrogated using immunohistochemistry. This review will summarize the therapeutic relevance of predictive biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma including the oncogenes EGFR, MET, ALK, RET, and ROS1 and tumor suppressors PTEN and LKB1 with an emphasis on established and emerging protein immunohistochemistry reagents and their promise in clinical practice.

AB Gene panels for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment are gaining acceptance, even though the clinical utility of these panels is not yet fully defined. Technical questions remain, however, about the performance and clinical interpretation of gene panels in comparison with traditional tests. We tested 1105 individuals using a 29-gene next-generation sequencing panel and observed 100% analytical concordance with traditional and reference data on >750 comparable variants. These 750 variants included technically challenging classes of sequence and copy number variation that together represent a significant fraction (13.4%) of the pathogenic variants observed. For BRCA1 and BRCA2, we also compared variant interpretations in traditional reports to those produced using only non-proprietary resources and following criteria based on recent (2015) guidelines. We observed 99.8% net report concordance, albeit with a slightly higher variant of uncertain significance rate. In 4.5% of BRCA-negative cases, we uncovered pathogenic variants in other genes, which appear clinically relevant. Previously unseen variants requiring interpretation accumulated rapidly, even after 1000 individuals had been tested. We conclude that next-generation sequencing panel testing can provide results highly comparable to traditional testing and can uncover potentially actionable findings that may be otherwise missed. Challenges remain for the broad adoption of panel tests, some of which will be addressed by the accumulation of large public databases of annotated clinical variants.

AB Massively parallel sequencing technologies have enabled characterization of genomic alterations across multiple tumor types. Efforts have focused on identifying driver mutations because they represent potential targets for therapy. However, because of the presence of driver and passenger mutations, it is often challenging to assign the clinical relevance of specific mutations observed in patients. Currently, there are multiple databases and tools that provide in silico assessment for potential drivers; however, there is no comprehensive resource for mutations with functional characterization. Therefore, we created an expert-curated database of potentially actionable driver mutations for molecular pathologists to facilitate annotation of cancer genomic testing. We reviewed scientific literature to identify variants that have been functionally characterized invitro or invivo as driver mutations. We obtained the chromosome location and all possible nucleotide positions for each amino acid change and uploaded them to the Cancer Driver Log (CanDL) database with associated literature reference indicating functional driver evidence. In addition to a simple interface, the database allows users to download all or selected genes as a comma-separated values file for incorporation into their own analysis pipeline. Furthermore, the database includes a mechanism for third-party contributions to support updates for novel driver mutations. Overall, this freely available database will facilitate rapid annotation of cancer genomic testing in molecular pathology laboratories for mutations.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical implementation of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is challenged by poor control for stochastic sampling, library preparation biases and qualitative sequencing error. To address these challenges we developed and tested two hypotheses.; METHODS: Hypothesis 1: Analytical variation in quantification is predicted by stochastic sampling effects at input of a) amplifiable nucleic acid target molecules into the library preparation, b) amplicons from library into sequencer, or c) both. We derived equations using Monte Carlo simulation to predict assay coefficient of variation (CV) based on these three working models and tested them against NGS data from specimens with well characterized molecule inputs and sequence counts prepared using competitive multiplex-PCR amplicon-based NGS library preparation method comprising synthetic internal standards (IS). Hypothesis 2: Frequencies of technically-derived qualitative sequencing errors (i.e., base substitution, insertion and deletion) observed at each base position in each target native template (NT) are concordant with those observed in respective competitive synthetic IS present in the same reaction. We measured error frequencies at each base position within amplicons from each of 30 target NT, then tested whether they correspond to those within the 30 respective IS.; RESULTS: For hypothesis 1, the Monte Carlo model derived from both sampling events best predicted CV and explained 74% of observed assay variance. For hypothesis 2, observed frequency and type of sequence variation at each base position within each IS was concordant with that observed in respective NTs (R2 = 0.93).; CONCLUSION: In targeted NGS, synthetic competitive IS control for stochastic sampling at input of both target into library preparation and of target library product into sequencer, and control for qualitative errors generated during library preparation and sequencing. These controls enable accurate clinical diagnostic reporting of confidence limits and limit of detection for copy number measurement, and of frequency for each actionable mutation.

AB Hospitals have invested and continue to invest heavily in building information systems to support operations at various levels of administration. These systems generate a lot of data but fail to effectively convert these data into actionable information for decision makers. Such ineffectiveness often is attributed to a lack of alignment between strategic planning and information technology (IT) initiatives supporting operational goals. We present a case study that illustrates how the use of digital dashboards at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland (SJMO) Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan, was instrumental in supporting such an alignment. Driven by a focus on key performance indicators (KPIs), dashboard applications also led to other tangible and intangible benefits. An ability to track KPIs over time and against established targets, with drill-down capabilities, allowed leadership to hold staff members accountable for achieving their performance targets. By displaying the dashboards in prominent locations (such as operational unit floors, the physicians' cafeteria, and nursing stations), SJMO ushered in transparency in the planning and monitoring processes. The need to develop KPI metrics and drive data collection efforts became ingrained in the work ethos of people at every level of the organization. Although IT-enabled dashboards have been instrumental in supporting this cultural transformation, the focus of investment was the ability of technology to make collective vision and action the responsibility of all stakeholders.

AB The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is charged with providing high-quality health care, not only in terms of technical competence but also with regard to patient-centered care experiences. Patient-centered coordination of care and communication are especially important in cancer care, as deficiencies in these areas have been implicated in many cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, because cancer care facilities are concentrated within the VHA system, geographical and system-level barriers may present prominent obstacles to quality care. Systematic assessment of patient-centered communication (PCC) may help identify both individual veterans who are at risk of suboptimal care and opportunities for quality improvement initiatives at the service, facility, or system-wide level. In this manuscript, we describe our vision to implement an assessment of PCC through patient self-report to improve the quality of cancer care and other health services in the VHA. We outline a possible strategy to assess PCC that leverages the VHA's existing initiative to promote use of an online personal health record for veterans (MyHealtheVet). Questionnaires administered periodically or following specific episodes of care can be targeted to assess PCC in cancer care. Assessment of PCC can also be tied to clinical and administrative data for more robust analysis of patient outcomes. Ultimately, the goal of any assessment of PCC is to gather valid, actionable data that can assist VHA clinicians and staff with providing the best possible care for veterans with cancer.

AB Precision medicine requires appropriate application of genomics in clinical practice. In cancer, we have witnessed practice-changing examples of how genomic knowledge is translated into more tailored and effective therapies. The next opportunity is to embed cancer genomics in clinical context so that patient-centric longitudinal clinical, genomic, and molecular phenotypes can be compiled for adaptive learning between precision medicine research and clinical care with the goal of accelerating clinically-actionable discoveries. We describe here an adaptive learning platform, APOLLO (adaptive patient-oriented longitudinal learning and optimization) designed to integrate genomic research in the context of, but not in the path of, routine and investigational clinical care for purposes of enabling data-driven discovery across disciplines such that every patient can contribute to and potentially benefit from research discoveries.

AB BACKGROUND: A recent mixed-methods study on the state of emergency medical services (EMS) research in Canada led to the generation of nineteen actionable recommendations. As part of the dissemination plan, a survey was distributed to EMS stakeholders to determine the anticipated impact and feasibility of implementing these recommendations in Canadian systems.; METHODS: An online survey explored both the implementation impact and feasibility for each recommendation using a five-point scale. The sample consisted of participants from the Canadian National EMS Research Agenda study (published in 2013) and additional EMS research stakeholders identified through snowball sampling. Responses were analysed descriptively using median and plotted on a matrix. Participants reported any planned or ongoing initiatives related to the recommendations, and required or anticipated resources. Free text responses were analysed with simple content analysis, collated by recommendation.; RESULTS: The survey was sent to 131 people, 94 (71.8%) of whom responded: 30 EMS managers/regulators (31.9%), 22 researchers (23.4%), 15 physicians (16.0%), 13 educators (13.8%), and 5 EMS providers (5.3%). Two recommendations (11%) had a median impact score of 4 (of 5) and feasibility score of 4 (of 5). Eight recommendations (42%) had an impact score of 5, with a feasibility score of 3. Nine recommendations (47%) had an impact score of 4 and a feasibility score of 3.; CONCLUSIONS: For most recommendations, participants scored the anticipated impact higher than the feasibility to implement. Ongoing or planned initiatives exist pertaining to all recommendations except one. All of the recommendations will require additional resources to implement.

AB The ability to reliably distinguish synchronous primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from intrapulmonary metastatic spread affects staging and treatment decisions in resected NSCLC. Adjuvant therapy for early-stage NSCLC is complicated and recommendations are primarily based on older data from trials that used now-outdated staging systems. Patients found to have 2 tumors with similar morphology in the same lobe are currently staged as pathologic T3 (pT3) but such cases represent a minority of patients in adjuvant lung cancer trials. Potentially more precise than tumor morphology alone, comprehensive genomic profiling technologies have the power to discriminate whether tumors in the same lobe represent 2 separate primary lesions or localized spread of a single lesion. In addition to lineage insights, tumor profiling simultaneously provides information on actionable genomic alterations. In this review we discuss the data that support the ability of molecular technologies to distinguish synchronous primary tumors from intrapulmonary metastases and discuss the use of molecular assays as an adjunct to current staging systems. Two cases are presented to highlight the potential immediate clinical implications of comprehensive genomic profiling.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVES: Measures for assessing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that may have initially been developed for research are increasingly being recommended for use in clinical practice as well. Although psychometric rigor is essential, this article focuses on pragmatic characteristics of PROs that may enhance uptake into clinical practice.; STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Three sources were drawn on in identifying pragmatic criteria for PROs: (1) selected literature review including recommendations by other expert groups; (2) key features of several model public domain PROs; and (3) the authors' experience in developing practical PROs.; RESULTS: Eight characteristics of a practical PRO include: (1) actionability (i.e., scores guide diagnostic or therapeutic actions/decision making); (2) appropriateness for the relevant clinical setting; (3) universality (i.e., for screening, severity assessment, and monitoring across multiple conditions); (4) self-administration; (5) item features (number of items and bundling issues); (6) response options (option number and dimensions, uniform vs. varying options, time frame, intervals between options); (7) scoring (simplicity and interpretability); and (8) accessibility (nonproprietary, downloadable, available in different languages and for vulnerable groups, and incorporated into electronic health records).; CONCLUSION: Balancing psychometric and pragmatic factors in the development of PROs is important for accelerating the incorporation of PROs into clinical practice.

AB INTRODUCTION: Oncogenic driver mutations activating receptor tyrosine kinase pathways are promising predictive markers for targeted treatment. We investigated the mutation profile of an updated driver events list on receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS/PI3K axis and the clinicopathologic implications in a cohort of never-smoker predominated Chinese lung adenocarcinoma.; METHODS: We tested 154 lung adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas for EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET, NRAS, MAP2K1, and RIT1 mutations by polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing. MET amplification and ALK and ROS1 translocations were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridizations. MET and thyroid transcription factor-1 protein expressions were investigated by immunohistochemistry.; RESULTS: Seventy percent of lung adenocarcinomas carried actionable driver events. Alterations on EGFR (43%), KRAS (11.4%), ALK (6%), and MET (5.4%) were frequently found. ROS1 translocation and mutations involving BRAF, HER2, NRAS, and PIK3CA were also detected. No mutation was observed in RIT1 and MAP2K1. Patients with EGFR mutations had a favorable prognosis, whereas those with MET mutations had poorer overall survival. Multivariate analysis further demonstrated that MET mutation was an independent prognostic factor. Although MET protein expression was detected in 65% of lung adenocarcinoma, only 10% of the MET-immunohistochemistry positive tumors harbor MET DNA alterations that drove protein overexpression. Appropriate predictive biomarker is essential for selecting patients who might benefit from specific targeted therapy.; CONCLUSION: Actionable driver events can be detected in two thirds of lung adenocarcinoma. MET DNA alterations define a subset of patients with aggressive diseases that might potentially benefit from anti-MET targeted therapy. High negative predictive values of thyroid transcription factor-1 and MET expression suggest potential roles as surrogate markers for EGFR and/or MET mutations.

AB Genetic testing based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) often returns results that are not directly clinically actionable as well as raising the possibility of incidental (secondary) findings. In this article, we first survey the laws and policies guiding both researchers and clinicians in the return of results for WGS-based genetic testing. We then provide an overview of the landscape of international legislation and policies for return of these results, including considerations for return of incidental findings. Finally, we consider a range of approaches for the return of results.

AB AIMS: This paper on pelvic-floor-muscle training (PFMT) adherence, the second of four from the International Continence Society's 2011 State-of-the-Science Conference, aims to (1) identify and collate current adherence outcome measures, (2) report the determinants of adherence, (3) report on PFMT adherence strategies, and (4) make actionable clinical and research recommendations.; METHOD: Data were amassed from a literature review and an expert panel (2011 conference), following consensus statement methodology. Experts in pelvic floor dysfunction collated and synthesized the evidence and expert opinions on PFMT adherence for urinary incontinence (UI) and lower bowel dysfunction in men and women and pelvic organ prolapse in women.; RESULTS: The literature was scarce for most of the studied populations except for limited research on women with UI.; OUTCOME MEASURES: Exercise diaries were the most widely-used adherence outcome measure, PFMT adherence was inconsistently monitored and inadequately reported. Determinants: Research, mostly secondary analyses of RCTs, suggested that intention to adhere, self-efficacy expectations, attitudes towards the exercises, perceived benefits and a high social pressure to engage in PFMT impacted adherence.; STRATEGIES: Few trials studied and compared adherence strategies. A structured PFMT programme, an enthusiastic physiotherapist, audio prompts, use of established theories of behavior change, and user-consultations seem to increase adherence.; CONCLUSION: The literature on adherence outcome measures, determinants and strategies remains scarce for the studied populations with PFM dysfunction, except in women with UI. Although some current adherence findings can be applied to clinical practice, more effective and standardized research is urgently needed across all the sub-populations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Today's public health crises, as exemplified by the Ebola outbreak, lead to dramatic calls to action that typically include improved electronic monitoring systems to better prepare for, and respond to, similar occurrences in the future. Even a preliminary public health informatics evaluation of the current Ebola crisis exposes the need for enhanced coordination and sharing of trustworthy public health intelligence. We call for a consumer-centric model of public health intelligence and the formation of a national center to guide public health intelligence gathering and synthesis. Sharing accurate and actionable information with government agencies, health care practitioners, policymakers, and, critically, the general public, will mark a shift from doing public health surveillance on people to doing public health surveillance for people.

AB During dengue outbreaks, acute diagnosis at the patient's point of need followed by appropriate supportive therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. To facilitate needed diagnosis, we developed and optimized a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay that detects all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). We used a quencher to reduce nonspecific amplification. The assay does not require expensive thermocyclers, utilizing a simple water bath to maintain the reaction at 63 °C. Results can be visualized using UV fluorescence, handheld readers, or lateral flow immunochromatographic tests. We report a sensitivity of 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.7-94.8%) and specificity of 93.0% (95% CI, 83.0-98.1%) using a panel of clinical specimens characterized by DENV quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This pan-serotype DENV RT-LAMP can be adapted to field-expedient formats where it can provide actionable diagnosis near the patient's point of need. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Clinical exome sequencing (CES) has become an increasingly popular diagnostic tool in patients with heterogeneous genetic disorders, especially in those with neurocognitive phenotypes. Utility of CES in consanguineous populations has not yet been determined on a large scale. A clinical cohort of 149 probands from Qatar with suspected Mendelian, mainly neurocognitive phenotypes, underwent CES from July 2012 to June 2014. Intellectual disability and global developmental delay were the most common clinical presentations but our cohort displayed other phenotypes, such as epilepsy, dysmorphism, microcephaly and other structural brain anomalies and autism. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation, including pathogenic CNVs, was identified in 89 probands for a diagnostic yield of 60%. Consanguinity and positive family history predicted a higher diagnostic yield. In 5% (7/149) of cases, CES implicated novel candidate disease genes (MANF, GJA9, GLG1, COL15A1, SLC35F5, MAGE4, NEUROG1). CES uncovered two coexisting genetic disorders in 4% (6/149) and actionable incidental findings in 2% (3/149) of cases. Average time to diagnosis was reduced from 27 to 5 months. CES, which already has the highest diagnostic yield among all available diagnostic tools in the setting of Mendelian disorders, appears to be particularly helpful diagnostically in the highly consanguineous Middle Eastern population.

AB The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the field of cancer research has boosted worldwide efforts of genome-wide personalized oncology aiming at identifying predictive biomarkers and novel actionable targets. Despite considerable progress in understanding the molecular biology of distinct cancer entities by the use of this revolutionary technology and despite contemporaneous innovations in drug development, translation of NGS findings into improved concepts for cancer treatment remains a challenge. The aim of this article is to describe shortly the NGS platforms for DNA sequencing and in more detail key achievements and unresolved hurdles. A special focus will be given on potential clinical applications of this innovative technique in the field of radiation oncology.

AB PURPOSE: We determined the frequency of recurrent hotspot mutations in 46 cancer-related genes across tumor histologies in patients with advanced cancer.; METHODS: We reviewed data from 500 consecutive patients who underwent genomic profiling on an IRB-approved prospective clinical protocol in the Phase I program at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Archival tumor DNA was tested for 740 hotspot mutations in 46 genes (Ampli-Seq Cancer Panel; Life Technologies, CA).; RESULTS: Of the 500 patients, 362 had at least one reported mutation/variant. The most common likely somatic mutations were within TP53 (36%), KRAS (11%), and PIK3CA (9%) genes. Sarcoma (20%) and kidney (30%) had the lowest proportion of likely somatic mutations detected, while pancreas (100%), colorectal (89%), melanoma (86%), and endometrial (75%) had the highest. There was high concordance in 62 patients with paired primary tumors and metastases analyzed. 151 (30%) patients had alterations in potentially actionable genes. 37 tumor types were enrolled; both rare actionable mutations in common tumor types and actionable mutations in rare tumor types were identified.; CONCLUSION: Multiplex testing in the CLIA environment facilitates genomic characterization across multiple tumor lineages and identification of novel opportunities for genotype-driven trials.

AB Chemical perturbation screens offer the possibility toidentify actionable sets of cancer-specific vulnerabilities. However, most inhibitors of kinases or othercancer targets result in polypharmacological effects,which complicate the identification of target dependencies directly from the drug-response phenotypes. In this study, we developed a chemical systems biology approach that integrates comprehensive drug sensitivity and selectivity profiling to provide functional insights into both single and multi-target oncogenic signal addictions. When applied to 21 breast cancer cell lines, perturbed with 40 kinase inhibitors, the subtype-specific addiction patterns clustered in agreement with patient-derived subtypes, while showing considerable variability between the heterogeneous breast cancers. Experimental validation of the top predictions revealed a number of co-dependencies between kinase targets that led to unexpected synergistic combinations between their inhibitors, such as dasatinib and axitinib in the triple-negative basal-like HCC1937 cell line.

AB PURPOSE: Broad, hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS), as a clinical test, uses less tissue to identify more clinically relevant genomic alterations compared with profiling with multiple non-NGS tests. We set out to determine the frequency of such genomic alterations via this approach in tumors in which previous extensive non-NGS testing had not yielded a targetable driver alteration.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled patients with lung adenocarcinoma with a ≤ 15 pack-year smoking history whose tumors previously tested "negative" for alterations in 11 genes (mutations in EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, PIK3CA, and AKT1 and fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET) via multiple non-NGS methods. We performed hybridization capture of the coding exons of 287 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes and sequenced these to deep, uniform coverage.; RESULTS: Actionable genomic alterations with a targeted agent based on NCCN guidelines were identified in 26% [8 of 31: EGFR G719A, BRAF V600E, SOCS5-ALK, HIP1-ALK, CD74-ROS1, KIF5B-RET (n = 2), CCDC6-RET]. Seven of these patients either received or are candidates for targeted therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling using this method also identified a genomic alteration with a targeted agent available on a clinical trial in an additional 39% (12 of 31).; CONCLUSIONS: Broad, hybrid capture-based NGS identified actionable genomic alterations in 65% [95% confidence interval (CI), 48%-82%] of tumors from never or light smokers with lung cancers deemed without targetable genomic alterations by earlier extensive non-NGS testing. These findings support first-line profiling of lung adenocarcinomas using this approach as a more comprehensive and efficient strategy compared with non-NGS testing.

AB BACKGROUND: Ultra-deep targeted sequencing (UDT-Seq) has advanced our knowledge on the incidence and functional significance of somatic mutations. However, the utility of UDT-Seq in detecting copy number alterations (CNAs) remains unclear. With the goal of improving molecular prognostication and identifying new therapeutic targets, we designed this study to assess whether UDT-Seq may be useful for detecting CNA in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).; METHODS: We sequenced a panel of clinically actionable cancer mutations in 310 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded OSCC specimens. A linear model was developed to overcome uneven coverage across target regions and multiple samples. The 5-year rates of secondary primary tumors, local recurrence, neck recurrence, distant metastases, and survival served as the outcome measures. We confirmed the prognostic significance of the CNA signatures in an independent sample of 105 primary OSCC specimens.; RESULTS: The CNA burden across 10 targeted genes was found to predict prognosis in two independent cohorts. FGFR1 and PIK3CAamplifications were associated with prognosis independent of clinical risk factors. Genes exhibiting CNA were clustered in the proteoglycan metabolism, the FOXO signaling, and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, for which targeted drugs are already available or currently under development.; CONCLUSIONS: UDT-Seq is clinically useful to identify CNA, which significantly improve the prognostic information provided by traditional clinicopathological risk factors in OSCC patients.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical utility, diagnostic yield and rationale of integrating microarray analysis in the clinical diagnosis of hematological malignancies in comparison with classical chromosome karyotyping/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).; METHODS: G-banded chromosome analysis, FISH and microarray studies using customized CGH and CGH+SNP designs were performed on 27 samples from patients with hematological malignancies. A comprehensive comparison of the results obtained by three methods was conducted to evaluate benefits and limitations of these techniques for clinical diagnosis.; RESULTS: Overall, 89.7% of chromosomal abnormalities identified by karyotyping/FISH studies were also detectable by microarray. Among 183 acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) identified by microarray, 94 were additional findings revealed in 14 cases (52%), and at least 30% of CNAs were in genomic regions of diagnostic/prognostic significance. Approximately 30% of novel alterations detected by microarray were >20 Mb in size. Balanced abnormalities were not detected by microarray; however, of the 19 apparently "balanced" rearrangements, 55% (6/11) of recurrent and 13% (1/8) of non-recurrent translocations had alterations at the breakpoints discovered by microarray.; CONCLUSION: Microarray technology enables accurate, cost-effective and time-efficient whole-genome analysis at a resolution significantly higher than that of conventional karyotyping and FISH. Array-CGH showed advantage in identification of cryptic imbalances and detection of clonal aberrations in population of non-dividing cancer cells and samples with poor chromosome morphology. The integration of microarray analysis into the cytogenetic diagnosis of hematologic malignancies has the potential to improve patient management by providing clinicians with additional disease specific and potentially clinically actionable genomic alterations.
