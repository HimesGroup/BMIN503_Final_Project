AB Gaining insight into normal cellular signaling and disease biology is a critical goal of proteomic analyses. The ability to perform these studies successfully to extract the maximum value and discovery of biologically relevant candidate biomarkers is therefore of primary importance. Many successful studies in the past have focused on total proteome analysis (changes at the protein level) combined with phosphorylation analysis by metal affinity enrichment (changes at the PTM level). Here, we use the gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-45 treated with the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 and PKC inhibitor staurosporine to investigate the most efficient and most comprehensive strategies for both total protein and PTM analysis. Under the conditions used, total protein analysis yielded few changes in response to either compound, while analysis of phosphorylation identified thousands of sites that changed differentially between the two treatments. Both metal affinity and antibody-based enrichments were used to assess phosphopeptide changes, and the data generated by the two methods was largely complementary (non-overlapping). Label-free quantitation of peptide peak abundances was used to accurately determine fold-changes between control and treated samples. Protein interaction network analysis allowed the data to be placed in a biologically relevant context, and follow-up validation of selected findings confirmed the accuracy of the proteomic data. Together, this study provides a framework for start-to-finish proteomic analysis of any experimental system under investigation to maximize the value of the proteomic study and yield the best chance for uncovering actionable target candidates.

AB BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of Web-based social media in recent years has impacted how patients share health-related information. However, little work has studied the demographics of these users.; OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the demographics of users who participate in health-related Web-based social outlets to identify possible links to health care disparities.; METHODS: We analyze and compare three different types of health-related social outlets: (1) general Web-based social networks, Twitter and Google+, (2) drug review websites, and (3) health Web forums. We focus on the following demographic attributes: age, gender, ethnicity, location, and writing level. We build and evaluate domain-specific classifiers to infer missing data where possible. The estimated demographic statistics are compared against various baselines, such as Internet and social networks usage of the population.; RESULTS: We found that (1) drug review websites and health Web forums are dominated by female users, (2) the participants of health-related social outlets are generally older with the exception of the 65+ years bracket, (3) blacks are underrepresented in health-related social networks, (4) users in areas with better access to health care participate more in Web-based health-related social outlets, and (5) the writing level of users in health-related social outlets is significantly lower than the reading level of the population.; CONCLUSIONS: We identified interesting and actionable disparities in the participation of various demographic groups to various types of health-related social outlets. These disparities are significantly distinct from the disparities in Internet usage or general social outlets participation.

AB Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare chronic and ultimately fatal disease resulting in an aberrant scarring and thickening of lung tissue. Molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of IPF are still unknown and till now no effective therapy is known to really improve disease's outcome. A deeper understanding of IPF biology is now mandatory to clarify IPF origin in order to identify actionable targets. Here we discuss and analyze the data presented by a recent paper published by De Pianto et al. on the prestigious respiratory journal Thorax. The work is focused on how gene expression analysis can be applied to stratify IPF cases based on their risk of disease progression. Moreover they tried to match genetic and phenotypic profiles in order to predict therapeutic response and patients' prognosis.

AB Improving quality of care in lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and in the United States, is a major public health challenge. Such improvement requires accurate and meaningful measurement of quality of care. Preliminary indicators have been derived from clinical practice guidelines and expert opinions, but there are few standard sets of quality of care measures for lung cancer in the United States or elsewhere. Research to develop validated evidence-based quality of care measures is critical in promoting population improvement initiatives in lung cancer. Furthermore, novel research designs beyond the traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed for wide-scale applications of quality improvement and should extend into alternative designs such as quasi-experimental designs, rigorous observational studies, population modeling, and other pragmatic study designs. We discuss several study design options to aid the development of practical, actionable, and measurable quality standards for lung cancer care. We also provide examples of ongoing pragmatic studies for the dissemination and implementation of lung cancer quality improvement interventions in community settings.

AB Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are an uncommon family of soft tissue tumors with dual myoid-melanocytic differentiation. Although PEComa family tumors commonly demonstrate a perivascular growth pattern, pericyte antigen expression has not yet been examined among this unique tumor group. Previously, we demonstrated that a subset of perivascular soft tissue tumors exhibit a striking pericytic immunophenotype, with diffuse expression of alphaSMA, CD146, and PDGFRbeta. Here, we describe the presence of pericyte antigens across a diverse group of PEComa family tumors (n=19 specimens). Results showed that pericyte antigens differed extensively by histological appearance. Typical angiomyolipoma (AML) specimens showed variable expression of pericyte antigens among both perivascular and myoid-appearing cells. In contrast, AML specimens with a predominant spindled morphology showed diffuse expression of pericyte markers, including alphaSMA, CD146, and PDGFRbeta. AML samples with predominant epithelioid morphology showed a marked reduction in or the absence of immunoreactivity for pericyte markers. Lymphangiomyoma samples showed more variable and partial pericyte marker expression. In summary, pericyte antigen expression is variable among PEComa family tumors and largely varies by tumor morphology. Pericytic marker expression in PEComa may represent a true pericytic cell of origin, or alternatively aberrant pericyte marker adoption. Markers of pericytic differentiation may be of future diagnostic utility for the evaluation of mesenchymal tumors, or identify actionable signaling pathways for future therapeutic intervention.

AB Pathologists using their routine diagnostic tools can contribute both to the care of patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and to understanding the pathobiology of the tumors. They can document details of tissue organization and cytology that are accessible only by microscopy and can characterize admixtures of cell types that are morphologically distinct or show differential expression of immunohistochemical markers. Current roles and challenges for pathologists include differential diagnosis, identifying clues to the presence of hereditary disease, and effective communication of pathology information for clinical and research purposes. Future roles will increasingly involve risk stratification, identification of actionable targets for personalized therapies, and aiding the interpretation of molecular tests by helping characterize genetic variants of unknown significance. It remains to be determined to what extent the need for pathology input will be overshadowed by the availability of genetic testing and other molecular analyses at ever-decreasing cost, together with very effective clinical paradigms for risk stratification and patient care.  © 2015 Society for Endocrinology.

AB PURPOSE: Clinical testing for germ-line variation in multiple cancer susceptibility genes is available using massively parallel sequencing. Limited information is available for pretest genetic counseling regarding the spectrum of mutations and variants of uncertain significance in defined patient populations.; METHODS: We performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 22 cancer susceptibility genes in 278 BRCA1/2-negative patients with early-onset breast cancer (diagnosed at younger than 40 years of age).; RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (11%) were found to have at least one deleterious or likely deleterious variant. Seven patients (2.5% overall) were found to have deleterious or likely deleterious variants in genes for which clinical guidelines exist for management, namely TP53 (4), CDKN2A (1), MSH2 (1), and MUTYH (double heterozygote). Twenty-four patients (8.6%) had deleterious or likely deleterious variants in a cancer susceptibility gene for which clinical guidelines are lacking, such as CHEK2 and ATM. Fifty-four patients (19%) had at least one variant of uncertain significance, and six patients were heterozygous for a variant in MUTYH.; CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that massively parallel sequencing identifies reportable variants in known cancer susceptibility genes in more than 30% of patients with early-onset breast cancer. However, only few patients (2.5%) have definitively actionable mutations given current clinical management guidelines.Genet Med 17 8, 630-638.

The purpose of this article is to describe the Data-to-Action framework, a process that guides practitioners through rapid-feedback cycles in order to generate actionable data to improve implementation of ongoing programs. The framework was designed while implementing DELTA PREP, a 3-year project aimed at building the primary prevention capacities of statewide domestic violence coalitions. The authors describe the framework's main steps and provide a case example of a rapid-feedback cycle and several examples of rapid-feedback memos produced during the project period.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present article proposes a general framework and a set of specific methodological steps for conducting person-specific dynamic assessments, which yield information about syndrome structures and states that can be used to provide actionable information for the formulation of personalized interventions. It is proposed that researchers should (a) determine the relevant constituent inputs for a diagnostic system; (b) measure these inputs with as much detail as possible; (c) assess the correlational structure of system inputs via factor-analytic methods within individuals; and (d) subject the individual-level, latent dimension time series to dynamic analyses such as the dynamic factor model (Molenaar, 1985) to discern the time-dependent, dynamic relationships within and between system components.; METHOD: An exemplar is provided wherein 10 individuals with clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder completed surveys related to generalized anxiety disorder symptomatology for at least 60 consecutive days. These data were then subjected to person-specific exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for the identification of latent symptom dimensions. Finally, dynamic factor models were used to model the dynamic interrelationships within and between symptom domains on a person-by-person basis.; RESULTS: Person-specific factor analyses returned models with 3 (n = 8) or 4 (n = 2) latent factors, all with excellent fit. Dynamic factor modeling successfully revealed the contemporaneous correlations and time-lagged predictive relationships between factors, providing prescriptive information for the formulation of targeted interventions.; CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach has the potential to inform the construction and implementation of personalized treatments by delineating the idiosyncratic structure of psychopathology on a person-by-person basis.

AB BACKGROUND: Companion diagnostic tests (CDTs) have emerged as a vital technology in the effective use of an increasing number of targeted drug therapies. Although CDTs can offer a multitude of potential benefits, assessing their value within a health technology appraisal process can be challenging because of a complex array of factors that influence clinical and economic outcomes.; OBJECTIVE: To develop a user-friendly tool to assist managed care and other health care decision makers in screening companion tests and determining whether an intensive technology review is necessary and, if so, where the review should be focused to improve efficiency.; METHODS: First, we conducted a systematic literature review of CDT cost-effectiveness studies to identify value drivers. Second, we conducted key informant interviews with a diverse group of stakeholders to elicit feedback and solicit any additional value drivers and identify desirable attributes for an evidence review tool. A draft tool was developed based on this information that captured value drivers, usability features, and had a particular focus on practical use by nonexperts. Finally, the tool was pilot tested with test developers and managed care evidence evaluators to assess face-validity and usability. The tool was also evaluated using several diverse examples of existing companion diagnostics and refined accordingly.; RESULTS: We identified 65 cost-effectiveness studies of companion diagnostic technologies. The following factors were most commonly identified as value drivers from our literature review: clinical validity of testing; efficacy, safety, and cost of baseline and alternative treatments; cost and mortality of health states; and biomarker prevalence and testing cost. Stakeholders identified the following additional factors that they believed influenced the overall value of a companion test: regulatory status, actionability, utility, and market penetration. These factors were used to maximize the efficiency of the evidence review process. Stakeholders also stated that a tool should be easy to use and time efficient. Cognitive interviews with stakeholders led to minor changes in the draft tool to improve usability and relevance. The final tool consisted of 4 sections: (1) eligibility for review (2 questions), (2) prioritization of review (3 questions), (3) clinical review (3 questions), and (4) economic review (5 questions).; CONCLUSIONS: Although the evaluation of CDTs can be challenging because of limited evidence and the added complexity of incorporating a diagnostic test into drug treatment decisions, using a pragmatic tool to identify tests that do not need extensive evaluation may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CDT value assessments.

AB Devastating brain injuries (DBIs) profoundly damage cerebral function and frequently cause death. DBI survivors admitted to critical care will suffer both intracranial and extracranial effects from their brain injury. The indicators of quality care in DBI are not completely defined, and despite best efforts many patients will not survive, although others may have better outcomes than originally anticipated. Inaccuracies in prognostication can result in premature termination of life support, thereby biasing outcomes research and creating a self-fulfilling cycle where the predicted course is almost invariably dismal. Because of the potential complexities and controversies involved in the management of devastating brain injury, the Neurocritical Care Society organized a panel of expert clinicians from neurocritical care, neuroanesthesia, neurology, neurosurgery, emergency medicine, nursing, and pharmacy to develop an evidence-based guideline with practice recommendations. The panel intends for this guideline to be used by critical care physicians, neurologists, emergency physicians, and other health professionals, with specific emphasis on management during the first 72-h post-injury. Following an extensive literature review, the panel used the GRADE methodology to evaluate the robustness of the data. They made actionable recommendations based on the quality of evidence, as well as on considerations of risk: benefit ratios, cost, and user preference. The panel generated recommendations regarding prognostication, psychosocial issues, and ethical considerations.

AB Recent advances in multi-omics approaches encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics offer hitherto unprecedented insights on common complex human diseases. A unique angle pertinent for both diagnostic and therapeutic sciences involves rethinking clinically distinct diseases with a view to their shared molecular targets, interactomes, and pathophysiologies. Reflecting at a scale of disease-to-disease associations might help clinicians, public health practitioners, drug and biotechnology developers, and associated knowledge industries in the current era. This review article examines the hypothesis that "Intersecting Molecular Pathways Permit Interventions on Multiple Clinical Endpoints", thus uniquely bringing together Crohn's disease and periodontitis. Furthermore, we propose a novel connector molecular target between these two ostensibly distinct diseases at a clinical level, human beta defensin (hBD)-2, and suggest pathways by which hBD-2 can conceivably connect Crohn's disease and periodontitis by virtue of regulating the innate-immune response. We conclude by emphasizing different approaches where hBD-2 can be employed as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool to improve the quality of life of susceptible individuals and minimize the economic costs of these two major global public health problems. The strategy presented here also presents potentials for targeting of multiple diseases through a unique "nodal molecular target" that "speaks to" multiple clinical endpoints.

AB Leptospirosis is a potentially severe illness in returned travelers. Patients often present with fever, headache, and neck pain, which may lead to a workup for meningitis including the acquisition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although Leptospira DNA has been detected in CSF by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), little data exist regarding the utility of testing CSF in addition to serum or plasma obtained on presentation. In this report, we present two cases of leptospirosis in returned travelers presenting with fever and headache. Our first patient had neutrophilic meningitis, and Leptospira was detectable only in CSF obtained on admission. The second patient had a normal CSF profile, but Leptospira was detected in CSF at a bacterial load 5- to 10-fold higher than that in plasma. CSF is an important specimen for the diagnosis of Leptospira by molecular methods and may yield an actionable diagnosis in the absence of leptospiremia.  © The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB PURPOSE: Acute severe lymphopenia (ASL) frequently develops during radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) for high-grade glioma (HGG) and is associated with decreased survival. The current study was designed to identify potential predictors of ASL, with a focus on actionable RT-specific dosimetric parameters.; METHODS AND MATERIALS: From January 2007 to December 2012, 183 patients with HGG were treated with RT+TMZ and had available data including total lymphocyte count (TLC) and radiation dose-volume histogram parameters. ASL was defined as TLC of <500/muL within the first 3months from the start of RT. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine the most important predictors of ASL.; RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (29%) developed ASL. Patients with ASL had significantly worse overall survival than those without (median: 12.5 vs 20.2months, respectively, P<.001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 5.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.46-11.41), older age (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02-1.09), lower baseline TLC (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87-0.98), and higher brain volume receiving 25 Gy (V25Gy) (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.003-1.05) as the most significant predictors for ASL. Brain V25Gy <56% appeared to be the optimal threshold (OR:2.36; 95% CI: 1.11-5.01), with an ASL rate of 38% versus 20% above and below this threshold, respectively (P=.006).; CONCLUSIONS: Female sex, older age, lower baseline TLC, and higher brain V25Gy are significant predictors of ASL during RT+TMZ therapy for HGG. Maintaining the V25Gy of brain below 56% may reduce the risk of ASL. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cancer management decisions are currently informed by cancer type and clinical stage, as well as age, health condition, and individual patient needs. Cancer is a genetic disease and recent genomic studies have revealed the genomic landscape of multiple tumour types. This has led to readily available catalogues of genomic features for many cancers and efforts to incorporate such information into treatment decisions. From this has evolved the concept that mutation-based taxonomies may supersede the current cell of origin-based categorization of neoplasia. Unfortunately, genomic features as clinically actionable information may not be directly transferable between tumour types, due to the importance of cellular and genomic context. However, we believe that high-level views of different genomic landscapes could broadly inform research study design and treatment strategies. Herein, we use ovarian and bone cancer as examples to propose a genomic complexity-based categorization for cancer. In addition to informing clinical study design, we describe how this categorization scheme could impact (i) improvement of accuracy of histological diagnoses, (ii) stratification of patients for targeted therapies, (iii) research study design, and (iv) personalized treatment strategies.

AB PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic yield and the practicality of implementing whole exome sequencing within a clinical ophthalmology setting.; DESIGN: Evaluation of a diagnostic protocol.; METHODS: setting: Patient participants were enrolled during clinical appointments in a university-based ophthalmic genetics clinic.; PATIENT POPULATION: Twenty-six patients with a variety of presumed hereditary retinal dystrophies.; INTERVENTION: Participants were offered whole exome sequencing in addition to clinically available sequencing gene panels between July 2012 and January 2013 to determine the molecular etiology of their retinal dystrophy.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic yield and acceptability of whole exome sequencing in patients with retinal disorders.; RESULTS: Twenty-six of 29 eligible patients (90%) who were approached opted to undergo molecular testing. Each participant chose whole exome sequencing in addition to, or in lieu of, clinically available sequencing gene panels. Time to obtain informed consent was manageable in the clinical context. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified known pathogenic mutations or suspected deleterious variants in 57.7% of participants. Additionally, 1 participant had 2 autosomal dominant medically actionable incidental findings (unrelated to retinopathy) that were reported to enable the participant to take preventive action and reduce risk for future disease.; CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified the molecular etiology for more than half of all participants. Additionally, we found that participants were widely accepting of whole exome sequencing and the possibility of being informed about medically actionable incidental findings.

AB Studies among adolescents have shown that several important interpersonal, intrapersonal and environmental factors are associated with smoking behaviour. The current qualitative research project aimed to explore the determinants of smoking initiation and maintenance, from a youth perspective, among young people who smoked, living in a multi-ethnic Asian country. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with youths in Singapore in youth-friendly and accessible locations. Young people, from a variety of social contexts-varying on age, gender, ethnicity and educational level, were included in the study. All FGDs were conducted in English and participants were recruited using a mix of network and purposive sampling. All FGDs were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, allowing themes to emerge from the data with the goal of answering the research question. Ninety-one youth smokers (54 males, 37 females), aged between 14 to 29 years, participated in the study. The majority were males (59%) and of Chinese ethnicity (52%). Participants identified multiple personal, social, and familial influences on young adults' smoking behaviors. Peer and family influences, as well as risk minimization, played a key role in smoking initiation and maintenance. While young people were aware of policies that restricted smoking, these did not directly affect their decision to start smoking. The theory of triadic influence provided a promising theoretical framework to understand smoking initiation and maintenance in a sample of young adult smokers from a multi-ethnic Asian country. It also provides actionable information for initiatives to prevent smoking in young people, which includes their perspectives and emphasizes an inclusive approach without stigmatizing those who smoke.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a major cause of female mortality worldwide. This study has examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway markers that represent actionable pharmacological targets.; METHODS: HPV16 positive CSCCs (n = 105 patients) from Madhya Pradesh, India were screened for KRAS and PIK3CA mutations by PNA-clamp real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for EGFR, PIK3CA, PTEN, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR and phospho-44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2).; RESULTS: KRAS mutations were detected in 0/91 (0%) and PIK3CA mutations in 19/95 (20.0%) informative specimens: exon 9, E542 (n = 3) and E545 (n = 15); exon 20, H1047R (n = 1). PIK3CA mutation detection was associated with older mean patient age [48.2 vs. 56.6 years (P = 0.007)] and with post-menopausal age: 5/45 (11.1%) patients <50 years vs. 14/50 (28.0%) patients ≥50 years (P = 0.045; OR = 3.11). EGFR expression was present in 60/101 (59.4%) CSCCs and was associated with PIK3CA mutation detection (P < 0.05) but not age (P > 0.05). EGFR and phospho-AKT staining showed associations with tumor grade and/or lymph node status (P < 0.05). Significant associations were not found for the other study markers (P > 0.05).; CONCLUSION: These data show that PIK3CA mutation acquisition is related to patient age and EGFR expression. The absence of KRAS mutations supports the potential of anti-EGFR therapies for CSCC treatment. The relatively high PIK3CA mutation rates indicate that PI3K may be a therapeutic target for a significant subset of CSCC patients. Qualitatively distinct IHC staining profiles for the marker panel were noted patient to patient; however, across patients, consistent linear relationships between up- and downstream pathway markers were not observed. Evaluation of the expression status of potential cancer pathway targets may be of value in addition to molecular profiling for choosing among therapeutic options.

AB BACKGROUND: Mental illness is prevalent across the globe and affects multiple aspects of life. Despite advances in treatment, there is little evidence that prevalence rates of mental illness are falling. While the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancers are common in the policy dialogue and in service delivery, the prevention of mental illness remains a neglected area. There is accumulating evidence that mental illness is at least partially preventable, with increasing recognition that its antecedents are often found in infancy, childhood, adolescence and youth, creating multiple opportunities into young adulthood for prevention. Developing valid and reproducible methods for translating the evidence base in mental illness prevention into actionable policy recommendations is a crucial step in taking the prevention agenda forward.; METHOD: Building on an aetiological model of adult mental illness that emphasizes the importance of intervening during infancy, childhood, adolescence and youth, we adapted a workforce and service planning framework, originally applied to diabetes care, to the analysis of the workforce and service structures required for best-practice prevention of mental illness.; RESULTS: The resulting framework consists of 6 steps that include identifying priority risk factors, profiling the population in terms of these risk factors to identify at-risk groups, matching these at-risk groups to best-practice interventions, translation of these interventions to competencies, translation of competencies to workforce and service estimates, and finally, exploring the policy implications of these workforce and services estimates. The framework outlines the specific tasks involved in translating the evidence-base in prevention, to clearly actionable workforce, service delivery and funding recommendations.; CONCLUSIONS: The framework describes the means to deliver mental illness prevention that the literature indicates is achievable, and is the basis of an ongoing project to model the workforce and service structures required for mental illness prevention.

AB BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide challenge. Practice guidelines promote structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for informing health care providers about glycemic control and providing patient feedback to increase knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavior change. Paired glucose testingpairs of glucose results obtained before and after a meal or physical activityis a method of structured SMBG. However, frequent access to glucose data to interpret values and recommend actions is challenging. A complete feedback loopdata collection and interpretation combined with feedback to modify treatmenthas been associated with improved outcomes, yet there remains limited integration of SMBG feedback in diabetes management. Incorporating telehealth remote monitoring and asynchronous electronic health record (EHR) feedback from certified diabetes educators (CDEs)specialists in glucose pattern managementemploy the complete feedback loop to improve outcomes.; OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a telehealth remote monitoring intervention using paired glucose testing and asynchronous data analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary aim was change in glycated hemoglobin (A(1c))a measure of overall glucose managementbetween groups after 6 months. The secondary aims were change in self-reported Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA), Diabetes Empowerment Scale, and Diabetes Knowledge Test.; METHODS: A 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing usual care to telehealth remote monitoring with paired glucose testing and asynchronous virtual visits. Participants were aged 30-70 years, not using insulin with A1c levels between 7.5% and 10.9% (58-96 mmol/mol). The telehealth remote monitoring tablet computer transmitted glucose data and facilitated a complete feedback loop to educate participants, analyze actionable glucose data, and provide feedback. Data from paired glucose testing were analyzed asynchronously using computer-assisted pattern analysis and were shared with patients via the EHR weekly. CDEs called participants monthly to discuss paired glucose testing trends and treatment changes. Separate mixed-effects models were used to analyze data.; RESULTS: Participants (N=90) were primarily white (64%, 56/87), mean age 58 (SD 11) years, mean body mass index 34.1 (SD 6.7) kg/m2, with diabetes for mean 8.2 (SD 5.4) years, and a mean A(1c) of 8.3% (SD 1.1; 67 mmol/mol). Both groups lowered A(1c) with an estimated average decrease of 0.70 percentage points in usual care group and 1.11 percentage points in the treatment group with a significant difference of 0.41 percentage points at 6 months (SE 0.08, t159=-2.87, P=.005). Change in medication (SE 0.21, t157=-3.37, P=.009) was significantly associated with lower A(1c) level. The treatment group significantly improved on the SDSCA subscales carbohydrate spacing (P=.04), monitoring glucose (P=.001), and foot care (P=.02).; CONCLUSIONS: An eHealth model incorporating a complete feedback loop with telehealth remote monitoring and paired glucose testing with asynchronous data analysis significantly improved A(1c) levels compared to usual care.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01715649; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01715649 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6ZinLl8D0).

AB The molecular characterization of tumors using next generation sequencing (NGS) is an emerging diagnostic tool that is quickly becoming an integral part of clinical decision making. Cancer genomic profiling involves significant challenges including DNA quality and quantity, tumor heterogeneity, and the need to detect a wide variety of complex genetic mutations. Most available comprehensive diagnostic tests rely on primer based amplification or probe based capture methods coupled with NGS to detect hotspot mutation sites or whole regions implicated in disease. These tumor panels utilize highly customized bioinformatics pipelines to perform the difficult task of accurately calling cancer relevant alterations such as single nucleotide variations, small indels or large genomic alterations from the NGS data. In this review, we will discuss the challenges of solid tumor assay design/analysis and report a case study that highlights the need to include complementary technologies (i.e., arrays) and germline analysis in tumor testing to reliably identify copy number alterations and actionable variants.

AB Missense mutations in p53 generate aberrant proteins with abrogated tumour suppressor functions that can also acquire oncogenic gain-of-function activities that promote malignant progression, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins undergo massive constitutive stabilization specifically in tumours, which is the key requisite for the acquisition of gain-of-functions activities. Although currently 11 million patients worldwide live with tumours expressing highly stabilized mutp53, it is unknown whether mutp53 is a therapeutic target in vivo. Here we use a novel mutp53 mouse model expressing an inactivatable R248Q hotspot mutation (floxQ) to show that tumours depend on sustained mutp53 expression. Upon tamoxifen-induced mutp53 ablation, allotransplanted and autochthonous tumours curb their growth, thus extending animal survival by 37%, and advanced tumours undergo apoptosis and tumour regression or stagnation. The HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery, which is significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal tissues, is a major determinant of mutp53 stabilization. We show that long-term HSP90 inhibition significantly extends the survival of mutp53 Q/- (R248Q allele) and H/H (R172H allele) mice by 59% and 48%, respectively, but not their corresponding p53(-/-) littermates. This mutp53-dependent drug effect occurs in H/H mice treated with 17DMAG+SAHA and in H/H and Q/- mice treated with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. Notably, drug activity correlates with induction of mutp53 degradation, tumour apoptosis and prevention of T-cell lymphomagenesis. These proof-of-principle data identify mutp53 as an actionable cancer-specific drug target.

AB PURPOSE: Adenocarcinoma is the most dominant type of lung cancer in never-smoker patients. The risk alleles from genome-wide association studies have small odds ratios and unclear biologic roles. Here we have taken an approach featuring suitable medical actionability to identify alleles with low population frequency but high disease-causing potential.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed for a family with an unusually high density of lung adenocarcinoma with available DNA from the affected mother, four affected daughters, and one nonaffected son. Candidate risk alleles were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy. Validation was conducted in an external cohort of 1,135 participants without cancer and 1,312 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Family follow-ups were performed by genotyping the relatives of the original proband and the relatives of the identified risk-allele carriers. Low-dose computed tomography scans of the chest were evaluated for lung abnormalities.; RESULTS: YAP1 R331W missense mutation from the original family was identified and validated in the external controls and the cohort with lung adenocarcinoma. The YAP1 mutant-allele carrier frequency was 1.1% in patients with lung adenocarcinoma compared with 0.18% in controls (P = .0095), yielding an odds ratio (adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status) of 5.9. Among the relatives, YAP1-mutant carriers have overwhelmingly higher frequencies of developing lung adenocarcinoma or ground-glass opacity lung lesions than those who do not carry the mutation (10:0 v 1:7; P < .001). YAP1 mutation was shown to increase the colony formation ability and invasion potential of lung cancer cells.; CONCLUSION: These results implicated YAP1 R331W as an allele predisposed for lung adenocarcinoma with high familial penetrance. Low-dose computed tomography scans may be recommended to this subpopulation, which is at high risk for lung cancer, for personalized prevention and health management. © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB Those planning, managing and working in health systems worldwide routinely need to make decisions regarding strategies to improve health care and promote equity. Systematic reviews of different kinds can be of great help to these decision-makers, providing actionable evidence at every step in the decision-making process. Although there is growing recognition of the importance of systematic reviews to inform both policy decisions and produce guidance for health systems, a number of important methodological and evidence uptake challenges remain and better coordination of existing initiatives is needed. The Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, housed within the World Health Organization, convened an Advisory Group on Health Systems Research (HSR) Synthesis to bring together different stakeholders interested in HSR synthesis and its use in decision-making processes. We describe the rationale of the Advisory Group and the six areas of its work and reflects on its role in advancing the field of HSR synthesis. We argue in favour of greater cross-institutional collaborations, as well as capacity strengthening in low- and middle-income countries, to advance the science and practice of health systems research synthesis. We advocate for the integration of quasi-experimental study designs in reviews of effectiveness of health systems intervention and reforms. The Advisory Group also recommends adopting priority-setting approaches for HSR synthesis and increasing the use of findings from systematic reviews in health policy and decision-making.

AB Integrated clinical care models, like Accountable Care Organizations and ESRD Seamless Care Organizations, present new opportunities for dialysis facility medical directors to affect changes in care that result in improved patient outcomes. Currently, there is little scholarly information on what role the medical director should play. In this opinion-based review, it is predicted that dialysis providers, the hospitals in which the medical director and staff physicians practice, and the payers with which they contract are going to insist that, as care becomes more integrated, dialysis facility medical directors participate in new ways to improve quality and decrease the costs of care. Six broad areas are proposed where dialysis unit medical directors can have the greatest effect on shifting the quality-care paradigm where integrated care models are used. The medical director will need to develop an awareness of the regional medical care delivery system, collect and analyze actionable data, determine patient outcomes to be targeted that are mutually agreed on by participating physicians and institutions, develop processes of care that result in improved patient outcomes, and lead and inform the medical staff. Three practical examples of patient-centered, quality-focused programs developed and implemented by dialysis unit medical directors and their practice partners that targeted dialysis access, modality choice, and fluid volume management are presented. Medical directors are encouraged to move beyond traditional roles and embrace responsibilities associated with integrated care.  Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Nephrology.

AB KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer. Despite substantial efforts, no clinically applicable strategy has yet been developed to effectively treat KRAS-mutant tumors. Here, we perform a cell-line-based screen and identify strong synergistic interactions between cell-cycle checkpoint-abrogating Chk1- and MK2 inhibitors, specifically in KRAS- and BRAF-driven cells. Mechanistically, we show that KRAS-mutant cancer displays intrinsic genotoxic stress, leading to tonic Chk1- and MK2 activity. We demonstrate that simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition leads to mitotic catastrophe in KRAS-mutant cells. This actionable synergistic interaction is validated using xenograft models, as well as distinct Kras- or Braf-driven autochthonous murine cancer models. Lastly, we show that combined checkpoint inhibition induces apoptotic cell death in KRAS- or BRAF-mutant tumor cells directly isolated from patients. These results strongly recommend simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of KRAS- or BRAF-driven cancers.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB INTRODUCTION: This article examines the development and pilot implementation of an approach to support local community decision-makers to plan health adaptation responses to climate change. The approach involves health and wellbeing risk assessment supported through the use of an electronic tool. While climate change is a major foreseeable public health threat, the extent to which health services are prepared for, or able to adequately respond to, climate change impact-related risks remains unclear. Building health decision-support mechanisms in order to involve and empower local stakeholders to help create the basis for agreement on these adaptive actions is an important first step. The primary research question was 'What can be learned from pilot implementation of a community health and well-being risk assessment (CHWRA) information technology-based tool designed to support understanding of, and decision-making on, local community challenges and opportunities associated with health risks posed by climate change?; METHODS: The article examines the complexity of climate change science to adaptation translational processes, with reference to existing research literature on community development. This is done in the context of addressing human health risks for rural and remote communities in Tasmania, Australia. This process is further examined through the pilot implementation of an electronic tool designed to support the translation of physically based climate change impact information into community-level assessments of health risks and adaptation priorities. The procedural and technical nature of the CHWRA tool is described, and the implications of the data gathered from stakeholder workshops held at three rural Tasmanian local government sites are considered and discussed.; RESULTS: Bushfire, depression and waterborne diseases were identified by community stakeholders as being potentially 'catastrophic' health effects 'likely' to 'almost certain' to occur at one or more Tasmanian rural sites - based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change style of assessment. Consensus statements from stakeholders also suggested concern with health sector adaptation capacity and community resilience, and what community stakeholders defined as 'last straw' climate effects in already stressed communities. Preventative action and community engagement were also seen as important, especially with regard to managing the ways that climate change can multiply socioeconomic and health outcome inequality. Above all, stakeholder responses emphasised the importance of an applied, complexity-oriented understanding of how climate and climate change impacts affect local communities and local services to compromise the overall quality of human health in these communities.; CONCLUSIONS: Complex community-level assessments about climate change and related health risks and responses can be captured electronically in ways that offer potentially actionable information about priorities for health sector adaptation, as a first step in planning. What is valuable about these community judgements is the creation of shared values and commitments. Future iteration of the IT tool could include decision-support modules to support best practice health sector adaptation scenarios, providing participants with opportunities to develop their know-how about health sector adaptation to climate change. If managed carefully, such tools could work within a balanced portfolio of measures to help reduce the rising health burden from climate change.

AB Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) comprises heterogeneous tumors with predominant hypoxic components, a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment and determinant of resistance to cytotoxic therapies, local recurrence, and metastatic progression. A rational integration of molecularly targeted agents in established combined-modality treatment regimens may improve local and systemic disease control, but will require a clear definition of functional biomarkers for patient stratification. In a prospective study of LARC patients given neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, we applied a kinase substrate array technology to analyze the patients' tumor biopsies sampled at the time of diagnosis, and observed that receptor tyrosine kinase activities integrated by high phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling were correlated both with poor tumor response to the neoadjuvant treatment and adverse progression-free survival. Conceptually, the specific tumor signature of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling activity may point to actionable therapy targets in LARC patients with unfavorable disease features.

AB Despite significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases in the last two decades, there is still a significant proportion where a causative mutation cannot be identified and a definitive genetic diagnosis remains elusive. New genome-wide or high-throughput multiple gene tests have brought new hope to the field, since they can offer fast, cost-effective and comprehensive analysis of genetic variation. This is particularly interesting in disorders with high genetic heterogeneity. There are, however, limitations and concerns regarding the implementation of genomic analysis in everyday clinical practice, including some particular to emerging and developing economies, as Brazil. They include the limited number of actionable genetic variants known to date, difficulties in determining the clinical validity and utility of novel variants, growth of direct-to-consumer genetic testing using a genomic approach and lack of proper training of health care professionals to adequately request, interpret and use genetic information. Despite all these concerns and limitations, the availability of genomic tests has grown at an extremely rapid pace and commercially available services include initiatives in almost all areas of clinical genetics, including newborn and carrier screening. We discuss the benefits and limitations of genomic testing, as well as the ethical implications and the challenges for genetic education and enough available and qualified health care professionals, to ensure the adequate process of informed consent, meaningful interpretation and use of genomic data and definition of a clear regulatory framework in the particular context of Brazil.

AB BACKGROUND: Randomized trials must be of high methodological quality to yield credible, actionable findings. The main aim of this project was to evaluate whether there has been an improvement in the methodological quality of randomized trials published in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association (JAPMA).; METHODS: Randomized trials published in JAPMA during a 15-year period (January 1999 to December 2013) were evaluated. The methodological quality of randomized trials was evaluated using the PEDro scale (scores range from 0 to 10, with 0 being lowest quality). Linear regression was used to assess changes in methodological quality over time.; RESULTS: A total of 1,143 articles were published in JAPMA between January 1999 and December 2013. Of these, 44 articles were reports of randomized trials. Although the number of randomized trials published each year increased, there was only minimal improvement in their methodological quality (mean rate of improvement = 0.01 points per year). The methodological quality of the trials studied was typically moderate, with a mean ± SD PEDro score of 5.1 ± 1.5. Although there were a few high-quality randomized trials published in the journal, most (84.1%) scored between 3 and 6.; CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been an increase in the number of randomized trials published in JAPMA, there is substantial opportunity for improvement in the methodological quality of trials published in the journal. Researchers seeking to publish reports of randomized trials should seek to meet current best-practice standards in the conduct and reporting of their trials.

AB BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to prescribed evidence-based medications after acute myocardial infarction (MI) can contribute to worse outcomes and higher costs. We sought to better understand the modifiable factors contributing to early nonadherence of evidence-based medications after acute MI.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 7425 acute MI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention at 216 US hospitals participating in TReatment with ADP receptor iNhibitorS: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) between April 2010 and May 2012. Using the validated Morisky instrument to assess cardiovascular medication adherence at 6 weeks post MI, we stratified patients into self-reported high (score, 8), moderate (score, 6-7), and low (score, <6) adherence groups. Moderate and low adherence was reported in 25% and 4% of patients, respectively. One third of low adherence patients described missing doses of antiplatelet therapy at least twice a week after percutaneous coronary intervention. Signs of depression and patient-reported financial hardship because of medication expenses were independently associated with a higher likelihood of medication nonadherence. Patients were more likely to be adherent at 6 weeks if they had follow-up appointments made before discharge and had a provider explain potential side effects of their medications. Lower medication adherence may be associated with a higher risk of 3-month death/readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.87) although this did not reach statistical significance.; CONCLUSIONS: Even early after MI, a substantial proportion of patients report suboptimal adherence to prescribed medications. Tailored patient education and pre discharge planning may represent actionable opportunities to optimize patient adherence and clinical outcomes.; CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

AB In this era of precision medicine, our understanding and knowledge of the molecular landscape associated with lung cancer pathogenesis continues to evolve. This information is being increasingly exploited to treat advanced stage lung cancer patients with tailored, targeted therapy. During the management of these patients, minimally invasive procedures to obtain samples for tissue diagnoses are desirable. Cytologic fine-needle aspirates are often utilized for this purpose and are important not only for rendering diagnoses to subtype patients' lung cancers, but also for ascertaining molecular diagnostic information for treatment purposes. Thus, cytologic fine-needle aspirates must be utilized and triaged judiciously to achieve both objectives. In this review, strategies in utilizing fine-needle aspirates will be discussed in the context of our current understanding of the clinically actionable molecular aberrations underlying non-small cell lung cancer and the molecular assays applied to these samples in order to obtain treatment-relevant molecular diagnostic information.

AB Despite 35 y of dietary guidance, there has been no substantial shift in consumer compliance. Consumers report that they seek information on nutrition and healthy eating, but most are not paying attention to dietary recommendations. For guidance to be effective, it must be realistic. Even with increasingly detailed nutrition information and evidence that diet affects health outcomes, convenience and taste remain the strongest determinants of food choices. It is up to health educators to clear up confusion and give consumers control with nutrition messages that are realistic, positive, easy to understand, and actionable without an expectation that consumers will surrender foods they love.  © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

AB Nowadays, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is a clinically acceptable (and sometimes preferred) strategy in patients with operable estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Despite the overall effectiveness of endocrine therapy in breast cancer in all settings, de novo (primary) and acquired (secondary) endocrine therapy resistance remains a major clinical problem. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy trials for breast cancer are not only a great opportunity to determine which ER+ breast cancers can be treated without chemotherapy, but also a great strategy to develop insights into the biologic basis for the efficacy of estrogen-receptor-targeting agents, alone or in combination, in an effort to counteract resistance to endocrine therapy and discover actionable molecular targets that can be the focus of future drug discovery efforts and/or translational/clinical investigation in ER+ breast cancers.

AB IMPORTANCE: Understanding molecular mechanisms of response and resistance to anticancer therapies requires prospective patient follow-up and clinical and functional validation of both common and low-frequency mutations. We describe a whole-exome sequencing (WES) precision medicine trial focused on patients with advanced cancer.; OBJECTIVE: To understand how WES data affect therapeutic decision making in patients with advanced cancer and to identify novel biomarkers of response.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients with metastatic and treatment-resistant cancer were prospectively enrolled at a single academic center for paired metastatic tumor and normal tissue WES during a 19-month period (February 2013 through September 2014). A comprehensive computational pipeline was used to detect point mutations, indels, and copy number alterations. Mutations were categorized as category 1, 2, or 3 on the basis of actionability; clinical reports were generated and discussed in precision tumor board. Patients were observed for 7 to 25 months for correlation of molecular information with clinical response.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Feasibility, use of WES for decision making, and identification of novel biomarkers.; RESULTS: A total of 154 tumor-normal pairs from 97 patients with a range of metastatic cancers were sequenced, with a mean coverage of 95X and 16 somatic alterations detected per patient. In total, 16 mutations were category 1 (targeted therapy available), 98 were category 2 (biologically relevant), and 1474 were category 3 (unknown significance). Overall, WES provided informative results in 91 cases (94%), including alterations for which there is an approved drug, there are therapies in clinical or preclinical development, or they are considered drivers and potentially actionable (category 1-2); however, treatment was guided in only 5 patients (5%) on the basis of these recommendations because of access to clinical trials and/or off-label use of drugs. Among unexpected findings, a patient with prostate cancer with exceptional response to treatment was identified who harbored a somatic hemizygous deletion of the DNA repair gene FANCA and putative partial loss of function of the second allele through germline missense variant. Follow-up experiments established that loss of FANCA function was associated with platinum hypersensitivity both in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts, thus providing biologic rationale and functional evidence for his extreme clinical response.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The majority of advanced, treatment-resistant tumors across tumor types harbor biologically informative alterations. The establishment of a clinical trial for WES of metastatic tumors with prospective follow-up of patients can help identify candidate predictive biomarkers of response.

AB By reference to a live hostage negotiation exercise, this study presents a taxonomy of uncertainty that can be usefully applied to assist in the categorization and application of findings from decision-making research conducted in naturalistic (specifically critical incident) settings. Uncertainty was measured via observational methods (during the exercise and by reference to video footage), decision logs, and postincident simulated recall interviews with trainee police officers. Transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically. Uncertainty was dichotomized as deriving from either endogenous sources (about the problem situation itself) or exogenous sources (about the operating system that is dealing with the incident). Overall, exogenous uncertainty (75%) was more prevalent than endogenous uncertainty (25%), specifically during discussions on plan formulation and execution. It was also qualitatively associated with poor role understanding and trust. Endogenous uncertainty was more prevalent during discussions on situation assessment and plan formulation. The taxonomy provides a useful way for organizational researchers to categorize uncertainty during the naturalistic observations of workplace interactions and decision making. It reduces the complexity associated with observational research to allow organizational psychologists to better tailor their recommendations for reducing uncertainty. Dealing with endogenous uncertainties would entail targeting decision making specific to the problem incident (e.g., introduce training or policy to reduce redundant fixation on rote-repetitive superordinate goals and focus on more short-term actionable goals during situation assessments). Dealing with exogenous uncertainties would entail improving decision making relating to management and team processes across critical incidents (e.g., training to clarify distributed roles in critical incident teams to aid plan formulation and execution). Organizational researchers interested in uncertainty management in the workplace should utilize this taxonomy as a guide to (a) categorize uncertainty and (b) generate applicable recommendations from their findings.

AB Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a tumor-suppressive mechanism that is induced by the replicative and metabolic stress of oncogene activation, is a key barrier in the development of BRAF V600E colon cancer. Inhibition of this mechanism has been observed through epigenetic changes observed in sporadic serrated polyps, as well as through the germline mutations associated with those who develop serrated polyposis. We hypothesize that upregulated autocrine factors exist that are specific to the serrated pathway and also promote bypass of oncogene-induced senescence. To identify such autocrine factors, we integrate analyses of microarrays of sessile serrated polyps and two large colon cancer cohorts, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 153), and French national Cartes d'Identite des Tumeurs (CIT) program (n = 462), with enhanced gene annotation through natural language processing techniques of the existing medical corpus. We reproducibly associate higher expression of the ligand-receptor axis of TFF2 and CXCR4 with BRAF V600E-mutant colon cancer (P = 3.0 * 10(-3) and 0.077, respectively for TCGA; P = 3.0 * 10(-8) and 5.1 * 10(-7) for CIT). Given well-described oncogenic roles of TFF2 and CXCR4 in colon cancer, and availability of CXCR4 inhibitors for other clinical indications, this ligand-receptor axis may represent an actionable target for prevention and treatment of this molecular subtype of colorectal cancer. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommended that clinical laboratories performing next-generation sequencing analyze and return pathogenic variants for 56 specific genes it considered medically actionable. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of returning these results.; METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic policy model to project the quality-adjusted life-years and lifetime costs associated with returning ACMG-recommended incidental findings in three hypothetical cohorts of 10,000 patients.; RESULTS: Returning incidental findings to cardiomyopathy patients, colorectal cancer patients, or healthy individuals would increase costs by $896,000, $2.9 million, and $3.9 million, respectively, and would increase quality-adjusted life-years by 20, 25.4, and 67 years, respectively, for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $44,800, $115,020, and $58,600, respectively. In probabilistic analyses, returning incidental findings cost less than $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained in 85, 28, and 91%, respectively, of simulations. Assuming next-generation sequencing costs $500, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for primary screening of healthy individuals was $133,400 (<$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained in 10% of simulations). Results were sensitive to the cohort age and assumptions about gene penetrance.; CONCLUSION: Returning incidental findings is likely cost-effective for certain patient populations. Screening of generally healthy individuals is likely not cost-effective based on current data, unless next-generation sequencing costs less than $500.

AB Desmoplastic malignant melanoma is a distinct melanoma entity histologically subtyped into mixed and pure forms due to significantly reduced lymph node metastases in the pure form. Recent reports investigating common actionable driver mutations have demonstrated a lack of BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutation in pure desmoplastic melanoma. In search for alternative driver mutations next generation amplicon sequencing for hotspot mutations in 50 genes cardinal to tumorigenesis was performed and in addition the RET G691S polymorphism was investigated. Data from 21 desmoplastic melanomas (12 pure and 9 mixed) were retrieved. Pure desmoplastic melanomas were either devoid of mutations (50%) or displayed mutations in tumor suppressor genes (TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4) singularly or in combination with the exception of a PIK3CA double-mutation lacking established biological relevance. Mixed desmoplastic melanomas on the contrary were frequently mutated (89%), and 67% exhibited activating mutations similar to common-type cutaneous malignant melanomas (BRAF, NRAS, FGFR2, and ERBB2). Separate analysis of morphologically heterogeneous tumor areas in four mixed desmoplastic malignant melanomas displayed no difference in mutation status and RET G691 status. GNAQ and GNA11, two oncogenes in BRAF and NRAS wild-type uveal melanomas, were not mutated in our cohort. The RET G691S polymorphism was found in 25% of pure and 38% of mixed desmoplastic melanomas. Apart from RET G691S our findings demonstrate absence of activating driver mutations in pure desmoplastic melanoma beyond previously investigated oncogenes (BRAF, NRAS, and KIT). The findings underline the therapeutic dichotomy of mixed versus pure desmoplastic melanoma with regard to activating mutations primarily of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore women's opinions about the use of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to assess the risk of sex chromosome aneuploidies and microdeletion syndromes.; METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with women who were currently pregnant or had recently delivered. Qualitative analysis using interpretive description was used to generate study findings.; RESULTS: Thirty-one women (mean age 32.4years) participated in the focus groups. Participants were unfamiliar with sex chromosome aneuploidies but expressed support for the use of NIPT to detect these conditions. Participants were uncertain about the utility and actionability of receiving information about microdeletion syndromes with variable or unknown phenotypic expression. Participants voiced their desire to be informed of all conditions assessed by NIPT prior to testing. They considered clinicians to be the key provider of such information, although stated that patients have a responsibility to be knowledgeable prior to testing in order to support informed decision making.; CONCLUSIONS: The use of NIPT to identify sex chromosome aneuploidies and microdeletion syndromes will introduce new challenges for clinicians to ensure pregnant women have the information and resources to make informed choices about NIPT when used for these conditions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Translating relative risk estimates into absolute risks is important in evaluating the potential clinical and public health relevance of etiologic discoveries. Predicting high absolute risk is challenging, particularly for rare endpoints such as pancreatic cancer. Recent efforts to develop risk prediction models for pancreatic cancer have found moderate risk levels for very small parts of the population. A new approach in which clinical symptoms and medication use are evaluated in addition to information on risk factors is presented by Risch et al. in this issue of the Journal (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;182(1):26-34). The authors estimated absolute risks based on the relative risks obtained from their case-control study. Their absolute risk estimates were higher than those from previous approaches but remained restricted to a very small proportion of the general population. In the present commentary, we address issues of absolute risk stratification (particularly for rare diseases), specific analytic methods, and how actionable information will differ based on the disease and possible intervention. We suggest that moving from cancer-specific models to broader models used to predict risk for multiple outcomes can make risk prediction for rare diseases more effective. When considering translational goals, it is important to estimate absolute risk at the early stages of etiologic research. The results can be sobering but allow focusing on the most promising goals.

AB BACKGROUND: HER2 mutations and amplifications have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers. Dacomitinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER2, EGFR (HER1), and HER4 tyrosine kinases, has demonstrated activity in cell-line models with HER2 exon 20 insertions or amplifications. Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity.; RESULTS: We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine.; CONCLUSIONS: Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions. This observation validates HER2 exon 20 insertions as actionable targets and justifies further study of HER2-targeted agents in specific HER2-driven lung cancers.; CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00818441. © The Author 2015.

AB OBJECTIVE: Dispositional optimism and risk perceptions are each associated with health-related behaviors and decisions and other outcomes, but little research has examined how these constructs interact, particularly in consequential health contexts. The predictive validity of risk perceptions for health-related information seeking and intentions may be improved by examining dispositional optimism as a moderator, and by testing alternate types of risk perceptions, such as comparative and experiential risk.; METHOD: Participants (n = 496) had their genomes sequenced as part of a National Institutes of Health pilot cohort study (ClinSeq). Participants completed a cross-sectional baseline survey of various types of risk perceptions and intentions to learn genome sequencing results for differing disease risks (e.g., medically actionable, nonmedically actionable, carrier status) and to use this information to change their lifestyle/health behaviors.; RESULTS: Risk perceptions (absolute, comparative, and experiential) were largely unassociated with intentions to learn sequencing results. Dispositional optimism and comparative risk perceptions interacted, however, such that individuals higher in optimism reported greater intentions to learn all 3 types of sequencing results when comparative risk was perceived to be higher than when it was perceived to be lower. This interaction was inconsistent for experiential risk and absent for absolute risk. Independent of perceived risk, participants high in dispositional optimism reported greater interest in learning risks for nonmedically actionable disease and carrier status, and greater intentions to use genome information to change their lifestyle/health behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between risk perceptions and intentions may depend on how risk perceptions are assessed and on degree of optimism.

AB Overweight and obesity compose a chronic disease process of epidemic proportions that presents on a continuum, likely affecting nearly two out of every three patients treated by physician assistants (PAs). However, meaningful and actionable definitions, including but not limited to anthropometric and clinical descriptors, are needed. The effective treatment of overweight and obesity requires an efficient and timely process of screening, diagnosis, evaluation of complications, staging, and clear algorithmic management. PAs are trained as primary care providers and can diagnose and treat overweight and obese patients regardless of practice setting and across the spectrum of the disease and patient's age.

AB Maternal death is as much a social phenomenon as a medical event. Maternal death review (MDR), a strategy for monitoring maternal deaths, provides information on medical, social and health system factors that should be addressed to redress gaps in service provision or utilisation. To strengthen MDR implementation in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The project involved development of state specific guidelines, technical assistance in operationalization and analysing processes and findings of MDR in ten districts. 284 deaths were recorded over 6 months (April-September 2012) of which 193 (75.4 %) could be reviewed. Post-partum haemorrhage (24 %) and hypertensive disorders (27.4 %) followed by puerperal sepsis in the post-partum period (16.8 %) were the leading causes of maternal deaths. 68.3 % deaths occurred at health facilities. 67 % of mothers dying during the natal or post-natal period, delivered at home, though the death occurred in a health facility. Type 1 delay (58.9 %) was the most common underlying cause of death, followed by type 3 delay (33.3 %). Under or nil reporting from the facilities was observed. Program staff could identify broad areas of intervention but lacked capacity to monitor, analyse, interpret and utilize the generated information to develop feasible actionable plans. Information gathered was incomplete and inaccurate in many cases. Challenges observed showed that it will require more time and continuous committed efforts of health staff for implementation of high quality MDR. Successful implementation will improve the response of the health system and contribute to improved maternal health.

AB To assess factors influencing the success of whole-genome sequencing for mainstream clinical diagnosis, we sequenced 217 individuals from 156 independent cases or families across a broad spectrum of disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. We quantified the number of candidate variants identified using different strategies for variant calling, filtering, annotation and prioritization. We found that jointly calling variants across samples, filtering against both local and external databases, deploying multiple annotation tools and using familial transmission above biological plausibility contributed to accuracy. Overall, we identified disease-causing variants in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to 34% (23/68) for mendelian disorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. We also discovered 32 potentially clinically actionable variants in 18 genes unrelated to the referral disorder, although only 4 were ultimately considered reportable. Our results demonstrate the value of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding challenges.

AB The community-based participatory research (CBPR) literature notes that researchers should share study results with communities. In the case of human genetic research, results may be scientifically interesting but lack clinical relevance. The goals of this study were to learn what kinds of information community members want to receive about genetic research and how such information should be conveyed. We conducted eight focus group discussions with Yup'ik Alaska Native people in southwest Alaska (N=60) and 6 (N=61) with members of a large health maintenance organization in Seattle, Washington. Participants wanted to receive genetic information they "could do something about" and wanted clinically actionable information to be shared with their healthcare providers; they also wanted researchers to share knowledge about other topics of importance to the community. Although Alaska Native participants were generally less familiar with western scientific terms and less interested in web-based information sources, the main findings were the same in Alaska and Seattle: participants wished for ongoing dialogue, including opportunities for informal, small-group conversations, and receiving information that had local relevance. Effective community dissemination is more than a matter of presenting study results in lay language. Community members should be involved in both defining culturally appropriate communication strategies and in determining which information should be shared. Reframing dissemination as a two-way dialogue, rather than a one-way broadcast, supports the twin aims of advancing scientific knowledge and achieving community benefit. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at increased risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition. Outbreaks may be difficult to identify due in part to limitations in current molecular genotyping available in clinical practice. Comparison of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may identify epidemiologically distinct isolates among a population sample that appears homogenous when evaluated using conventional typing methods. OBJECTIVE To investigate a putative MRSA outbreak in a NICU utilizing whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify recent transmission events. DESIGN Clinical and surveillance specimens collected during clinical care and outbreak investigation. PATIENTS A total of 17 neonates hospitalized in a 43-bed level III NICU in northeastern Florida from December 2010 to October 2011 were included in this study. METHODS We assessed epidemiological data in conjunction with 4 typing methods: antibiograms, PFGE, spa types, and phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide SNPs. RESULTS Among the 17 type USA300 isolates, 4 different spa types were identified using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Phylogenetic analysis identified 5 infants as belonging to 2 clusters of epidemiologically linked cases and excluded 10 unlinked cases from putative transmission events. The availability of these results during the initial investigation would have improved infection control interventions. CONCLUSION Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis are invaluable tools for epidemic investigation; they identify transmission events and exclude cases mistakenly implicated by traditional typing methods. When routinely applied to surveillance and investigation in the clinical setting, this approach may provide actionable intelligence for measured, appropriate, and effective interventions.

AB Rapidly improving understanding of molecular oncology, emerging novel therapeutics, and increasingly available and affordable next-generation sequencing have created an opportunity for delivering genomically informed personalized cancer therapy. However, to implement genomically informed therapy requires that a clinician interpret the patient's molecular profile, including molecular characterization of the tumor and the patient's germline DNA. In this Commentary, we review existing data and tools for precision oncology and present a framework for reviewing the available biomedical literature on therapeutic implications of genomic alterations. Genomic alterations, including mutations, insertions/deletions, fusions, and copy number changes, need to be curated in terms of the likelihood that they alter the function of a "cancer gene" at the level of a specific variant in order to discriminate so-called "drivers" from "passengers." Alterations that are targetable either directly or indirectly with approved or investigational therapies are potentially "actionable." At this time, evidence linking predictive biomarkers to therapies is strong for only a few genomic markers in the context of specific cancer types. For these genomic alterations in other diseases and for other genomic alterations, the clinical data are either absent or insufficient to support routine clinical implementation of biomarker-based therapy. However, there is great interest in optimally matching patients to early-phase clinical trials. Thus, we need accessible, comprehensive, and frequently updated knowledge bases that describe genomic changes and their clinical implications, as well as continued education of clinicians and patients. © The Author 2015.

AB BACKGROUND: We sought to profile Atypical Meningioma in a high-throughput manner to better understand the altered signaling within these tumors and specifically the kinases altered in recurrent atypical meningioma. Kinomic Profiles could be used to identify prognostic biomarkers for responders/non-responders to classify future patients that are unlikely to benefit from current therapies. Directly these results could be used to identify drug-actionable kinase targets as well.; METHODS: Peptide-substrate microarray kinase activity analysis was conducted with a PamStation12 analyzing the tyrosine kinome in each tumor kinetically against ~144 target peptides. These data were then analyzed relative to clinical outcome (e.g., tumor recurrence).; RESULTS: 3 major clusters of atypical meningiomas were identified with highly variant peptides primarily being targets of EGFR family, ABL, BRK and BMX kinases. Kinomic analysis of recurrent atypical meningiomas indicated patterns of increased phosphorylation of BMX, TYRO3 and FAK substrates as compared to non-recurrent tumors.; CONCLUSION: The atypical meningiomas profiled here exhibited molecular sub-clustering that may have phenotypic corollaries predictive of outcome. Recurrent tumors had increases in kinase activity that may predict resistance to current therapies, and may guide selection of directed therapies. Taken together these data further the understanding of kinomic alteration in atypical meningioma, and the processes that may not only mediate recurrence, but additionally may identify kinase targets for intervention.

AB OBJECTIVES: We investigated the performance and the clinical impact of histologic examination of infected tissue in patients with suspected invasive fungal infection (IFI) at a tertiary pediatric center.; METHODS: Unique episodes of IFI were identified from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2012. Surgical pathology reports, fungal culture results, and clinical data were abstracted from medical records.; RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with IFI were identified. Each patient had one episode of IFI. Risk factors included chemotherapy for an oncologic condition (n = 35), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n = 6), solid organ transplantation (n = 4), and primary immunodeficiency (n = 2). Tissue was obtained from deep subcutaneous tissue (n = 21), visceral organs (14 lungs, five livers, and one spleen), or the sinonasal cavity (n = 6). Fungal culture was ordered in 40 of the 47 episodes of IFI. Fungus grew in 27 (68%) of the 40 cultures submitted, and all isolates were concordant with histology. Medical records were available for 36 (77%) of 47 patients. Communication of histology results prompted changes in antifungal therapy 64% of the time. This included initiation of antifungal therapy in 13 patients who were not previously receiving therapy. Fifteen (42%) patients underwent surgical excision within 48 hours of histologic diagnosis.; CONCLUSIONS: Histology can provide rapid, accurate, and clinically actionable information to clinicians caring for children with IFI.

AB Innovation leading to significant advances in research and subsequent translation to clinical practice is urgently necessary in early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer. Addressing this need, the Early Detection of Sporadic Pancreatic Cancer Summit Conference was conducted by Kenner Family Research Fund in conjunction with the 2014 American Pancreatic Association and Japan Pancreas Society Meeting. International interdisciplinary scientific representatives engaged in strategic facilitated conversations based on distinct areas of inquiry: Case for Early Detection: Definitions, Detection, Survival, and Challenges; Biomarkers for Early Detection; Imaging; and Collaborative Studies. Ideas generated from the summit have led to the development of a Strategic Map for Innovation built upon 3 components: formation of an international collaborative effort, design of an actionable strategic plan, and implementation of operational standards, research priorities, and first-phase initiatives. Through invested and committed efforts of leading researchers and institutions, philanthropic partners, government agencies, and supportive business entities, this endeavor will change the future of the field and consequently the survival rate of those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

AB Approximately 50% of conventional inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) harbor ALK gene rearrangement and overexpress ALK. Recently, gene fusions involving other kinases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IMT, including ROS1 and in 1 patient PDGFRB. However, it remains uncertain whether the emerging genotypes correlate with clinicopathologic characteristics of IMT. In this study, we expand the molecular investigation of IMT in a large cohort of different clinical presentations and analyze for potential genotype-phenotype associations. Criteria for inclusion in the study were typical morphology and tissue availability for molecular studies. The lack of ALK immunoreactivity was not an excluding factor. As overlapping gene fusions involving actionable kinases are emerging in both IMT and lung cancer, we set out to evaluate abnormalities in ALK, ROS1, PDGFRB, NTRK1, and RET by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition, next-generation paired-end RNA sequencing and FusionSeq algorithm was applied in 4 cases, which identified EML4-ALK fusions in 2 cases. Of the 62 IMTs (25 children and 37 adults), 35 (56%) showed ALK gene rearrangement. Of note, EML4-ALK inversion was noted in 7 (20%) cases, seen mainly in the lung and soft tissue of young children including 2 lesions from newborns. There were 6 (10%) ROS1-rearranged IMTs, all except 1 presenting in children, mainly in the lung and intra-abdominally and showed a distinctive fascicular growth of spindle cells with long cell processes, often positive for ROS1 immunohistochemistry. Two of the cases showed TFG-ROS1 fusions. Interestingly, 1 adult IMT revealed a RET gene rearrangement, a previously unreported finding. Our results show that 42/62 (68%) IMTs are characterized by kinase fusions, offering a rationale for targeted therapeutic strategies. Interestingly, 90% of fusion-negative IMTs were seen in adults, whereas >90% of pediatric IMT showed gene rearrangements. EML4-ALK inversion and ROS1 fusions emerge as common fusion abnormalities in IMT, closely recapitulating the pattern seen in lung cancer.

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) harbors an exceedingly poor prognosis, and is generally considered a therapy-recalcitrant disease due to poor response to conventional chemotherapy coupled with non-actionable genetic drivers (e.g. KRAS mutations). However, PDA frequently loses p16ink4a, thereby leading to deregulation of CDK4/6. Surprisingly, in established cell models and xenografts, CDK4/6 inhibition has a modest effect on proliferation and resistance develops rapidly. To determine if such weak response was an intrinsic feature of PDA, we developed primary tumor explants that maintain the tumor environment and recapitulate feuture of primary PDA. The CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 was highly efficient at suppressing proliferation in 14 of the 15 explants. In the single resistant explant, we identified the rare loss of the RB tumor suppressor as the basis for resistance. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were developed in parallel, and unlike the xenografts emerging from established cell lines, the PDXs maintained the histoarchitecture of the primary tumor. These PDXs were highly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition, yielding a complete suppression of PDA proliferation. Together, these data indicate that primary PDA is sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition, that specific biomarkers can delineate intrinsic resistance, and that established cell line models may not represent an adequate means for evaluating therapeutic sensitivities.

AB Although somatically acquired genomic alterations have long been recognized as the hallmarks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the last decade has shown that inherited genetic variations (germline) are important determinants of interpatient variability in ALL susceptibility, drug response, and toxicities of ALL therapy. In particular, unbiased genome-wide association studies have identified germline variants strongly associated with the predisposition to ALL in children, providing novel insight into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis and evidence for complex interactions between inherited and acquired genetic variations in ALL. Similar genome-wide approaches have also discovered novel germline genetic risk factors that independently influence ALL prognosis and those that strongly modify host susceptibility to adverse effects of antileukemic agents (eg, vincristine, asparaginase, glucocorticoids). There are examples of germline genomic associations that warrant routine clinical use in the treatment of childhood ALL (eg, TPMT and mercaptopurine dosing), but most have not reached this level of actionability. Future studies are needed to integrate both somatic and germline variants to predict risk of relapse and host toxicities, with the eventual goal of implementing genetics-driven precision-medicine approaches in ALL treatment.  © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) encompasses a group of related but distinct malignancies whose lack of a stereotyped genetic signature makes challenging the identification of genomic landscape and the development of effective targeted therapies. Accumulated evidences strongly suggest that the remarkable genetic heterogeneity of CC may be the result of a complex interplay among different causative factors, some shared by most human cancers while others typical of this malignancy. Currently, considerable efforts are ongoing worldwide for the genetic characterization of CC, also using advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). Undoubtedly this technology could offer an unique opportunity to broaden our understanding on CC molecular pathogenesis. Despite this great potential, however, the high complexity in terms of factors potentially contributing to genetic variability in CC calls for a more cautionary application of NGS to this malignancy, in order to avoid possible biases and criticisms in the identification of candidate actionable targets. This approach is further justified by the urgent need to develop effective targeted therapies in this disease. A multidisciplinary approach integrating genomic, functional and clinical studies is therefore mandatory to translate the results obtained by NGS into effective targeted therapies for this orphan disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Several studies show that the regulatory impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) is an essential contribution to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression levels of diverse miRNAs are associated with specific clinical diagnoses and prognoses of CRC. However, this association reveals very little actionable information with regard to how or whether to treat a CRC patient. To address this problem, we use miRNA expression data along with other molecular information to predict individual response of CRC cell lines and CRC patients.; METHODS: A strategy has been developed to join four types of information: molecular, kinetic, genetic and treatment data for prediction of individual treatment response of CRC.; RESULTS: Information on miRNA regulation, including miRNA target regulation and transcriptional regulation of miRNA, in integrated into an in silico molecular model for colon cancer. This molecular model is applied to study responses of seven CRC cell lines from NCI-60 to ten agents targeting signaling pathways. Predictive results of models without and with implemented miRNA information are compared and advantages are shown for the extended model. Finally, the extended model was applied to the data of 22 CRC patients to predict response to treatments of sirolimus and LY294002. The in silico results can also replicate the oncogenic and tumor suppression roles of miRNA on the therapeutic response as reported in the literature.; CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results reveal that detailed molecular events can be combined with individual genetic data, including gene/miRNA expression data, to enhance in silico prediction of therapeutic response of individual CRC tumors. The study demonstrates that miRNA information can be applied as actionable information regarding individual therapeutic response.

AB MOTIVATION: The conventional approach to personalized medicine relies on molecular data analytics across multiple patients. The path to precision medicine lies with molecular data analytics that can discover interpretable single-subject signals (N-of-1). We developed a global framework, N-of-1-pathways, for a mechanistic-anchored approach to single-subject gene expression data analysis. We previously employed a metric that could prioritize the statistical significance of a deregulated pathway in single subjects, however, it lacked in quantitative interpretability (e.g. the equivalent to a gene expression fold-change).; RESULTS: In this study, we extend our previous approach with the application of statistical Mahalanobis distance (MD) to quantify personal pathway-level deregulation. We demonstrate that this approach, N-of-1-pathways Paired Samples MD (N-OF-1-PATHWAYS-MD), detects deregulated pathways (empirical simulations), while not inflating false-positive rate using a study with biological replicates. Finally, we establish that N-OF-1-PATHWAYS-MD scores are, biologically significant, clinically relevant and are predictive of breast cancer survival (P < 0.05, n = 80 invasive carcinoma; TCGA RNA-sequences).; CONCLUSION: N-of-1-pathways MD provides a practical approach towards precision medicine. The method generates the magnitude and the biological significance of personal deregulated pathways results derived solely from the patient's transcriptome. These pathways offer the opportunities for deriving clinically actionable decisions that have the potential to complement the clinical interpretability of personal polymorphisms obtained from DNA acquired or inherited polymorphisms and mutations. In addition, it offers an opportunity for applicability to diseases in which DNA changes may not be relevant, and thus expand the 'interpretable 'omics' of single subjects (e.g. personalome).; AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.lussierlab.net/publications/N-of-1-pathways. © The Author 2015.

AB Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become an important therapeutic option for treating several forms of cancer. Gefitinib, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is in clinical use for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, despite high initial response rates, many patients develop resistance to gefitinib. The molecular mechanisms of TKI resistance often remain unclear. Here, we describe a chemical proteomic approach comprising kinase affinity purification (kinobeads) and quantitative mass spectrometry for the identification of kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms in cancer cells. We identified the previously described amplification of MET and found EPHA2 to be more than 10-fold overexpressed (p < 0.001) in gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells suggesting a potential role in developing resistance. siRNA-mediated EPHA2 knock-down or treating cells with the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib restored sensitivity to gefitinib. Of all dasatinib targets, EPHA2 exhibited the most drastic effect (p < 0.001). In addition, EPHA2 knockdown or ephrin-A1 treatment of resistant cells decreased FAK phosphorylation and cell migration. These findings confirm EPHA2 as an actionable drug target, provide a rational basis for drug combination approaches, and indicate that chemical proteomics is broadly applicable for the discovery of kinase inhibitor resistance.

AB The development of novel effective immunotherapeutic agents and early clinical data hinting at significant activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has introduced yet another player in the field of management of advanced disease. At present, first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally withheld pending results of molecular testing for any actionable genetic alteration that could lead to targeted treatment, and in their absence chemotherapy is prescribed as a default therapy. Phase III trials comparing head-to-head immune checkpoint inhibitors with standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy are underway. Second-line chemotherapy is likewise being challenged in phase III trials, one of which having recently reported positive results in advanced squamous cell carcinoma. In tumors harboring actionable transforming genetic alterations such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements, second- and third-generation inhibitors allow for multiple lines of targeted treatment beyond initial resistance, postponing the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy to very late lines of therapy. Chemotherapy as a longstanding but still present standard of care capable of prolonging survival, improving quality of life, and relieving symptoms sees its role increasingly restricted to clinical, immunological, and molecular subsets of patients where its activity and efficacy have never been tested prospectively.

AB BACKGROUND: Peer feedback is increasingly being used by residency programs to provide an added dimension to the assessment process. Studies show that peer feedback is useful, uniquely informative, and reliable compared to other types of assessments. Potential barriers to implementation include insufficient training/preparation, negative consequences for working relationships, and a perceived lack of benefit.; OBJECTIVE: We explored the perceptions of residents involved in peer-to-peer feedback, focusing on factors that influence accuracy, usefulness, and application of the information.; METHODS: Family medicine residents at the University of Michigan who were piloting an online peer assessment tool completed a brief survey to offer researchers insight into the peer feedback process. Focus groups were conducted to explore residents' perceptions that are most likely to affect giving and receiving peer feedback.; RESULTS: Survey responses were provided by 28 of 30 residents (93%). Responses showed that peer feedback provided useful (89%, 25 of 28) and unique (89%, 24 of 27) information, yet only 59% (16 of 27) reported that it benefited their training. Focus group participants included 21 of 29 eligible residents (72%). Approaches to improve residents' ability to give and accept feedback included preparatory training, clearly defined goals, standardization, fewer and more qualitatively oriented encounters, 1-on-1 delivery, immediacy of timing, and cultivation of a feedback culture.; CONCLUSIONS: Residents perceived feedback as important and offered actionable suggestions to enhance accuracy, usefulness, and application of the information shared. The findings can be used to inform residency programs that are interested in creating a meaningful peer feedback process.

AB BACKGROUND: In contrast to historical feedback, which was vague or provided residents' numerical scores without clear meaning, milestone-based feedback is focused on specific knowledge, skills, and behaviors that define developmental trajectory. It was anticipated that residents would welcome the more specific and actionable feedback provided by the milestone framework, but this has not been studied.; OBJECTIVE: We assessed internal medicine (IM) residents' perceptions of receiving feedback in the milestone framework, particularly assessing perception of the utility of milestone-based feedback compared to non-milestone-based feedback.; METHODS: We surveyed a total of 510 IM residents from 7 institutions. Survey questions assessed resident perception of milestone feedback in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and trajectory of professional development. Postgraduate years 2 and 3 (PGY-2 and PGY-3) residents were asked to compare milestones with prior methods of feedback.; RESULTS: Of 510 residents, 356 (69.8%) responded. Slightly less than half of the residents found milestone-based feedback "extremely useful" or "very useful" in identifying strengths (44%), weaknesses (43%), specific areas for improvement (45%), and appropriate education progress (48%). Few residents found such feedback "not very useful" or "not at all useful" in these domains. A total of 51% of PGY-2 and PGY-3 residents agreed that receiving milestone-based feedback was more helpful than previous forms of feedback.; CONCLUSIONS: IM residents are aware of the concepts of milestones, and half of the residents surveyed found milestone feedback more helpful than previous forms of feedback. More work needs to be done to understand how milestone-based feedback could be delivered more effectively to enhance resident development.

AB Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging is an emerging microscopy modality for clinical histopathologic diagnoses as well as for biomedical research. Spectral data recorded in this modality are indicative of the underlying, spatially resolved biochemical composition but need computerized algorithms to digitally recognize and transform this information to a diagnostic tool to identify cancer or other physiologic conditions. Statistical pattern recognition forms the backbone of these recognition protocols and can be used for highly accurate results. Aided by biochemical correlations with normal and diseased states and the power of modern computer-aided pattern recognition, this approach is capable of combating many standing questions of traditional histology-based diagnosis models. For example, a simple diagnostic test can be developed to determine cell types in tissue. As a more advanced application, IR spectral data can be integrated with patient information to predict risk of cancer, providing a potential road to precision medicine and personalized care in cancer treatment. The IR imaging approach can be implemented to complement conventional diagnoses, as the samples remain unperturbed and are not destroyed. Despite high potential and utility of this approach, clinical implementation has not yet been achieved due to practical hurdles like speed of data acquisition and lack of optimized computational procedures for extracting clinically actionable information rapidly. The latter problem has been addressed by developing highly efficient ways to process IR imaging data but remains one that has considerable scope for progress. Here, we summarize the major issues and provide practical considerations in implementing a modified Bayesian classification protocol for digital molecular pathology. We hope to familiarize readers with analysis methods in IR imaging data and enable researchers to develop methods that can lead to the use of this promising technique for digital diagnosis of cancer.

AB A major challenge facing the community involves identification of mutations that drive cancer. Analyses of cancer genomes to detect, and distinguish, 'driver' from 'passenger' mutations are daunting tasks. Here we suggest that there is a third 'latent driver' category. 'Latent driver' mutations behave as passengers, and do not confer a cancer hallmark. However, coupled with other emerging mutations, they drive cancer development and drug resistance. 'Latent drivers' emerge prior to and during cancer evolution. These allosteric mutations can work through 'AND' all-or-none or incremental 'Graded' logic gate mechanisms. Current diagnostic platforms generally assume that actionable 'driver' mutations are those appearing most frequently in cancer. We propose that 'latent driver' detection may help forecast cancer progression and modify personalized drug regimes.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB CONTEXT: Maryland recently passed legislation mandating that hospitals with more than 50 beds have palliative care (PC) programs. Although the state's health agency can play a key role in ensuring successful implementation of this measure, there is little actionable information from which it can guide resource allocation for enhancing PC delivery statewide.; OBJECTIVES: To assess the PC infrastructure at Maryland's 46 community-based nonspecialty hospitals and to describe providers' perspectives on barriers to PC and supports that could enhance PC delivery.; METHODS: Data on PC programs were collected using two mechanisms. First, a survey was sent to all 46 community-based hospital chief executive officers by the Maryland Cancer Collaborative. The Maryland Health Care Commission provided supplementary survey and semistructured interview data.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight hospitals (60.9%) provided information on their PC services. Eighty-nine percent of these hospitals reported the presence of a structured PC program. The profile of services provided by PC programs was largely conserved across hospital geography and size. The most common barriers reported to PC delivery were lack of knowledge among patients and/or families and lack of physician buy-in; most hospitals reported that networks and/or conferences to promote best practice sharing in PC would be useful supports.; CONCLUSION: Systematic collection of state-level PC infrastructure data can be used to guide state health agencies' understanding of extant resources and challenges, using those data to determine resource allocation to promote the timely receipt of PC for patients and families.

AB INTRODUCTION: Merkel cell carcinoma is a neuroendocrine malignancy. Suppressor of fused (SUFU) is a tumor suppressor oncogene that participates in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The aim of the study was to describe a patient whose Merkel cell carcinoma demonstrated a SUFU genomic alteration.; CASE STUDY: The Hh signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of several tumors, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome that is associated with an alteration of the patched-1 (PTCH1) gene. Targeted molecular therapy against smoothened (SMO) with vismodegib has been shown to be an effective therapeutic intervention for patients with PTCH-1 mutation. The reported patient was presented with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. Analysis of his tumor, using a next-generation sequencing-based assay, demonstrated a genomic aberration of SUFU protein, a component of the Hh signaling pathway that acts downstream to SMO and, therefore, is unlikely to be responsive to vismodegib. Of interest, arsenic trioxide or bromo and extra C-terminal inhibitors impact signals downstream to SUFU, making this aberration conceivably druggable. His tumor has initially been managed with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) and subsequent radiation therapy is planned.; CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma is multifactorial, and related to ultraviolet radiation exposure, immunosuppression, and Merkel cell polyomavirus. We report a patient with a mutation in SUFU, a potentially actionable component of the Hh signaling pathway.

AB UNLABELLED: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is activated through multiple mechanisms in colorectal carcinoma. Here, the clinicopathologic and molecular features of AKT1 E17K-mutated colorectal carcinoma in comparison with PIK3CA-mutated colorectal carcinoma are described in detail. Interestingly, in comparison with PIK3CA mutants, AKT1 E17K was significantly associated with mucinous morphology and concurrent BRAF V600E mutation. Among PIK3CA mutants, exon 21 mutations were significantly associated with BRAF V600E mutation, MSI-H status, and poor differentiation, while exon 10 mutations were associated with KRAS/NRAS mutations. Three of four AKT1 mutants with data from both primary and metastatic lesions had concordant AKT1 mutation status in both. Both AKT1- and PIK3CA-mutant colorectal carcinoma demonstrated frequent loss of PTEN expression (38% and 34%, respectively) and similar rates of p-PRAS 40 expression (63% and 50%, respectively). Both patients with AKT1 E17K alone had primary resistance to cetuximab, whereas 7 of 8 patients with PIK3CA mutation alone experienced tumor shrinkage or stability with anti-EGFR therapy. These results demonstrate that AKT1 E17K mutation in advanced colorectal carcinoma is associated with mucinous morphology, PIK3CA wild-type status, and concurrent RAS/RAF mutations with similar pattern to PIK3CA exon 21 mutants. Thus, AKT1 E17K mutations contribute to primary resistance to cetuximab and serve as an actionable alteration.; IMPLICATIONS: This first systematic study of AKT1 and PIK3CA hotspot mutations and their association with cetuximab resistance and BRAF V600E mutation has important ramifications for the development of personalized medicine, particularly in identifying patient candidates for PI3K or AKT inhibitors. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB This article provides a model for understanding the role positive body image can play in the treatment of eating disorders and methods for guiding patients away from symptoms and toward flourishing. The Attuned Representational Model of Self (Cook-Cottone, 2006) and a conceptual model detailing flourishing in the context of body image and eating behavior (Cook-Cottone et al., 2013) are discussed. The flourishing inherent in positive body image comes hand-in-hand with two critical ways of being: (a) having healthy, embodied awareness of the internal and external aspects of self (i.e., attunement) and (b) engaging in mindful self-care. Attunement and mindful self-care thus are considered as potential targets of actionable therapeutic work in the cultivation of positive body image among those with disordered eating. For context, best-practices in eating disorder treatment are also reviewed. Limitations in current research are detailed and directions for future research are explicated.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow for the generation of whole exome or whole genome sequencing data, which can be used to identify novel genetic alterations associated with defined phenotypes or to expedite discovery of functional variants for improved patient care. Because this robust technology has the ability to identify all mutations within a genome, incidental findings (IF)- genetic alterations associated with conditions or diseases unrelated to the patient's present condition for which current tests are being performed- may have important clinical ramifications. The current debate among genetic scientists and clinicians focuses on the following questions: 1) should any IF be disclosed to patients, and 2) which IF should be disclosed - actionable mutations, variants of unknown significance, or all IF? Policies for disclosure of IF are being developed for when and how to convey these findings and whether adults, minors, or individuals unable to provide consent have the right to refuse receipt of IF. In this review, we detail current NGS technology platforms, discuss pressing issues regarding disclosure of IF, and how IF are currently being handled in prenatal, pediatric, and adult patients.

AB To facilitate personalized drug dosing (PDD), this pilot study explored the communication effectiveness and clinical impact of using a prototype clinical decision support (CDS) system embedded in an electronic health record (EHR) to deliver pharmacogenomic (PGx) information to physicians. We employed a conceptual framework and measurement model to access the impact of physician characteristics (previous experience, awareness, relative advantage, perceived usefulness), technology characteristics (methods of implementation-semi-active/active, actionability-low/high) and a task characteristic (drug prescribed) on communication effectiveness (usefulness, confidence in prescribing decision), and clinical impact (uptake, prescribing intent, change in drug dosing). Physicians performed prescribing tasks using five simulated clinical case scenarios, presented in random order within the prototype PGx-CDS system. Twenty-two physicians completed the study. The proportion of physicians that saw a relative advantage to using PGx-CDS was 83% at the start and 94% at the conclusion of our study. Physicians used semi-active alerts 74-88% of the time. There was no association between previous experience with, awareness of, and belief in a relative advantage of using PGx-CDS and improved uptake. The proportion of physicians reporting confidence in their prescribing decisions decreased significantly after using the prototype PGx-CDS system (p=0.02). Despite decreases in confidence, physicians perceived a relative advantage to using PGx-CDS, viewed semi-active alerts on most occasions, and more frequently changed doses toward doses supported by published evidence. Specifically, sixty-five percent of physicians reduced their dosing, significantly for capecitabine (p=0.002) and mercaptopurine/thioguanine (p=0.03). These findings suggest a need to improve our prototype such that PGx CDS content is more useful and delivered in a way that improves physician's confidence in their prescribing decisions. The greatest increases in communication effectiveness and clinical impact of PGx-CDS are likely to be realized through continued focus on content, content delivery, and tailoring to physician characteristics.

In a high-risk urban community, the prevalence of children classified as lead exposed increased ninefold, from 1% to 9.1% (p < .0001) with the new reference level. This dramatic increase in the prevalence of children newly classified as lead exposed will require additional health care and public health resources for tracking, surveillance, and home lead abatement.

AB CONTEXT: Although the value of pharmacogenomics to improve patient outcomes has become increasingly clear, adoption in medical practice has been slow, which can be attributed to several factors, including complicated and expensive testing procedures and required equipment, lack of training by private practice physicians, and reluctance of both private and commercial payers to reimburse for such testing.; OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a fully automated molecular detection system for human genotyping assays, starting with anticoagulated whole blood samples, and to perform all sample preparation, assay, and analysis steps automatically with actionable results reported by the system's software.; DESIGN: The genotypes of 254 random individuals were determined by performing bidirectional DNA sequencing, and that information was used to statistically train the imaging software of the automated molecular detection system to distinguish the 3 possible genotypes (ie, homozygous wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant) at each of 3 different loci (CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1).; RESULTS: The resulting software algorithm was able to correctly identify the genotypes of all 254 individuals (100%) evaluated without any further user analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: The EncompassMDx workstation (Rheonix, Inc, Ithaca, New York) is a molecular detection system that can automatically determine the genotypes of individuals in an unattended manner. Considerably less technical expertise was required to achieve results identical to those obtained using more complex, time-consuming, and expensive bidirectional DNA sequencing. This optimized system may dramatically simplify and reduce the costs of pharmacogenomics testing, thus leading to more-widespread use.

AB BACKGROUND: Alarm fatigue is reported to be a major threat to patient safety, yet little empirical data support its existence in the hospital.; OBJECTIVE: To determine if nurses exposed to high rates of nonactionable physiologic monitor alarms respond more slowly to subsequent alarms that could represent life-threatening conditions.; DESIGN: Observational study using video.; SETTING: Freestanding children's hospital.; PATIENTS: Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients requiring inotropic support and/or mechanical ventilation, and medical ward patients.; INTERVENTION: None.; MEASUREMENTS: Actionable alarms were defined as correctly identifying physiologic status and warranting clinical intervention or consultation. We measured response time to alarms occurring while there were no clinicians in the patient's room. We evaluated the association between the number of nonactionable alarms the patient had in the preceding 120 minutes (categorized as 0-29, 30-79, or 80+ alarms) and response time to subsequent alarms in the same patient using a log-rank test that accounts for within-nurse clustering.; RESULTS: We observed 36 nurses for 210 hours with 5070 alarms; 87.1% of PICU and 99.0% of ward clinical alarms were nonactionable. Kaplan-Meier plots showed incremental increases in response time as the number of nonactionable alarms in the preceding 120 minutes increased (log-rank test stratified by nurse P<0.001 in PICU, P=0.009 in the ward).; CONCLUSIONS: Most alarms were nonactionable, and response time increased as nonactionable alarm exposure increased. Alarm fatigue could explain these findings. Future studies should evaluate the simultaneous influence of workload and other factors that can impact response time. © 2015 Society of Hospital Medicine.

AB OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively assess the pharmacogenomic evidence of routinely used drugs for clinical utility.; METHODS: Between January 2, 2011, and May 31, 2013, we assessed 71 drugs by identifying all drug/genetic variant combinations with published clinical pharmacogenomic evidence. Literature supporting each drug/variant pair was assessed for study design and methods, outcomes, statistical significance, and clinical relevance. Proposed clinical summaries were formally scored using a modified AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) II instrument, including recommendation for or against guideline implementation.; RESULTS: Positive pharmacogenomic findings were identified for 51 of 71 cardiovascular drugs (71.8%), representing 884 unique drug/variant pairs from 597 publications. After analysis for quality and clinical relevance, 92 drug/variant pairs were proposed for translation into clinical summaries, encompassing 23 drugs (32.4% of drugs reviewed). All were recommended for clinical implementation using AGREE II, with mean ± SD overall quality scores of 5.18±0.91 (of 7.0; range, 3.67-7.0). Drug guidelines had highest mean ± SD scores in AGREE II domain 1 (Scope) (91.9±6.1 of 100) and moderate but still robust mean ± SD scores in domain 3 (Rigor) (73.1±11.1), domain 4 (Clarity) (67.8±12.5), and domain 5 (Applicability) (65.8±10.0). Clopidogrel (CYP2C19), metoprolol (CYP2D6), simvastatin (rs4149056), dabigatran (rs2244613), hydralazine (rs1799983, rs1799998), and warfarin (CYP2C9/VKORC1) were distinguished by the highest scores. Seven of the 9 most commonly prescribed drugs warranted translation guidelines summarizing clinical pharmacogenomic information.; CONCLUSION: Considerable clinically actionable pharmacogenomic information for cardiovascular drugs exists, supporting the idea that consideration of such information when prescribing is warranted.

AB Despite the increased use of molecular diagnostics, the extent to which patients who have these tests harbor potentially actionable aberrations is unclear. We retrospectively reviewed 439 patients with diverse cancers, for whom next-generation sequencing (mostly 236-gene panel) had been performed. Data pertaining to the molecular alterations identified, as well as associated treatment suggestions (on- or off-label, or experimental), were extracted from molecular diagnostic reports. Most patients (420/439; 96%) had at least one molecular alteration: 1,813 alterations (in 207 distinct genes) were identified [the majority being mutations (62%) or amplifications (29%)]. The three most common gene abnormalities were TP53 (44%), KRAS (16%), and PIK3CA (12%). The median number of alterations per patient was 3 (range, 0-16). Nineteen patients (4%) had no alterations; 48 patients (11%) had only one alteration; and 372 patients had two or more abnormalities (85%). The median number of potentially actionable anomalies per patient was 2 (range, 0-8). Most patients (393/439; 90%) had at least one potentially actionable alteration, and in all these cases the aberration could at least be targeted by an experimental drug in a clinical trial. A total of 307 patients (70%) had an alteration that was actionable with an approved drug, but in only 89 patients (20%) was the drug approved for their disease (on-label). Next-generation sequencing identified theoretically actionable aberrations in 90% of our patients. Many of the drugs are, however, experimental or would require off-label use. Strategies to address drug access for patients harboring potentially actionable mutations are needed. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Officers and other representatives of more than a dozen food-, nutrition-, and health-related scientific societies and organizations, food industry scientists, and staff of the USDA, the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and the NIH convened on 8 December 2014 in Washington, DC, to reach a consensus among individuals participating on guiding principles for the development of research-oriented, food- and nutrition-related public-private partnerships. During the daylong working meeting, participants discussed and revised 12 previously published guidelines to ensure integrity in the conduct of food and nutrition research collaborations among public, nonprofit, and private sectors. They agreed to reconvene periodically to reassess the public-private partnership principles. This article presents the guiding principles and potential benefits, outlines key discussion points, and articulates points of agreement and reservation.  © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

AB Treatment of older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is challenging in part due to the difficulty of accurately predicting risks and benefits of available therapies. While older patients represent the majority of those with newly diagnosed disease, there remains no consensus regarding optimal therapy. Older age is associated with increased risk of treatment-related toxicity and worse survival compared to younger adults. Age-related outcome disparity in the setting of AML therapy is clearly attributed in part to differences in tumor biology conferring resistance to therapy. However, physiologic changes of aging that decrease treatment tolerance also influence outcomes and vary among patients of the same chronologic age. Measurable patient characteristics such as comorbidity and physical function can reflect the heterogeneity of physiologic aging among older patients and help predict resilience during and after the stress of diagnosis and treatment. To improve outcomes for older adults with AML, it will be critical to investigate the predictive utility of patient characteristics in parallel with tumor biology to improve decision-making, inform trial design, and identify actionable targets for supportive care interventions. This review will focus on available data addressing risk assessment for older adults treated for AML with a focus on patient characteristics that may reflect vulnerability to poor treatment tolerance.

AB This study aimed to investigate whether molecular analysis can be used to refine risk assessment, direct adjuvant therapy, and identify actionable alterations in high-risk endometrial cancer. TransPORTEC, an international consortium related to the PORTEC3 trial, was established for translational research in high-risk endometrial cancer. In this explorative study, routine molecular analyses were used to detect prognostic subgroups: p53 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability and POLE proofreading mutation. Furthermore, DNA was analyzed for hotspot mutations in 13 additional genes (BRAF, CDKNA2, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FOXL2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and PTEN) and protein expression of ER, PR, PTEN, and ARID1a was analyzed. Rates of distant metastasis, recurrence-free, and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. In total, samples of 116 high-risk endometrial cancer patients were included: 86 endometrioid; 12 serous; and 18 clear cell. For endometrioid, serous, and clear cell cancers, 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 68%, 27%, and 50% (P=0.014) and distant metastasis rates 23%, 64%, and 50% (P=0.001), respectively. Four prognostic subgroups were identified: (1) a group of p53-mutant tumors; (2) microsatellite instable tumors; (3) POLE proofreading-mutant tumors; and (4) a group with no specific molecular profile (NSMP). In group 3 (POLE-mutant; n=14) and group 2 (microsatellite instable; n=19) patients, no distant metastasis occurred, compared with 50% distant metastasis rate in group 1 (p53-mutant; n=36) and 39% in group 4 (NSMP; P<0.001). Five-year recurrence-free survival was 93% and 95% for group 3 (POLE-mutant) and group 2 (microsatellite instable) vs 42% (group 1, p53-mutant) and 52% (group 4, NSMP; P<0.001). Targetable FBXW7 and FGFR2 mutations (6%), alterations in the PI3K-AKT pathway (60%) and hormone receptor positivity (45%) were frequently found. In conclusion, molecular analysis of high-risk endometrial cancer identifies four distinct prognostic subgroups, with potential therapeutic implications. High frequencies of targetable alterations were identified and may serve as targets for individualized treatment.

AB Electronic health record (EHR) usage is accelerating while preventable diagnostic error persists. EHRs may even contribute to diagnostic error through several pathways including poor usability and an over reliance on electronic chart based communication. The changing context of healthcare delivery offers potential financial incentives for organizations to leverage EHRs to reduce diagnostic error. The lack of standard quality metrics for reporting rates of diagnostic error, a lack of diagnostic feedback systems for physicians and organizations, and a lack of compelling evidence for specific interventions underscore the need for further research in preventing diagnostic error. Many potential strategies exist for EHRs to reduce the likelihood of diagnostic error. Practical next steps for leveraging EHR systems to assist in the diagnostic process are suggested. These include patient engagement strategies, closed loop result tracking, targeted next step reminder systems, and expansion of a list of actionable patient states based on diagnosis triggers.

AB The ability to collect millions of molecular measurements from patients is a now a reality for clinical medicine. This reality has created the challenge of how to integrate these vast amounts of data into models that accurately predict complex pathophysiology and can translate this complexity into clinically actionable outputs. Integrative informatics and data-driven approaches provide a framework for analyzing large-scale datasets and combining them into multiscale models that can be used to determine the key drivers of disease and identify optimal therapies for treating tumors. In this perspective we discuss how an integrative modeling approach is being used to inform individual treatment decisions, highlighting a recent case report that illustrates the challenges and opportunities for personalized oncology.

AB BACKGROUND: Audit and feedback is integral to performance improvement and behaviour change in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, there remain large gaps in our understanding of the social experience of audit and feedback and the mechanisms whereby it can be optimised as a quality improvement strategy in the ICU setting.; METHODS: We conducted a modified grounded theory qualitative study. Seventy-two clinicians from five academic and five community ICUs in Ontario, Canada, were interviewed. Team members reviewed interview transcripts independently. Data analysis used constant comparative methods.; RESULTS: Clinicians interviewed experienced audit and feedback as fragmented and variable in its effectiveness. Moreover, clinicians felt disconnected from the process. The audit process was perceived as being insufficiently transparent. Feedback was often untimely, incomplete and not actionable. Specific groups such as respiratory therapists and night-shift clinicians felt marginalised. Suggestions for improvement included improving information sharing about the rationale for change and the audit process, tools and metrics; implementing peer-to-peer quality discussions to avoid a top-down approach (eg, incorporating feedback into discussions at daily rounds); providing effective feedback which contains specific, transparent and actionable information; delivering timely feedback (ie, balancing feedback proximate to events with trends over time) and increasing engagement by senior management.; CONCLUSIONS: ICU clinicians experience audit and feedback as fragmented communication with feedback being especially problematic. Attention to improving communication, integration of the process into daily clinical activities and making feedback timely, specific and actionable may increase the effectiveness of audit and feedback to affect desired change.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: The initial developmental standards for Maintenance of Certification programs proposed by the American Board of Medical Specialties included the administration of patient and peer surveys by the diplomate every 5 years. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology Program (MOCA) patient and peer surveys in a selected group of American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) diplomates.; DESIGN: The design was a pilot test of survey instruments-MOCA Patient Care Survey and MOCA Peer Survey.; SETTING: The setting was the ABA, Raleigh, NC.; SUBJECTS: The subjects were ABA-certified anesthesiologists who were active examiners for the primary certification oral examination as of January 2013.; MEASUREMENTS: Fifty-one participating physicians in the patient survey group distributed brochures, which included a link to the MOCA Patient Care Survey, to up to 100 consecutive patients at the point of care. Fifty-one participating physicians in the peer survey group distributed invitations to MOCA Peer Survey via e-mail to 20 peers in a variety of roles. Participants developed and evaluated a practice improvement plan based on survey results. Participants were also surveyed on their opinions on the feasibility of implementing the piloted survey instrument in their practices.; MAIN RESULTS: Response rates for the patient care and the peer surveys were 15% and 75%, respectively. Both surveys indicated a high level of satisfaction with the diplomates; approximately two-thirds of physicians could not identify practice areas in need of improvement.; CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that threats to the validity of these surveys include distribution bias for peer surveys and response bias for patient surveys and that surveys often do not provide actionable information useful for practice improvement. Alternative approaches, such as including anesthesiologists within an integrated institutional evaluation system, could be explored to maximize the benefits of physician assessments provided by peers and patients.

AB One of the greatest challenges facing healthcare professionals is the ability to directly and efficiently access relevant data from the patient's healthcare record at the point of care; specific to both the context of the task being performed and the specific needs and preferences of the individual end-user. In radiology practice, the relative inefficiency of imaging data organization and manual workflow requirements serves as an impediment to historical imaging data review. At the same time, clinical data retrieval is even more problematic due to the quality and quantity of data recorded at the time of order entry, along with the relative lack of information system integration. One approach to address these data deficiencies is to create a multi-disciplinary patient referenceable database which consists of high-priority, actionable data within the cumulative patient healthcare record; in which predefined criteria are used to categorize and classify imaging and clinical data in accordance with anatomy, technology, pathology, and time. The population of this referenceable database can be performed through a combination of manual and automated methods, with an additional step of data verification introduced for data quality control. Once created, these referenceable databases can be filtered at the point of care to provide context and user-specific data specific to the task being performed and individual end-user requirements.

AB This retrospective, descriptive, chart review study was done to demonstrate one strategy for communicating aggregated and actionable fall data to bedside nurses. It was conducted at a nonprofit acute care hospital in the northwestern United States to analyze the quantitative data captured in post-fall audit reports of patient falls (March 1-December 31, 2012, N = 107 falls). Descriptive and binary statistical analyses were used. The quarterly National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators 2011 and 2012 reports showed that implementation of post-fall audit reports can lead to a lower overall fall rate and a lower fall-injury rate. Increased nursing hours could be a confounding factor of the positive impact of conducting post-fall audits in this study. It is concluded that timely and systematic reporting, analysis, and interpretation of fall data in an electronic format can facilitate prevention of falls and fall injuries.  © The Author(s) 2014.

AB Innovation in surgical techniques, technology, and care processes are essential for improving the care and outcomes of surgical patients, including children. The time and cost associated with surgical innovation can be significant, and unless it leads to improvements in outcome at equivalent or lower costs, it adds little or no value from the perspective of the patients, and decreases the overall resources available to our already financially constrained healthcare system. The emergence of a safety and quality mandate in surgery, and the development of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) allow needs-based surgical care innovation which leads to value-based improvement in care. In addition to general and procedure-specific clinical outcomes, surgeons should consider the measurement of quality from the patients' perspective. To this end, the integration of validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) into actionable, benchmarked institutional outcomes reporting has the potential to facilitate quality improvement in process, treatment and technology that optimizes value for our patients and health system.

AB Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an emerging provisional entity included in the 2013 International Society of Urological Pathology Vancouver Classification. Most genomic alterations in patients with SDH-deficient RCCs involve the SDHB subunit, and the associated renal tumors have loss of immunohistochemical SDHB expression and distinctive morphologic features. Renal tumors less commonly possess genomic alterations involving the SDHC and SDHD subunits, but no SDHA alterations have as yet been described. Here we identified a novel SDHA homozygous deletion in an aggressive variant of RCC diagnosed initially as unclassified type in a 54-year-old patient. A search for novel actionable mutations by comprehensive genomic profiling based on clinical next-generation sequencing evaluating entire coding regions of 315 cancer-related genes, including all SDH subunits, was performed. Sequencing identified a novel 17 kbp homozygous deletion of 9 SDHA exons on chromosome 5p15. SDHA and SDHB immunohistochemistry further confirmed that the homozygous deletion led to the loss of SDHA and SDHB protein expression. Histologically, the tumor had a mixed pattern of high-grade papillary and collecting duct carcinoma and distinctive pale eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions similar to those described in SDHB-deficient RCC. This is the first report that identifies SDHA inactivation in RCC. Additional studies utilizing comprehensive genomic profiling, immunohistochemistry, and careful morphologic evaluation are needed both prospectively and retrospectively to identify the group of RCCs harboring SDHA genomic alterations.

AB Lead (Pb) content in lipstick and other consumer products has become an increasing concern. In 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration tested 400 lipstick samples and found a maximum Pb concentration of 7.19ppm. To assess the safety of lipstick in adults that chronically apply lipstick as well as instances where children might incidentally ingest lipstick products, the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA) Adult Lead Model and Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model for Lead in Children were used to determine the blood Pb concentrations of adults and children ingesting varying amounts of lipstick of different Pb concentrations. Modeled blood Pb concentrations were compared with oral ingestion guidelines and to the Centers for Disease Control and the US EPA's actionable blood Pb levels of 5 and 10g/dL. Background Pb exposure was the primary contributor to estimated blood Pb levels (BLLs) in children and adults, and Pb exposure from lipstick did not significantly increase estimated BLLs. These results suggest that the safety of consumer products and cosmetics should be assessed not only by the presence and amounts of hazardous contents, but also in conjunction with an assessment of estimated background exposures and comparison to health-based standards.

AB The role of molecular methods in the diagnosis of head and neck cancer is rapidly evolving and holds great potential for improving outcomes for all patients who suffer from this diverse group of malignancies . However, there is considerable debate as to the best clinical approaches, particularly for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The choices of NGS methods such as whole exome, whole genome, whole transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) or multiple gene resequencing panels, each have strengths and weakness based on data quality, the size of the data, the turnaround time for data analysis, and clinical actionability. There have also been a variety of gene expression signatures established from microarray studies that correlate with relapse and response to treatment, but none of these methods have been implemented as standard of care for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Because many genomic methodologies are still far from the capabilities of most clinical laboratories, we chose to explore the use of a combination of off the shelf targeted mutation analysis and gene expression analysis methods to complement standard anatomical pathology methods. Specifically, we have used the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq cancer panel in combination with the NanoString nCounter Human Cancer Reference Kit on 8 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) OPSCC tumor specimens, (4) HPV-positive and (4) HPV-negative. Differential expression analysis between HPV-positive and negative groups showed that expression of several genes was highly likely to correlate with HPV status. For example, WNT1, PDGFA and OGG1 were all over-expressed in the positive group. Our results show the utility of these methods with routine FFPE clinical specimens to identify potential therapeutic targets which could be readily applied in a clinical trial setting for clinical laboratories lacking the instrumentation or bioinformatics infrastructure to support comprehensive genomics workflows. To the best of our knowledge, these preliminary experiments are among the earliest to combine both mutational and gene expression profiles using Ion Torrent and NanoString technologies. This reports serves as a proof of principle methodology in OPSCC.

AB BACKGROUND: Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella.; RESULTS: We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h.; CONCLUSIONS: Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices.

AB Significant research has been conducted to better understand the extensive, heterogeneous molecular features of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We reviewed published TNBC molecular classifications to identify major groupings that have potential for clinical trial development. With the ultimate aim to streamline translational medicine, we linked these categories of TNBC according to their gene-expression signatures, biological function, and clinical outcome. To this end, we define five potential clinically actionable groupings of TNBC: 1) basal-like TNBC with DNA-repair deficiency or growth factor pathways; 2) mesenchymal-like TNBC with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell features; 3) immune-associated TNBC; 4) luminal/apocrine TNBC with androgen-receptor overexpression; and 5) HER2-enriched TNBC. For each defined subtype, we highlight the major biological pathways and discuss potential targeted therapies in TNBC that might abrogate disease progression. However, many of these potential targets need clinical validation by clinical trials. We have yet to know how we can enrich the targets by molecular classifications.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines for the management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department (ED), variations in practice exist. Interventions designed to implement recommended behaviours can reduce this variation. Using theory to inform intervention development is advocated; however, there is no consensus on how to select or apply theory. Integrative theoretical frameworks, based on syntheses of theories and theoretical constructs relevant to implementation, have the potential to assist in the intervention development process. This paper describes the process of applying two theoretical frameworks to investigate the factors influencing recommended behaviours and the choice of behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery for an implementation intervention.; METHODS: A stepped approach was followed: (i) identification of locally applicable and actionable evidence-based recommendations as targets for change, (ii) selection and use of two theoretical frameworks for identifying barriers to and enablers of change (Theoretical Domains Framework and Model of Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organisations) and (iii) identification and operationalisation of intervention components (behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery) to address the barriers and enhance the enablers, informed by theory, evidence and feasibility/acceptability considerations. We illustrate this process in relation to one recommendation, prospective assessment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) by ED staff using a validated tool.; RESULTS: Four recommendations for managing mild traumatic brain injury were targeted with the intervention. The intervention targeting the PTA recommendation consisted of 14 behaviour change techniques and addressed 6 theoretical domains and 5 organisational domains. The mode of delivery was informed by six Cochrane reviews. It was delivered via five intervention components : (i) local stakeholder meetings, (ii) identification of local opinion leader teams, (iii) a train-the-trainer workshop for appointed local opinion leaders, (iv) local training workshops for delivery by trained local opinion leaders and (v) provision of tools and materials to prompt recommended behaviours.; CONCLUSIONS: Two theoretical frameworks were used in a complementary manner to inform intervention development in managing mild traumatic brain injury in the ED. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the developed intervention is being evaluated in a cluster randomised trial, part of the Neurotrauma Evidence Translation (NET) program.

AB BACKGROUND: Breast cancer comprises multiple tumor entities associated with different biological features and clinical behaviors, making individualized medicine a powerful tool to bring the right drug to the right patient. Next generation sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) is a suitable method to detect targets for individualized treatment. Challenges that arise are i) preprocessing and analyzing RNA-Seq data in the n-of-1 setting, ii) extracting clinically relevant and actionable targets from complex data, iii) integrating drug databases, and iv) reporting results to clinicians in a timely and understandable manner.; RESULTS: To address these challenges, we present OncoRep, an RNA-Seq based n-of-1 reporting tool for breast cancer patients. It reports molecular classification, altered genes and pathways, gene fusions, clinically actionable mutations and drug recommendations. It visualizes the data in an approachable html-based interactive report and a PDF clinical report, providing the clinician and tumor board with a tool to guide the treatment decision making process.; CONCLUSIONS: OncoRep is free and open-source ( https://bitbucket.org/sulab/oncorep/ ), thereby offering a platform for future development and innovation by the community.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the ability of commercial molecular tumor profiling to discover actionable mutations and to identify barriers that might prevent patient access to personalized therapies.; METHODS: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of 26 patients with gynecologic malignancies who underwent commercial tumor profiling at our institution during the first 18 months of test availability. Tumor profiles reported targeted therapies and clinical trials matched to patient-specific mutations. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics.; RESULTS: Most patients who underwent tumor profiling had serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma (46%). Patients underwent profiling after undergoing a median of two systemic therapies (range 0 to 13). A median of one targeted therapy was suggested per patient profile. Tumor profiling identified no clinically actionable mutations for seven patients (27%). Six patients sought insurance approval for a targeted therapy and two were declined (33%). One patient (4%) received a targeted therapy and this was discontinued due to tumor progression.; CONCLUSIONS: There are formidable barriers to targeted therapy for patients with gynecologic malignancies. These barriers include a dearth of FDA-approved targeted agents for gynecologic malignancies, lack of third party insurance coverage and limited geographic availability of clinical trials.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a histologically benign but clinically aggressive brain tumor that arises from the sellar/suprasellar region. Despite a high survival rate with current surgical and radiation therapy (75-95 % at 10 years), ACP is associated with debilitating visual, endocrine, neurocognitive and psychological morbidity, resulting in excheptionally poor quality of life for survivors. Identification of an effective pharmacological therapy could drastically decrease morbidity and improve long term outcomes for children with ACP.; RESULTS: Using mRNA microarray gene expression analysis of 15 ACP patient samples, we have found several pharmaceutical targets that are significantly and consistently overexpressed in our panel of ACP relative to other pediatric brain tumors, pituitary tumors, normal pituitary and normal brain tissue. Among the most highly expressed are several targets of the kinase inhibitor dasatinib - LCK, EPHA2 and SRC; EGFR pathway targets - AREG, EGFR and ERBB3; and other potentially actionable cancer targets - SHH, MMP9 and MMP12. We confirm by western blot that a subset of these targets is highly expressed in ACP primary tumor samples.; CONCLUSIONS: We report here the first published transcriptome for ACP and the identification of targets for rational therapy. Experimental drugs targeting each of these gene products are currently being tested clinically and pre-clinically for the treatment of other tumor types. This study provides a rationale for further pre-clinical and clinical studies of novel pharmacological treatments for ACP. Development of mouse and cell culture models for ACP will further enable the translation of these targets from the lab to the clinic, potentially ushering in a new era in the treatment of ACP.

AB Toward development of a precision medicine framework for metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we established a multi-institutional clinical sequencing infrastructure to conduct prospective whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of bone or soft tissue tumor biopsies from a cohort of 150 mCRPC affected individuals. Aberrations of AR, ETS genes, TP53, and PTEN were frequent (40%-60% of cases), with TP53 and AR alterations enriched in mCRPC compared to primary prostate cancer. We identified new genomic alterations in PIK3CA/B, R-spondin, BRAF/RAF1, APC, beta-catenin, and ZBTB16/PLZF. Moreover, aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM were observed at substantially higher frequencies (19.3% overall) compared to those in primary prostate cancers. 89% of affected individuals harbored a clinically actionable aberration, including 62.7% with aberrations in AR, 65% in other cancer-related genes, and 8% with actionable pathogenic germline alterations. This cohort study provides clinically actionable information that could impact treatment decisions for these affected individuals.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cell-free (cf) DNA in the plasma of cancer patients offers an easily obtainable source of biologic material for mutation analysis. Plasma samples from 157 patients with advanced cancers who progressed on systemic therapy were tested for 21 mutations in BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA using the BEAMing method and results were compared to mutation analysis of archival tumor tissue from a CLIA-certified laboratory obtained as standard of care from diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Results were concordant for archival tissue and plasma cfDNA in 91% cases for BRAF mutations (kappa = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 - 0.88), in 99% cases for EGFR mutations (kappa = 0.90, 95% CI 0.71- 1.00), in 83% cases for KRAS mutations (kappa = 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 - 0.80) and in 91% cases for PIK3CA mutations (kappa = 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 - 0.85). Patients (n = 41) with > 1% of KRAS mutant cfDNA had a shorter median survival compared to 20 patients with </= 1% of KRAS mutant DNA (4.8 vs. 7.3 months, p=0.008). Similarly, 67 patients with >1% of mutant cfDNA (BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, or PIK3CA) had a shorter median survival compared to 33 patients with </= 1% of mutant cfDNA (5.5 vs. 9.8 months, p = 0.001), which was confirmed in multivariable analysis.

AB MOTIVATION: The probability of effective treatment of cancer with a targeted therapeutic can be improved for patients with defined genotypes containing actionable mutations. To this end, many human cancer biobanks are integrating more tightly with genomic sequencing facilities and with those creating and maintaining patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and cell lines to provide renewable resources for translational research.; RESULTS: To support the complex data management needs and workflows of several such biobanks, we developed Acquire. It is a robust, secure, web-based, database-backed open-source system that supports all major needs of a modern cancer biobank. Its modules allow for i) up-to-the-minute 'scoreboard' and graphical reporting of collections; ii) end user roles and permissions; iii) specimen inventory through caTissue Suite; iv) shipping forms for distribution of specimens to pathology, genomic analysis and PDX/cell line creation facilities; v) robust ad hoc querying; vi) molecular and cellular quality control metrics to track specimens' progress and quality; vii) public researcher request; viii) resource allocation committee distribution request review and oversight and ix) linkage to available derivatives of specimen. © The Author 2015.

AB The past decade has been transformative for lung cancer patients, physicians, and scientists. The discovery of EGFR mutations that confer sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung adenocarcinomas in 2004 heralded the beginning of the era of precision medicine for lung cancer. Indeed, it precipitated concerted efforts by many investigators to define molecular subgroups of lung cancer, characterize the genomic landscape of lung cancer subtypes, identify novel therapeutic targets, and define mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to targeted therapies. The fruits of these efforts are visible every day now in lung cancer clinics: Patients receive molecular testing to determine whether their tumor harbors an actionable mutation, new and improved targeted therapies that can overcome resistance to first-generation drugs are in clinical trials, and drugs targeting the immune system are showing activity in patients. This extraordinary promise is tempered by the sobering fact that even the newest treatments for metastatic disease are rarely curative and are effective only in a small fraction of all patients. Ongoing and future efforts to find new vulnerabilities of lung cancers, unravel the complexity of drug resistance, increase the efficacy of immunotherapies, and perform biomarker-driven clinical trials are necessary to improve outcomes for patients with lung cancer. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Squamous cell lung cancer (SCC) represents an area of unmet need in lung cancer research. For the past several years, therapeutic progress in SCC has lagged behind the now more common non-small cell lung cancer histologic subtype of adenocarcinoma. However, recent efforts to define the complex biology underlying SCC have begun to bear fruit in a multitude of ways, including characterization of previously unknown genomic and signaling pathways, delineation of new, potentially actionable molecular targets, and subsequent development of a large number of agents directed against unique SCC-associated molecular abnormalities. For the first time, SCC-specific prognostic gene signatures and predictive biomarkers of new therapeutic agents are emerging. In addition, recent and ongoing clinical trials, including the Lung-MAP master protocol, have been designed to facilitate approval of targeted therapy-biomarker combinations. In this comprehensive review, we describe the current status of SCC therapeutics, recent advances in the understanding of SCC biology and prognostic gene signatures, and the development of innovative new clinical trials, all of which offer new hope for patients with advanced SCC. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Significant progress has been made in the past 50 years across the field of oncology, and, as a result, the number of cancer survivors in the United States is more than 14.5 million. In fact, the number of cancer survivors continues to grow on an annual basis, which is due in part to improved treatments that help people with cancer live longer, and improvements in early detection that allow doctors to find cancer earlier when the disease is easier to treat. However, in spite of this progress, innovation in cancer research and care is at risk as the rise in health care spending is leading to significant pressure to contain costs. As the oncology community seeks to ensure that innovation in cancer research and care continues, it is imperative that stakeholders focus their attention on the value that the research and care continuum provides. Over the past several years, the Turning the Tide Against Cancer initiative has worked with the cancer community to accelerate the delivery of patient-centered, high-quality cancer research and care, while addressing value and cost. This article highlights policy recommendations that resulted from the convening of an expert working group comprising leaders from across the oncology field. Of the recommendations, the co-conveners have identified several issue areas that merit particular focus in 2015: Support FDA's efforts to modernize its framework for bringing new medicines to patients, through facilitating and implementing innovative approaches to drug development and regulatory review. Ensure that cancer clinical pathways or similar decision-support tools are transparent; developed through a physician-driven process that includes patient input; and meet minimum standards for clinical appropriateness, timeliness, and patient centeredness. Support oncology decision-support tools that are timely, clinically appropriate, and patient centered. Build on existing efforts to convene a multistakeholder committee and develop a report on ways to define and measure value in oncology care, taking into account many of the complex dynamics associated with measuring value, including the interests and needs of patients, as well as the importance of committed and ongoing support for innovative research.These policy options are intended to further the national dialogue and represent meaningful and actionable steps toward supporting cancer research and care that is innovative, efficient, and focused on the patient. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement.; OBJECTIVE: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions.; METHODS: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions.; RESULTS: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001).; CONCLUSIONS: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02359981; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02359981 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6YCeoN8nv).

AB Mesothelin is a cell surface glycoprotein which is highly expressed in several epithelial cancers and may have a role in cell adhesion and metastases. In this study, we used prospectively obtained clinical and pathological data to characterize mesothelin expression in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Tissue was obtained from patients who underwent molecular profiling of potentially actionable genes on a trial of molecular profiling and targeted therapies in advanced thoracic malignancies. We immunohistochemically evaluated the intensity, and the percentage of cells expressing mesothelin in 93 advanced lung adenocarcinomas. The evaluation was blinded for molecular data and outcome. Mutations of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, AKT1, PIK3CA and HER2 were assessed by pyrosequencing; HER2 amplification and ALK translocation were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. 53% of advanced lung adenocarcinomas expressed mesothelin to some degree; high mesothelin expression, defined as mesothelin positivity in more than 25% of cells, was found in 24% of patients. High mesothelin expression was associated with inferior survival (median 18.2 months vs. 32.9 months; P = 0.014). High mesothelin expression was strongly associated with mutant KRAS (P < 0.0001) and wild-type EGFR (P = 0.002). Our results provide strong rationale to explore anti-mesothelin targeted therapies in advanced lung adenocarcinoma especially in the KRAS-mutant subgroup.

AB BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are malignant cells that have migrated from solid cancers into the blood, where they are typically present in rare numbers. There is great interest in using CTCs to monitor response to therapies, to identify clinically actionable biomarkers, and to provide a non-invasive window on the molecular state of a tumor. Here we characterize the performance of the AccuCyte--CyteFinder system, a comprehensive, reproducible and highly sensitive platform for collecting, identifying and retrieving individual CTCs from microscopic slides for molecular analysis after automated immunofluorescence staining for epithelial markers.; METHODS: All experiments employed a density-based cell separation apparatus (AccuCyte) to separate nucleated cells from the blood and transfer them to microscopic slides. After staining, the slides were imaged using a digital scanning microscope (CyteFinder). Precisely counted model CTCs (mCTCs) from four cancer cell lines were spiked into whole blood to determine recovery rates. Individual mCTCs were removed from slides using a single-cell retrieval device (CytePicker) for whole genome amplification and subsequent analysis by PCR and Sanger sequencing, whole exome sequencing, or array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Clinical CTCs were evaluated in blood samples from patients with different cancers in comparison with the CellSearch system.; RESULTS: AccuCyte--CyteFinder presented high-resolution images that allowed identification of mCTCs by morphologic and phenotypic features. Spike-in mCTC recoveries were between 90 and 91%. More than 80% of single-digit spike-in mCTCs were identified and even a single cell in 7.5 mL could be found. Analysis of single SKBR3 mCTCs identified presence of a known TP53 mutation by both PCR and whole exome sequencing, and confirmed the reported karyotype of this cell line. Patient sample CTC counts matched or exceeded CellSearch CTC counts in a small feasibility cohort.; CONCLUSION: The AccuCyte--CyteFinder system is a comprehensive and sensitive platform for identification and characterization of CTCs that has been applied to the assessment of CTCs in cancer patient samples as well as the isolation of single cells for genomic analysis. It thus enables accurate non-invasive monitoring of CTCs and evolving cancer biology for personalized, molecularly-guided cancer treatment.

AB Progressive EMS organizations need to be monitoring, capturing and measuring data continuously, in real-time and near-real-time to ensure quality patient care and optimum clinical and operational performance. Previously, this required exhaustive staff time and efforts, cobbling data together manually from various sources. We can now use EMS technologies to make useful, actionable decisions in near-real-time based on the data we collect--all as close to the event as possible. While technology is fantastic, it's still very important to keep an overall focus on the patient. "Treat the patient, not the monitor" is a very common sentiment heard in paramedic training programs around the world. The availability of technology doesn't preclude this statement. While crew members performing tasks on scene should concentrate on the job at hand, when possible, there should be a team leader that watches over the entire scene to help provide real-time direction and feedback. Crews can see what they are doing while they are doing it and it improves outcomes. Real-time and near-real-time information and feedback shows leaders where their system is headed. It gives our patients the best chance at the best outcomes, and gives our EMS systems the best chance to improve and provide measurable outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present the results of a pilot study of an innovative methodology for translating best evidence about spinal cord injury (SCI) for family practice.; DESIGN: Review of Canadian and international peer-reviewed literature to develop SCI Actionable Nuggets, and a mixed qualitative-quantitative evaluation to determine Nuggets' effect on physician knowledge of and attitudes toward patients with SCI, as well as practice accessibility.; SETTING: Ontario, Newfoundland, and Australia.; PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine primary care physicians.; METHODS: Twenty Actionable Nuggets (pertaining to key health issues associated with long-term SCI) were developed. Nugget postcards were mailed weekly for 20 weeks to participating physicians. Prior knowledge of SCI was self-rated by participants; they also completed an online posttest to assess the information they gained from the Nugget postcards. Participants' opinions about practice accessibility and accommodations for patients with SCI, as well as the acceptability and usefulness of Nuggets, were assessed in interviews.; MAIN FINDINGS: With Actionable Nuggets, participants' knowledge of the health needs of patients with SCI improved, as knowledge increased from a self-rating of fair (58%) to very good (75%) based on posttest quiz results. The mean overall score for accessibility and accommodations in physicians' practices was 72%. Participants' awareness of the need for screening and disease prevention among this population also increased. The usefulness and acceptability of SCI Nugget postcards were rated as excellent.; CONCLUSION: Actionable Nuggets are a knowledge translation tool designed to provide family physicians with concise, practical information about the most prevalent and pressing primary care needs of patients with SCI. This evidence-based resource has been shown to be an excellent fit with information consumption processes in primary care. They were updated and adapted for distribution by the Canadian Medical Association to approximately 50,000 primary care physicians in Canada, in both English and French.

AB PURPOSE: Advances in tumor biology and multiplex genomic analysis have ushered in the era of precision cancer medicine. Little is currently known, however, about the landscape of prospective "precision cancer medicine" clinical trials in the U.S.; METHODS: We identified all adult interventional cancer trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between September 2005 and May 2013. Trials were classified as "precision cancer medicine" if a genomic alteration in a predefined set of 88 genes was required for enrollment. Baseline characteristics were ascertained for each trial.; RESULTS: Of the initial 18,797 trials identified, 9094 (48%) were eligible for inclusion: 684 (8%) were classified as precision cancer medicine trials and 8410 (92%) were non-precision cancer medicine trials. Compared with non-precision cancer medicine trials, precision cancer medicine trials were significantly more likely to be phase II [RR 1.19 (1.10-1.29), p<0.001], multi-center [RR 1.18 (1.11-1.26), p<0.001], open-label [RR 1.04 (1.02-1.07), p=0.005] and involve breast [RR 4.03 (3.49-4.52), p<0.001], colorectal [RR 1.62 (1.22-2.14), p=0.002] and skin [RR 1.98 (1.55-2.54), p<0.001] cancers. Precision medicine trials required 38 unique genomic alterations for enrollment. The proportion of precision cancer medicine trials compared to the total number of trials increased from 3% in 2006 to 16% in 2013.; CONCLUSION: The proportion of adult cancer clinical trials in the U.S. requiring a genomic alteration for enrollment has increased substantially over the past several years. However, such trials still represent a small minority of studies performed within the cancer clinical trials enterprise and include a small subset of putatively "actionable" alterations.

AB During the last decade, thoracic oncology has witnessed an unprecedented outburst of knowledge regarding molecular biology of non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The implementation of high-throughput sequencing analysis and genomic technologies has led to the identification of novel molecular events that characterize NSCLC transformation and may represent critical oncogenic drivers amenable to targeted therapy. Among these, the presence of activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and of chromosomic rearrangements in the anaplastic-lymphoma kinase (ALK) proto-oncogene, have been the first well characterized genetic alterations with corresponding targeted agents to enter the clinical arena. Nevertheless, in the recent years a number of other oncogenic drivers beyond EGFR and ALK inhibition have emerged as novel molecular targets with potential therapeutic implications, including mutations in the genes KRAS, BRAF, HER2, PI3KCA and DDR2, as well as ROS1 and RET rearrangements and MET, HER2 and FGFR1 gene amplifications. The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive information on the novel therapeutic targets identified by recent preclinical evidence and to discuss developments in molecular treatments targeting these oncogenic drivers or actionable mutations beyond EGFR and ALK in advanced NSCLC.

AB Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are heterogeneous and especially the midgut tumors currently lack effective therapy options. Actionable driver mutations as therapeutic targets are rare. Subtype specific data concerning regulatory mechanisms or epigenetic aberrations are necessary for novel clinical trials. Although the p53 protein itself is rarely mutated in GEP-NENs, epigenetic and regulatory aberrations interfere with the p53 network activity and might function as s target for novel therapeutic approaches. In this review we analyze the current knowledge about the p53 network in GEP-NENs and discuss three possible strategies that include recovering p53 function, enforcing apoptosis by genotoxic stress induction and restoring silenced gene function, based on in vitro, in vivo and clinical data.

AB In 2000, 189 member states of the United Nations (UN) developed a plan for peace and development, which resulted in eight actionable goals known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since their inception, the MDGs have been considered the international standard for measuring development progress and have provided a blueprint for global health policy and programming. However, emphasis upon the achievement of priority benchmarks around the "big three" diseases--namely HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria--has influenced global health entities to disproportionately allocate resources. Meanwhile, several tropical diseases that almost exclusively impact the poorest of the poor continue to be neglected, despite the existence of cost-effective and feasible methods of control or elimination. One such Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), onchocerciasis, more commonly known as river blindness, is a debilitating and stigmatizing disease primarily affecting individuals living in remote and impoverished areas. Onchocerciasis control is considered to be one of the most successful and cost-effective public health campaigns ever launched. In addition to improving the health and well-being of millions of individuals, these programs also lead to improvements in education, agricultural production, and economic development in affected communities. Perhaps most pertinent to the global health community, though, is the demonstrated effectiveness of facilitating community engagement by allowing communities considerable ownership with regard to drug delivery. This paper reviews the contributions that such concentrated efforts to control and eliminate onchocerciasis make to achieving select MDGs. The authors hope to draw the attention of public policymakers and global health funders to the importance of the struggle against onchocerciasis as a model for community-directed interventions to advance health and development, and to advocate for NTDs inclusion in the post 2015 agenda.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: The treatment of sarcomas has been challenging due to their heterogeneity, rarity in the general population, relative insensitivity to chemotherapeutics, and lack of effective targeted agents. One of the first major breakthroughs in the treatment of sarcomas was the use of imatinib to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Since then, advanced molecular techniques and genetic profiling have revolutionized the approach to sarcoma classification, diagnosis, prognosis and, most importantly, treatment. As the sarcoma genetic database continues to expand, the basis for how we classify, diagnose, and treat these challenging malignancies will be redefined. The overall goal of these types of techniques has been to determine a molecular blueprint for each sarcoma subtype and discover actionable alterations that lend themselves to targeted therapies. Other important information derived from these large genomic databases includes biomarkers, prognostic indicators, and information regarding tumorigenesis. Eventually, advanced molecular techniques will provide a personalized-medicine approach that tailors each treatment regimen to the patient's own tumor genome.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a parsimonious and actionable model of effective technology use (ETU).; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of primary care providers (n=53) in a large integrated health care organization that recently implemented new medication reconciliation technology.; METHODS: Surveys assessed 5 technology-related perceptions (compatibility with work values, implementation climate, compatibility with work processes, perceived usefulness, and ease of use) and 1 outcome variable, ETU. ETU was measured as both consistency and quality of technology use.; RESULTS: Compatibility with work values and implementation climate were found to have differential effects on consistency and quality of use. When implementation climate was strong, consistency of technology use was high. However, quality of technology use was high only when implementation climate was strong and values compatibility was high. This is an important finding and highlights the importance of users' workplace values as a key determinant of quality of use.; CONCLUSIONS: To extend our effectiveness in implementing new health care information technology, we need parsimonious models that include actionable determinants of ETU and account for the differential effects of these determinants on the multiple dimensions of ETU. © The Author 2015.

AB There has been increasing awareness of the incidence and potential long-term consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in children and young adults. While parents, school systems, and athletic programs are clamoring for evidence-based guidelines, the field remains primitive in understanding the factors resulting in a spectrum of individual outcomes, most of which are complete, but some of which are not. In this article, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, clinical presentation, course, and outcomes of mTBI, with a focus on the pediatric population as the context for reviewing the mechanisms and pathophysiology mediating, and biomarkers reflective of, more significant concussion-induced brain injury. Our goal is to present a general overview of the features of mTBI in the pediatric population in order to provide a conceptual model for pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists. This model emphasizes the importance of establishing actionable, noninvasive biomarkers that are reflective of brain injury and that may identify those pediatric patients who can benefit from earlier and more aggressive interventions. We will focus on the specific features of mTBI in pediatric patients; although given the relative lack of research in the pediatric population, we will also extrapolate from research on adults.  © 2015 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB These NCCN Guidelines Insights focus on recent updates to the 2015 NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Appropriate targeted therapy is very effective in patients with advanced NSCLC who have specific genetic alterations. Therefore, it is important to test tumor tissue from patients with advanced NSCLC to determine whether they have genetic alterations that make them candidates for specific targeted therapies. These NCCN Guidelines Insights describe the different testing methods currently available for determining whether patients have genetic alterations in the 2 most commonly actionable genetic alterations, notably anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements and sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.

AB The advent of widespread cancer genome sequencing has accelerated our understanding of the molecular aberrations underlying malignant disease at an unprecedented rate. Coupling the large number of bioinformatic methods developed to locate genomic breakpoints with increased sequence read length and a deeper understanding of coding region function has enabled rapid identification of novel actionable oncogenic fusion genes. Using examples of kinase fusions found in liquid and solid tumours, this review highlights major concepts that have arisen in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis through the study of fusion proteins. We provide an overview of recently developed methods to identify potential fusion proteins from next-generation sequencing data, describe the validation of their oncogenic potential and discuss the role of targetted therapies in treating cancers driven by fusion oncoproteins.  © 2015 Societe Francaise des Microscopies and Societe de Biologie Cellulaire de France.

AB This special issue explores a range of health information technology (HIT) issues that can help primary care practices and patients. Findings address the design of HIT systems, primarily electronic health records (EHRs), the utility of various functionalities, and implementation strategies that ensure the greatest value. The articles also remind us that, while HIT can support the delivery of care, it is not a panacea. To be effective, functionality needs to be relevant and timely for both the clinician and patient. Prompts and better documentation can improve care, and "prompt fatigue" is not inevitable. Information presented within EHRs needs to be actionable. There is an ongoing tension between information overload and the right-and helpful-information. Even the order of presentation of information can make a difference in the outcome. Whether supported by HIT or not, basic tenants of care, such as including the whole care team in trainings, communicating with other providers, and engaging patients, remain essential. The studies in this issue will prove useful for informatics developers, practices and health systems making HIT decisions, and care teams refining HIT to support the needs of their patients.  © Copyright 2015 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB OBJECTIVES: Describe safety and postoperative sequelae of pediatric otologic surgery and identify predictive factors for postoperative events.; STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database.; SETTING: Data pooled from the 2012 NSQIP-P public use file (50 institutions).; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Current procedural terminology codes were used to identify children who underwent otologic surgery. Variables of interest included demographics and 30-day postoperative events grouped as reoperation, readmission, and complication. Event rates were determined and prevalence of events compared by procedure type and within patient subgroups according to chi-square analysis. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated predictive factors for postoperative events.; RESULTS: Of 37,319 pediatric operations, 2556 (6.8%) were otologic procedures. The most common procedure was tympanoplasty (n = 893, 34.9%), followed by myringoplasty (n = 741, 30.0%), cochlear implantation (n = 464, 18.2%), and tympanomastoidectomy (n = 458, 17.9%). There were 9 reoperations (0.4%), 32 readmissions (1.3%), and 18 complications (0.7%). Children undergoing tympanomastoidectomy or cochlear implantation were more likely to be readmitted irrespective of other factors (odds ratio = 5.5, P = .010; odds ratio = 3.5, P = .083). Children <3 years old were 4 times more likely to be readmitted than older children (odds ratio = 4.4, P < .001).; CONCLUSION: Pediatric otologic procedures are common and have low rates of global 30-day postoperative events. Tympanomastoidectomy and cochlear implantation have the highest risk of 30-day readmission. Young children (<3 years) are more likely to be readmitted following these procedures. Further optimization of the NSQIP-P to include specialty and procedure-specific variables is necessary to assess complete, actionable outcomes of pediatric otologic surgery, however the present study provides a foundation to build upon for safety and quality improvement initiatives in pediatric otology. © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2015.

AB PURPOSE: Personalized medicine strategies using genomic profiling are particularly pertinent for pancreas cancer. The Individualized Molecular Pancreatic Cancer Therapy (IMPaCT) trial was initially designed to exploit results from genome sequencing of pancreatic cancer under the auspices of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) in Australia. Sequencing revealed small subsets of patients with aberrations in their tumor genome that could be targeted with currently available therapies.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The pilot stage of the IMPaCT trial assessed the feasibility of acquiring suitable tumor specimens for molecular analysis and returning high-quality actionable genomic data within a clinically acceptable timeframe. We screened for three molecular targets: HER2 amplification; KRAS wild-type; and mutations in DNA damage repair pathways (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM).; RESULTS: Tumor biopsy and archived tumor samples were collected from 93 patients and 76 were screened. To date 22 candidate cases have been identified: 14 KRAS wild-type, 5 cases of HER2 amplification, 2 mutations in BRCA2, and 1 ATM mutation. Median time from consent to the return of validated results was 21.5 days. An inability to obtain a biopsy or insufficient tumor content in the available specimen were common reasons for patient exclusion from molecular analysis while deteriorating performance status prohibited a number of patients from proceeding in the study.; CONCLUSIONS: Documenting the feasibility of acquiring and screening biospecimens for actionable molecular targets in real time will aid other groups embarking on similar trials. Key elements include the need to better prescreen patients, screen more patients, and offer more attractive clinical trial options. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Targeted therapy has become a valuable approach in adenocarcinoma of the lung. The number of actionable mutations has been continuously increasing with significant acceleration from discovery to clinical application. Herein, we present a case of innovative treatment using targeted therapy of a 75-year-old female with two primary adenocarcinomas of the lung. The first tumor was found to carry an activating mutation in the exon 19 of the epidermal growth factor receptor and responded favorably to treatment with erlotinib. The second primary tumor was found to carry an isolated amplification of the c-met gene but no epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. Off-label use of crizotinib, a potent inhibitor of c-met, was prescribed. Within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, the tumor and the dependent lymphadenopathy responded with rapid shrinkage. This observation stresses the need for rebiopsy of tumors upon progression or change of biological behavior for selection of appropriate targeted therapy.

AB Patient centered care (PCC) is an essential dimension of healthcare systems' mission worldwide and is recognized as an important condition for ensuring the quality of care. Nonetheless, it is also acknowledged that various care providers perceive patient centeredness differently and that there remain several unanswered questions about the aspects of healthcare delivery that are linked to an actual achievement of PCC. In the paper, we categorize the current research on PCC into two streams ("dyadic" and "organizational") and we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each. Despite their important contributions to healthcare services research, these approaches to PCC do not fully capture the network of practices and relationships constituting patients and providers' experiences within healthcare contexts. Therefore, we propose an alternative interpretation of PCC that integrates insights from "practice theories" and emphasizes the negotiated and local nature of patient centeredness, which is accomplished through the engagement of providers and patients in everyday care practices. To develop such interpretation, we propose a research approach combining ethnographic and reflexive methods. Ethnography can help achieve more nuanced descriptions of what PCC truly encapsulates in the care process by drawing attention to the social and material reality of healthcare contexts. Reflexivity can help disentangle and bring to surface the tacit knowledge spread in everyday care practices and transform it into actionable knowledge, a type of knowledge that may support services improvement toward PCC. We anticipate that such improvement is far from straightforward: an actual achievement of PCC may challenge the interests of different stakeholders and unsettle consolidated habits, hierarchies and power dynamics. This unsettlement, however, can also serve as a necessary condition for engaging in a participative process of internal development. We discuss the outcomes, limitations and benefits of our approach through a hospital case study.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The identification of specific genetic alterations as key oncogenic drivers and the development of targeted therapies are together transforming clinical oncology and creating a pressing need for increased breadth and throughput of clinical genotyping. Next-generation sequencing assays allow the efficient and unbiased detection of clinically actionable mutations. To enable precision oncology in patients with solid tumors, we developed Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay for targeted deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of 341 key cancer genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. Barcoded libraries from patient-matched tumor and normal samples were captured, sequenced, and subjected to a custom analysis pipeline to identify somatic mutations. Sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility of MSK-IMPACT were assessed through extensive analytical validation. We tested 284 tumor samples with previously known point mutations and insertions/deletions in 47 exons of 19 cancer genes. All known variants were accurately detected, and there was high reproducibility of inter- and intrarun replicates. The detection limit for low-frequency variants was approximately 2% for hotspot mutations and 5% for nonhotspot mutations. Copy number alterations and structural rearrangements were also reliably detected. MSK-IMPACT profiles oncogenic DNA alterations in clinical solid tumor samples with high accuracy and sensitivity. Paired analysis of tumors and patient-matched normal samples enables unambiguous detection of somatic mutations to guide treatment decisions.

AB 'Photovoice', a community-based participatory research methodology, uses images as a tool to deconstruct problems by posing meaningful questions in a community to find actionable solutions. This community-enhancing technique was used to elicit experiences of climate change among women in rural Nepal. The current analysis employs mixed methods to explore the subjective mental health experience of participating in a 4- to 5-day photovoice process focused on climate change. A secondary objective of this work was to explore whether or not photovoice training, as a one-time 4- to 5-day intensive intervention, can mobilise people to be more aware of environmental changes related to climate change and to be more resilient to these changes, while providing positive mental health outcomes.

AB One of the challenges associated with high-volume, diverse datasets is whether synthesis of open data streams can translate into actionable knowledge. Recognizing that challenge and other issues related to these types of data, the National Institutes of Health developed the Big Data to Knowledge or BD2K initiative. The concept of translating "big data to knowledge" is important to the social and behavioral sciences in several respects. First, a general shift to data-intensive science will exert an influence on all scientific disciplines, but particularly on the behavioral and social sciences given the wealth of behavior and related constructs captured by big data sources. Second, science is itself a social enterprise; by applying principles from the social sciences to the conduct of research, it should be possible to ameliorate some of the systemic problems that plague the scientific enterprise in the age of big data. We explore the feasibility of recalibrating the basic mechanisms of the scientific enterprise so that they are more transparent and cumulative; more integrative and cohesive; and more rapid, relevant, and responsive.

AB OBJECTIVES: To control the cost of reference laboratory testing, to ensure that its usage is medically appropriate, and to review the contribution of reference testing to patient care at our institution.; METHODS: A multidisciplinary institutional committee was convened to manage the utilization of reference testing. A subset of tests was designated to be reviewed in real time by a team of clinical pathologists in consultation with clinical subject matter experts.; RESULTS: Twelve percent of testing requests, accounting for approximately 18% of send-out costs, were determined to be clinically unnecessary or would not produce actionable results at that point during that patient's care and were therefore not performed. This intervention, combined with insourcing of frequently requested tests, resulted in a reduction in the costs of reference testing to less than half of that predicted by the rate of growth from 2005 to 2009. Molecular diagnostic tests displayed a higher cost per test than other forms of testing but had a similar degree of clinical impact.; CONCLUSIONS: Formal prospective review of reference laboratory testing requests resulted in substantial cost containment and improved the efficiency of patient care.

AB This study aimed at developing and measuring quality indicators for oesophageal cancer (OC) and gastric cancer (GC) and to support quality improvement for practitioners. Quality indicators were identified from a systematic literature search including clinical guidelines. The selection process involved experts evaluating relevance, reliability, interpretability and actionability of each indicator. Three national databases were linked: the cancer registry, the population registry and the claims database. Completeness and validity of the data were validated before being measured for 10,660 patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2008. From a final set of 29 indicators, 18 were measurable using the available data. In 2008, less than 50% of patients were discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting and less than 90% underwent a computed tomography scan 1 month after incidence date for cancer staging. Five-year relative survival was 22% for OC and 34.3% for GC. The post-operative mortality in OC patients was 4.8% (30days) and 9.9% (90days), whereas it reached 5.6 and 12.0% respectively in GC patients. This study demonstrates the feasibility to develop a set of quality indicators for gastro-oesophageal cancer. A mixed picture of the quality of care was illustrated for some relevant care processes. Nevertheless, 5-year survival is higher than reported in neighbouring countries. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant is the linchpin for US MCH services. The first national performance measures (NPMs) for MCH were instituted in 1997. Changing trends in MCH risk factors, outcomes, health services, data sources, and advances in scientific knowledge, in conjunction with budgetary constraints led the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) to design a new performance measurement system.; METHODS: A workgroup was formed to develop a new system. The following guiding principles were used: (1) Afford States more flexibility and reduce the overall reporting burden; (2) Improve accountability to better document Title V's impact; (3) Develop NPMs that encompass measures in: maternal and women's health, perinatal health, child health, children with special health care needs, adolescent health, and cross-cutting areas.; RESULTS: A three-tiered performance measurement system was proposed with national outcome measures (NOMs), NPMs and evidence-based/informed strategy measures (ESMs). NOMs are the ultimate goals that MCHB and States are attempting to achieve. NPMs are measures, generally associated with processes or programs, shown to affect NOMs. ESMs are evidence-based or informed measures that each State Title V program develops to affect the NPMs. There are 15 NPMs from which States select eight, with at least one from each population area. MCHB will provide the data for the NOMs and NPMs, when possible.; CONCLUSIONS: The new performance measurement system increases the flexibility and reduces the reporting burden for States by allowing them to choose 8 NPMs to target, and increases accountability by having States develop actionable ESMs.; SIGNIFICANCE: The new national performance measure framework for maternal and child health will allow States more flexibility to address their areas of greatest need, reduce their data reporting burden by having the Maternal and Child Health Bureau provide data for the National Outcome and Performance Measures, yet afford States the opportunity to develop measurable strategies to address their selected performance measures.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Understanding the basis of exceptional responses may increase our knowledge of disease biology and the mechanism of action of targeted agents, and identify subpopulations of patients who derive important benefit from drugs that would otherwise not be developed due to lack of sufficient activity in the general population. We will discuss in this review the value of a systematic phenotype-to-genotype approach in these outlier responders to identify actionable therapeutic targets that can help to personalize the delivery of cancer treatment.; RECENT FINDINGS: Genomic mapping of outlier responders by next-generation sequencing is deciphering cancer biology at the individual level and providing insight in the somatic DNA alterations resulting in exceptional sensitivity to targeted agents in mono or combinational therapy.; SUMMARY: In the era of targeted drugs, outlier or exceptional responders are frequently witnessed within early phase clinical trials. The genomic analysis of anecdotal 'exceptional responders' in trials that may otherwise not achieve prespecified efficacy endpoints may lead to the identification of predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies and revitalize or reposition the use of targeted agents in enriched populations. The era of unselected early clinical trials has passed with the advent of genomic-driven medicine and novel adaptive and biomarker-enrichment trials will accelerate drug approval, and overcome the challenges of testing targeted drugs against aberrations with low prevalence.

AB The development of molecularly targeted anticancer agents relies on large panels of tumour-specific preclinical models closely recapitulating the molecular heterogeneity observed in patients. Here we describe the mutational and gene expression analyses of 151 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. We find that the whole spectrum of CRC molecular and transcriptional subtypes, previously defined in patients, is represented in this cell line compendium. Transcriptional outlier analysis identifies RAS/BRAF wild-type cells, resistant to EGFR blockade, functionally and pharmacologically addicted to kinase genes including ALK, FGFR2, NTRK1/2 and RET. The same genes are present as expression outliers in CRC patient samples. Genomic rearrangements (translocations) involving the ALK and NTRK1 genes are associated with the overexpression of the corresponding proteins in CRC specimens. The approach described here can be used to pinpoint CRCs with exquisite dependencies to individual kinases for which clinically approved drugs are already available.

AB Whole human genome sequencing of individuals is becoming rapid and inexpensive, enabling new strategies for using personal genome information to help diagnose, treat, and even prevent human disorders for which genetic variations are causative or are known to be risk factors. Many of the exploding number of newly discovered genetic variations alter the structure, function, dynamics, stability, and/or interactions of specific proteins and RNA molecules. Accordingly, there are a host of opportunities for biochemists and biophysicists to participate in (1) developing tools to allow accurate and sometimes medically actionable assessment of the potential pathogenicity of individual variations and (2) establishing the mechanistic linkage between pathogenic variations and their physiological consequences, providing a rational basis for treatment or preventive care. In this review, we provide an overview of these opportunities and their associated challenges in light of the current status of genomic science and personalized medicine, the latter often termed precision medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Service disengagement is a pervasive challenge the mental health care system faces. Mental health services are of little value should persons with mental illnesses continue to opt out of receiving them. Consumers attribute disengagement from care to an absence of choice in their treatment. In response, the mental health system is adopting a person-centered model, based upon recovery principles, to engage consumers more actively in their care. Person-centered care planning is a promising practice involving collaboration to develop and implement an actionable plan to assist the person in achieving personal recovery goals.; METHODS/DESIGN: This study design combines a parallel-group randomized controlled trial of community mental health organizations with qualitative methods to assess the effectiveness of person-centered care planning. Participants at 14 sites in Delaware and Connecticut will be randomized to treatment as usual or the person-centered care planning intervention. Participants will be in leadership (n = 70) or supervisory or direct care (n = 210) roles. The person-centered care planning intervention involves intensive staff training and 12 months of ongoing technical assistance. Quantitative survey data will be collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months measuring person-centered care planning competency and organizational factors. Consumer outcomes (engagement, medication adherence, functioning and consumer satisfaction) will be assessed by Medicaid and state-level data. Qualitative data focused on process factors will include staff and consumer interviews and focus groups. In this intent-to-treat analysis, we will use mixed-effects multivariate regression models to evaluate the differential impact of the person-centered care planning intervention on each consumer and implementation outcome as well as the extent to which clinician assessments of organizational factors are associated with the implementation outcome. Mixed methods will triangulate and strengthen the interpretation of outcomes.; DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to generate valuable guidance for state systems engaged in scale-up and transformation efforts. Targeted staff selection for training to support sustainability will serve to provide further insight into important intervention implementation strategies. Person-centered care planning has the potential to enhance the impact of all evidence-based and recovery-oriented practices and bring practice into line with the emerging national guidelines in health care reform.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02299492) on 21 November 2014 as New York University Protocol Record PCCP-13-9762, Person-Centered Care Planning and Service Engagement.

AB Massively parallel sequencing approaches are beginning to be used clinically to characterize individual patient tumors and to select therapies based on the identified mutations. A major question in these analyses is the extent to which these methods identify clinically actionable alterations and whether the examination of the tumor tissue alone is sufficient or whether matched normal DNA should also be analyzed to accurately identify tumor-specific (somatic) alterations. To address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated 815 tumor-normal paired samples from patients of 15 tumor types. We identified genomic alterations using next-generation sequencing of whole exomes or 111 targeted genes that were validated with sensitivities >95% and >99%, respectively, and specificities >99.99%. These analyses revealed an average of 140 and 4.3 somatic mutations per exome and targeted analysis, respectively. More than 75% of cases had somatic alterations in genes associated with known therapies or current clinical trials. Analyses of matched normal DNA identified germline alterations in cancer-predisposing genes in 3% of patients with apparently sporadic cancers. In contrast, a tumor-only sequencing approach could not definitively identify germline changes in cancer-predisposing genes and led to additional false-positive findings comprising 31% and 65% of alterations identified in targeted and exome analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing analyses are essential for precise identification and interpretation of somatic and germline alterations and have important implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients.

AB Deciphering whether actionable driver mutations are found in all or a subset of tumor cells will likely be required to improve drug development and precision medicine strategies. We analyzed nine cancer types to determine the subclonal frequencies of driver events, to time mutational processes during cancer evolution, and to identify drivers of subclonal expansions. Although mutations in known driver genes typically occurred early in cancer evolution, we also identified later subclonal "actionable" mutations, including BRAF (V600E), IDH1 (R132H), PIK3CA (E545K), EGFR (L858R), and KRAS (G12D), which may compromise the efficacy of targeted therapy approaches. More than 20% of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas, and 15% of mutations in genes in the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling axis across all tumor types were subclonal. Mutations in the RAS-MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) signaling axis were less likely to be subclonal than mutations in genes associated with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. Analysis of late mutations revealed a link between APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and the acquisition of subclonal driver mutations and uncovered putative cancer genes involved in subclonal expansions, including CTNNA2 and ATXN1. Our results provide a pan-cancer census of driver events within the context of intratumor heterogeneity and reveal patterns of tumor evolution across cancers. The frequent presence of subclonal driver mutations suggests the need to stratify targeted therapy response according to the proportion of tumor cells in which the driver is identified.

AB INTRODUCTION: Recent discoveries in cancer research have revealed a plethora of clinically actionable mutations that provide therapeutic, prognostic and predictive benefit to patients. The feasibility of screening mutations as part of the routine clinical care of patients remains relatively unexplored as the demonstration of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of tumours in the general population is required to assess its value towards the health-care system.; METHODS: Cancer 2015 study is a large-scale, prospective, multisite cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients from Victoria, Australia with 1094 patients recruited. MPS was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel.; RESULTS: Overall, 854 patients were successfully sequenced for 48 common cancer genes. Accurate determination of clinically relevant mutations was possible including in less characterised cancer types; however, technical limitations including formalin-induced sequencing artefacts were uncovered. Applying strict filtering criteria, clinically relevant mutations were identified in 63% of patients, with 26% of patients displaying a mutation with therapeutic implications. A subset of patients was validated for canonical mutations using the Agena Bioscience MassARRAY system with 100% concordance. Whereas the prevalence of mutations was consistent with other institutionally based series for some tumour streams (breast carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma), others were different (lung adenocarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), which has significant implications for health economic modelling of particular targeted agents. Actionable mutations in tumours not usually thought to harbour such genetic changes were also identified.; CONCLUSIONS: Reliable delivery of a diagnostic assay able to screen for a range of actionable mutations in this cohort was achieved, opening unexpected avenues for investigation and treatment of cancer patients.

AB Hyperbilirubinaemia is a ubiquitous transitional morbidity in the vast majority of newborns and a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life worldwide. While timely and effective phototherapy and exchange transfusion are well proven treatments for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, inappropriate or ineffective treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia, at secondary and tertiary hospitals, still prevails in many poorly-resourced countries accounting for a disproportionately high burden of bilirubin-induced mortality and long-term morbidity. As part of the efforts to curtail the widely reported risks of frequent but avoidable bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with significant resource constraints, this article presents a practical framework for the management of late-preterm and term infants (≥ 35 weeks of gestation) with clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia in these countries particularly where local practice guidelines are lacking. Standard and validated protocols were followed in adapting available evidence-based national guidelines on the management of hyperbilirubinaemia through a collaboration among clinicians and experts on newborn jaundice from different world regions. Tasks and resources required for the comprehensive management of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery are proposed, covering primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and follow-up. Additionally, actionable treatment or referral levels for phototherapy and exchange transfusion are proposed within the context of several confounding factors such as widespread exclusive breastfeeding, infections, blood group incompatibilities and G6PD deficiency, which place infants at high risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in LMICs, as well as the limited facilities for clinical investigations and inconsistent functionality of available phototherapy devices. The need to adjust these levels as appropriate depending on the available facilities in each clinical setting and the risk profile of the infant is emphasised with a view to avoiding over-treatment or under-treatment. These recommendations should serve as a valuable reference material for health workers, guide the development of contextually-relevant national guidelines in each LMIC, as well as facilitate effective advocacy and mobilisation of requisite resources for the optimal care of infants with hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels.

AB BACKGROUND: To date, there have been no reports characterizing the genome-wide somatic DNA chromosomal copy-number alteration landscape in metastatic urothelial carcinoma. We sought to characterize the DNA copy-number profile in a cohort of metastatic samples and compare them to a cohort of primary urothelial carcinoma samples in order to identify changes that are associated with progression from primary to metastatic disease.; METHODS: Using molecular inversion probe array analysis we compared genome-wide chromosomal copy-number alterations between 30 metastatic and 29 primary UC samples. Whole transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis was also performed in primary and matched metastatic samples which was available for 9 patients.; RESULTS: Based on a focused analysis of 32 genes in which alterations may be clinically actionable, there were significantly more amplifications/deletions in metastases (8.6% vs 4.5%, p<0.001). In particular, there was a higher frequency of E2F3 amplification in metastases (30% vs 7%, p=0.046). Paired primary and metastatic tissue was available for 11 patients and 3 of these had amplifications of potential clinical relevance in metastases that were not in the primary tumor including ERBB2, CDK4, CCND1, E2F3, and AKT1. The transcriptional activity of these amplifications was supported by RNA expression data.; CONCLUSIONS: The discordance in alterations between primary and metastatic tissue may be of clinical relevance in the era of genomically directed precision cancer medicine.

AB BACKGROUND: Databases of perturbation gene expression signatures and drug sensitivity provide a powerful framework to develop personalized medicine approaches, by helping to identify actionable genomic markers and subgroups of patients who may benefit from targeted treatments.; RESULTS: Here we use a perturbation expression signature database encompassing perturbations of over 90 cancer genes, in combination with a large breast cancer expression dataset and a novel statistical denoising algorithm, to help discern cancer perturbations driving most of the variation in breast cancer gene expression. Clustering estrogen receptor positive cancers over the perturbation activity scores recapitulates known luminal subtypes. Analysis of individual activity scores enables identification of a novel cancer subtype, defined by a 31-gene AKT-signaling module. Specifically, we show that activation of this module correlates with a poor prognosis in over 900 endocrine-treated breast cancers, a result we validate in two independent cohorts. Importantly, breast cancer cell lines with high activity of the module respond preferentially to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, a result we also validate in two independent datasets. We find that at least 34 % of the downregulated AKT module genes are either mediators of apoptosis or have tumor suppressor functions.; CONCLUSIONS: The statistical framework advocated here could be used to identify gene modules that correlate with prognosis and sensitivity to alternative treatments. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test whether the 31-gene AKT module could be used to identify estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients who may benefit from therapy targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis.

AB BACKGROUND: Soft-tissue neoplasms embody a histologically diverse group of mesenchymal tumors. Oftentimes the histopathological diagnosis of soft-tissue tumors is challenging due to overlapping pathological features.; METHODS: We reviewed the current and most importantly known recurrent or tumor-specific genetic abnormalities involving soft-tissue tumors, focusing on how they are useful in working up differential diagnoses and the relevance of potentially targeted therapies.; RESULTS: Molecular diagnostic tools have shown great advantage as an aid in the differentiation between different soft-tissue tumor entities, providing a potential avenue in the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a well-known example of a soft-tissue tumor with a successful, molecularly driven treatment with response rates of more than 80% in stable disease and partial remission. Classifying soft-tissue neoplasms by their molecular genetic pathology has been considered as molecular testing becomes more integrated into various diagnostic and prognostic algorithms.; CONCLUSIONS: Molecular pathology provides a unique opportunity for pathologists to play a crucial role in the multidisciplinary care of patients with sarcoma. These opportunities include but are not limited to the appropriate triage of tissue for molecular testing and the integration of molecular testing results, with histological and immunohistochemical findings providing actionable information for the diagnosis, prognosis, and choice of therapeutic modality.

AB Recent studies revealed that muscle-invasive bladder cancers segregate into intrinsic basal and luminal subtypes that are similar to those described for breast cancer. Each subtype is enriched with potentially clinically actionable genomic alterations and epigenetic signatures; there are associations between tumor subtype and sensitivity to conventional cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The authors review biological and clinical characteristics of the intrinsic subtypes and describe their implications for the development of conventional and targeted agents. The role that tumor plasticity seems to play in basal and luminal bladder cancer biology and its potential effects on the development of therapeutic resistance is also discussed.

AB CONTEXT: Intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) can impair the precise molecular analysis of tumours and may contribute to difficulties encountered in cancer biomarker qualification and treatment personalisation.; OBJECTIVE: This review summarises the evidence for genetic ITH in renal, bladder, and prostate carcinomas and potential strategies to address the clinical and translational research challenges arising from ITH.; EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Publications that assessed ITH in the relevant urologic cancers were identified in a literature review.; EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: ITH with functionally distinct tumour subclones has been identified in all three tumour types. Heterogeneity of actionable genetic changes and of prognostic biomarkers between different tumour regions in the same patient suggests limitations of single biopsy-based molecular analyses for precision medicine approaches. Evolutionary constraints may differ between patients and may allow the prediction of specific evolutionary trajectories.; CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of multiple tumour regions for precision medicine purposes, monitoring of subclonal dynamics over time, and the preferential targeting of genetic alterations located on the trunk of the phylogenetic tree of individual cancers may accelerate the development of personalised medicine strategies and improve our understanding of treatment failure.; PATIENT SUMMARY: Genetic alterations can be heterogeneous within urologic tumours, complicating their use as biomarkers for treatment personalisation. We present novel strategies to address these challenges. Copyright © 2014 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled genome-wide personalized oncology efforts at centers and companies with the specialty expertise and infrastructure required to identify and prioritize actionable variants. Such approaches are not scalable, preventing widespread adoption. Likewise, most targeted NGS approaches fail to assess key relevant genomic alteration classes. To address these challenges, we predefined the catalog of relevant solid tumor somatic genome variants (gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations, high-level copy number alterations, and gene fusions) through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of >700,000 samples. To detect these variants, we developed the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel (OCP), an integrative NGS-based assay [compatible with <20 ng of DNA/RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues], coupled with an informatics pipeline to specifically identify relevant predefined variants and created a knowledge base of related potential treatments, current practice guidelines, and open clinical trials. We validated OCP using molecular standards and more than 300 FFPE tumor samples, achieving >95% accuracy for KRAS, epidermal growth factor receptor, and BRAF mutation detection as well as for ALK and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions. Associating positive variants with potential targeted treatments demonstrated that 6% to 42% of profiled samples (depending on cancer type) harbored alterations beyond routine molecular testing that were associated with approved or guideline-referenced therapies. As a translational research tool, OCP identified adaptive CTNNB1 amplifications/mutations in treated prostate cancers. Through predefining somatic variants in solid tumors and compiling associated potential treatment strategies, OCP represents a simplified, broadly applicable targeted NGS system with the potential to advance precision oncology efforts.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the agreement in opinion between the elderly in care facilities and their family members regarding the life-sustaining treatment at the deathbed and to find out if the intentions of the elderly are being properly reflected in their deathbed treatment.; METHODS: Data were collected from 85 elderly individuals at five care facilities in Chunkcheongnam-do and 85 family members. The data were collected with a self-administered questionnaire from July 22, 2013 to August 15, 2014. A total of 170 cases were analyzed using SPSS version 21.; RESULTS: First, the family members' preference for life-sustaining treatment was higher than the patients' preference. The preference between the elderly and their family members regarding life-sustaining treatment was statistically significant with regards to oral nutrition, pain control through oral and anal administration, pain control through intravenous administration, transfusion, and admission to an intensive care unit. Second, looking at the agreement between elderly and guardians regarding life-sustaining treatment, there was significant concordance about general testing, oral nutrition, intravenous hydration, intravenous nutrition, antibiotic treatment for severe infection with low resiliency, admission to an intensive care unit, blood pressure increase medication use, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and tracheotomy.; CONCLUSION: It is essential for the medical staff to confirm agreement between the elderly and their family members regarding life-sustaining treatment, and if such a prior agreement is not feasible, the patient's intention should be considered more actionable than their family members.

AB Tuberculosis remains a major global public health challenge. Although incidence is decreasing, the proportion of drug-resistant cases is increasing. Technical and operational complexities prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility phenotyping in the vast majority of new and retreatment cases. The advent of molecular technologies provides an opportunity to obtain results rapidly as compared to phenotypic culture. However, correlations between genetic mutations and resistance to multiple drugs have not been systematically evaluated. Molecular testing of M. tuberculosis sampled from a typical patient continues to provide a partial picture of drug resistance. A database of phenotypic and genotypic testing results, especially where prospectively collected, could document statistically significant associations and may reveal new, predictive molecular patterns. We examine the feasibility of integrating existing molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility data to identify associations observed across multiple studies and demonstrate potential for well-integrated M. tuberculosis mutation data to reveal actionable findings.  © The Author 2014.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review and update the conceptual framework, indicator content and research priorities of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Health Care Quality Indicators (HCQI) project, after a decade of collaborative work.; DESIGN: A structured assessment was carried out using a modified Delphi approach, followed by a consensus meeting, to assess the suite of HCQI for international comparisons, agree on revisions to the original framework and set priorities for research and development.; SETTING: International group of countries participating to OECD projects.; PARTICIPANTS: Members of the OECD HCQI expert group.; RESULTS: A reference matrix, based on a revised performance framework, was used to map and assess all seventy HCQI routinely calculated by the OECD expert group. A total of 21 indicators were agreed to be excluded, due to the following concerns: (i) relevance, (ii) international comparability, particularly where heterogeneous coding practices might induce bias, (iii) feasibility, when the number of countries able to report was limited and the added value did not justify sustained effort and (iv) actionability, for indicators that were unlikely to improve on the basis of targeted policy interventions.; CONCLUSIONS: The revised OECD framework for HCQI represents a new milestone of a long-standing international collaboration among a group of countries committed to building common ground for performance measurement. The expert group believes that the continuation of this work is paramount to provide decision makers with a validated toolbox to directly act on quality improvement strategies. © The Author 2015.

AB UNLABELLED: Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors with variable clinical behavior accounting for a small subset of all breast neoplasms, yet little is known about the genetic alterations that drive tumor initiation and/or progression. Here, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify somatic alterations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient specimens from malignant, borderline, and benign cases. NGS revealed mutations in mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) affecting the G44 hotspot residue in the majority (67%) of cases spanning all three histologic grades. In addition, loss-of-function mutations in p53 (TP53) as well as deleterious mutations in the tumor suppressors retinoblastoma (RB1) and neurofibromin 1 (NF1) were identified exclusively in malignant tumors. High-level copy-number alterations (CNA) were nearly exclusively confined to malignant tumors, including potentially clinically actionable gene amplifications in IGF1R and EGFR. Taken together, this study defines the genomic landscape underlying phyllodes tumor development, suggests potential molecular correlates to histologic grade, expands the spectrum of human tumors with frequent recurrent MED12 mutations, and identifies IGF1R and EGFR as potential therapeutic targets in malignant cases.; IMPLICATIONS: Integrated genomic sequencing and mutational profiling provides insight into the molecular origin of phyllodes tumors and indicates potential druggable targets in malignant disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Traditional, hypothesis-oriented research approaches have thus far failed to generate sufficient evidence to achieve consensus about the management of children with many endocrine disorders, partly because of the rarity of these disorders and because of regulatory burdens unique to research in children.; OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Endocrine Society is launching a quality improvement network in spring 2015 for the management of pediatric endocrine disorders that are relatively uncommon in any single practice and/or for which there is no consensus on management.; DESIGN: The first of the quality improvement programs to be implemented seeks to improve the care of 11- to 17-year-old girls with Turner syndrome who require initiation of estrogen replacement therapy by providing a standardized clinical assessment and management plan (SCAMP) for transdermal estradiol treatment to induce pubertal development. The SCAMP algorithm represents a starting point within current best practice that is meant to undergo refinement through an iterative process of analysis of deidentified data collected in the course of clinical care by a network of pediatric endocrinologists.; CONCLUSION: It is anticipated that this program will not only improve care, but will also result in actionable data that will generate new research hypotheses and changes in management of pediatric endocrine disorders.

AB Department-wide retreats conducted at periods of transition can enrich and benefit academic departments in several ways. Here, the authors describe the organization, conduct, and immediate outcomes of a department-wide retreat in a university department of psychiatry intended to (1) foster networking and communication among faculty who often work in "silos" and (2) invite the faculty to provide "internal consultations" regarding aspirational strategic goals and recommendations for short-term actionable tactics to address these goals. The retreat featured an evening networking and socializing poster session followed by a day-long event consisting of small group and large group interactive sessions. Participants were 120 faculty members including 44 new and younger faculty members who prepared and presented posters about themselves and their work. A variety of aspirational goals and specific recommendations for follow-up emerged from small groups were discussed in plenary sessions and were subsequently summarized and distributed to the faculty to be addressed by ongoing workgroups. Immediate informal feedback suggests that conducting and acting on recommendations ensuing from academic department retreats can foster at least a short-term sense of shared community and purpose, network faculty, identify commonly held values and aspirational goals, and potentially stimulate formation of innovative affinity groups and collaborations. Longer-term workgroup efforts and outcome assessments are required to assess the enduring results and value of such undertakings.

AB We apply a social-ecological interpretive framework to understanding relationships among patient privacy, psychological health, social stigma, and continuity in care in the HIV treatment cascade in the rural southeastern US. This research was conducted as part of the 2013 comprehensive needs assessment for the Northeast Georgia Ryan White Consortium using an anthropologically informed mixed-methods design, and a deductive-inductive approach to thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained in interviews and focus groups with service providers and service utilizers. Our comprehensive needs assessment yielded two key components. First, we identified salient phenomena influencing introduction to, retention among, and satisfaction of patients in the Ryan White-coordinated treatment cascade in NE-GA. Second, we formulated actionable recommendations around leverage points identified in the current district-wide system of care. Results highlight spatial, institutional, and interpersonal aspects of the system of care that intersect around issues of patient privacy, psychological health, and social stigma. These intersections constitute pathways by which persons living with HIV are exposed to stigma and other negative social signals regarding their health status without sufficient access to behavioral health services. These negative issues, in turn, can erect significant barriers to long-term continuity in care.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB CONTEXT: Advances in molecular biomarkers of the gastrointestinal tract have contributed to a decline in the incidence of and mortality from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The discovery and clinical validation of new biomarkers are important to personalized cancer therapy, and numerous clinical trials are currently ongoing to help identify individualized therapy affecting these biomarkers and molecular mechanisms they represent. Distinct molecular pathways leading to cancers of the colorectum, esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and pancreas have been identified. Using biomarkers in these pathways to direct patient care, including selection of proper molecular testing for identification of actionable mutations and reporting the results of these biomarkers to guide clinicians and genetic counselors, is paramount.; OBJECTIVE: To examine and review select clinically actionable biomarkers of the colon, esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and pancreas, including present and future biomarkers with relevant clinical trials.; DATA SOURCES: Extensive literature review and practical and consultation experience of the authors.; CONCLUSIONS: Although numerous biomarkers have been identified and are currently guiding patient therapy, few have shown evidence of clinical utility in the management of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Inconsistent results and discordant proposed algorithms for testing were identified throughout the literature; however, the potential for biomarkers to improve outcomes for patients with gastrointestinal cancer remains high. Continued advances through high-quality studies are needed.

AB The Lung Master Protocol (Lung-MAP, S1400) is a groundbreaking clinical trial designed to advance the efficient development of targeted therapies for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. There are no approved targeted therapies specific to advanced lung SCC, although The Cancer Genome Atlas project and similar studies have detected a significant number of somatic gene mutations/amplifications in lung SCC, some of which are targetable by investigational agents. However, the frequency of these changes is low (5%-20%), making recruitment and study conduct challenging in the traditional clinical trial setting. Here, we describe our approach to development of a biomarker-driven phase II/II multisubstudy "Master Protocol," using a common platform (next-generation DNA sequencing) to identify actionable molecular abnormalities, followed by randomization to the relevant targeted therapy versus standard of care. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB With the proliferation of affordable large-scale human genomic data come profound and vexing questions about management of such data and their clinical uncertainty. These issues challenge the view that genomic research on human beings can (or should) be fully segregated from clinical genomics, either conceptually or practically. Here, we argue that the sharp distinction between clinical care and research is especially problematic in the context of large-scale genomic sequencing of people with suspected genetic conditions. Core goals of both enterprises (e.g. understanding genotype-phenotype relationships; generating an evidence base for genomic medicine) are more likely to be realized at a population scale if both those ordering and those undergoing sequencing for diagnostic reasons are routinely and longitudinally studied. Rather than relying on expensive and lengthy randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses, we propose leveraging nascent clinical-research hybrid frameworks into a broader, more permanent instantiation of exploratory medical sequencing. Such an investment could enlighten stakeholders about the real-life challenges posed by whole-genome sequencing, such as establishing the clinical actionability of genetic variants, returning 'off-target' results to families, developing effective service delivery models and monitoring long-term outcomes.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB Cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to enable non-invasive diagnostic tests for personalized medicine in providing similar molecular information as that derived from invasive tumor biopsies. The histology-independent phase II SHIVA trial matches patients with targeted therapeutics based on previous screening of multiple somatic mutations using metastatic biopsies. To evaluate the utility of ctDNA in this trial, as an ancillary study we performed de novo detection of somatic mutations using plasma DNA compared to metastasis biopsies in 34 patients covering 18 different tumor types, scanning 46 genes and more than 6800 COSMIC mutations with a multiplexed next-generation sequencing panel. In 27 patients, 28 of 29 mutations identified in metastasis biopsies (97%) were detected in matched ctDNA. Among these 27 patients, one additional mutation was found in ctDNA only. In the seven other patients, mutation detection from metastasis biopsy failed due to inadequate biopsy material, but was successful in all plasma DNA samples providing three more potential actionable mutations. These results suggest that ctDNA analysis is a potential alternative and/or replacement to analyses using costly, harmful and lengthy tissue biopsies of metastasis, irrespective of cancer type and metastatic site, for multiplexed mutation detection in selecting personalized therapies based on the patient's tumor genetic content.

AB OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).; PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.; ACTION STATEMENTS: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS. © American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2015.

AB Successful performance and execution of rapid diagnostics in a clinical laboratory hinges heavily on careful validation, accurate and timely communication of results, and real-time quality monitoring. Laboratories must develop strategies to integrate diagnostics with stewardship and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. We present a collaborative SUCCESS model for execution and monitoring of rapid sepsis diagnostics to facilitate timely treatment. Six months after execution of the Verigene Gram-Positive Blood Culture (BC-GP) and the AdvanDx PNA-FISH assays, data were collected on 579 and 28 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia, respectively. Clinical testing was executed using a SUCCESS model comprising the following components: stewardship, utilization of resources, core strategies, concierge services, education, support, and surveillance. Stewardship needs were identified by evaluating the specialty services benefiting from new testing. Utilization of resources was optimized by reviewing current treatment strategies and antibiogram and formulary options. Core strategies consisted of input from infectious disease leadership, pharmacy, and laboratory staff. Concierge services included automated Micro-eUpdate and physician-friendly actionable reports. Education modules were user-specific, and support was provided through a dedicated 24/7 microbiology hotline. Surveillance was performed by daily audit by the director. Using the SUCCESS model, the turnaround time for the detailed report with actionable guidelines to the physician was 3 hours from the time of culture positivity. The overall correlation between rapid methods and culture was 94% (546/579). Discrepant results were predominantly contaminants such as a coagulase-negative staphylococci or viridans streptococci in mixed cultures. SUCCESS is a cost-effective and easily adaptable model for clinical laboratories with limited stewardship resources.

AB Multiple mechanisms have been described that confer BRAF inhibitor resistance to melanomas, yet the basis of this resistance remains undefined in a sizable portion of patient samples. Here, we characterized samples from a set of patients with melanoma that included individuals at baseline diagnosis, on BRAF inhibitor treatment, and with resistant tumors at both the protein and RNA levels. Using RNA and DNA sequencing, we identified known resistance-conferring mutations in 50% (6 of 12) of the resistant samples. In parallel, targeted proteomic analysis by protein array categorized the resistant samples into 3 stable groups, 2 of which were characterized by reactivation of MAPK signaling to different levels and 1 that was MAPK independent. The molecular relevance of these classifications identified in patients was supported by both mutation data and the similarity of resistance patterns that emerged during a co-clinical trial in a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of melanoma that recapitulates the development of BRAF inhibitor resistance. Additionally, we defined candidate biomarkers in pre- and early-treatment patient samples that have potential for predicting clinical responses. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanomas can be actionably classified using protein expression patterns, even without identification of the underlying genetic alteration.

AB OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) are not optimized for chronic disease management. To improve the quality of care for patients with rheumatic disease, we developed electronic data capture, aggregation, display, and documentation software.; METHODS: The software integrated and reassembled information from the patient (via a touchscreen questionnaire), nurse, physician, and EHR into a series of actionable views. Core functions included trends over time, rheumatology-related demographics, and documentation for patient and provider. Quality measures collected included patient-reported outcomes, disease activity, and function. The software was tested and implemented in 3 rheumatology departments, and integrated into routine care delivery. Post-implementation evaluation measured adoption, efficiency, productivity, and patient perception.; RESULTS: Over 2 years, 6,725 patients completed 19,786 touchscreen questionnaires. The software was adopted for use by 86% of patients and rheumatologists. Chart review and documentation time trended downward, and productivity increased by 26%. Patient satisfaction, activation, and adherence remained unchanged, although pre-implementation values were high. A strong correlation was seen between use of the software and disease control (weighted Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.5927, P = 0.0095), and a relative increase in patients with low disease activity of 3% per quarter was noted.; CONCLUSION: We describe innovative software that aggregates, stores, and displays information vital to improving the quality of care for patients with chronic rheumatic disease. The software was well-adopted by patients and providers. Post-implementation, significant improvements in quality of care, efficiency of care, and productivity were demonstrated.

AB Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic services have generated enormous controversy from their first emergence. A dramatic recent manifestation of this is the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) cease and desist order against 23andMe, the leading provider in the market. Critics have argued for the restrictive regulation of such services, and even their prohibition, on the grounds of the harm they pose to consumers. Their advocates, by contrast, defend them as a means of enhancing the autonomy of those same consumers. Autonomy emerges as a key battle-field in this debate, because many of the 'harm' arguments can be interpreted as identifying threats to autonomy. This paper assesses whether DTC genomic services are a threat to, or instead, an enhancement of, personal autonomy. It deploys Joseph Raz's account of personal autonomy, with its emphasis on choice from a range of valuable options. It then seeks to counter claims that DTC genomics threatens autonomy because it involves manipulation in contravention of consumers' independence or because it does not generate valuable options which can be meaningfully engaged with by consumers. It is stressed that the value of the options generated by DTC genomics should not be judged exclusively from the perspective of medical actionability, but should take into consideration plural utilities. Finally, the paper ends by broaching policy recommendations, suggesting that there is a strong autonomy-based argument for permitting DTC genomic services, and that the key question is the nature of the regulatory conditions under which they should be permitted. The discussion of autonomy in this paper helps illuminate some of these conditions.  Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB Health systems in many African countries are failing to provide populations with access to good quality health care. Morbidity and mortality from curable diseases such as malaria remain high. The PRIME trial in Tororo, rural Uganda, designed and tested an intervention to improve care at health centres, with the aim of reducing ill-health due to malaria in surrounding communities. This paper presents the impact and context of this trial from the perspective of community members in the study area. Fieldwork was carried out for a year from the start of the intervention in June 2011, and involved informal observation and discussions as well as 13 focus group discussions with community members, 10 in-depth interviews with local stakeholders, and 162 context descriptions recorded through quarterly interviews with community members, health workers and district officials. Community members observed a small improvement in quality of care at most, but not all, intervention health centres. However, this was diluted by other shortfalls in health services beyond the scope of the intervention. Patients continued to seek care at health centres they considered inadequate as well as positioning themselves and their children to access care through other sources such as research and nongovernmental organization (NGO) projects. These findings point to challenges of designing and delivering interventions within a paradigm that requires factorial (reduced to predictable factors) problem definition with easily actionable and evaluable solutions by small-scale projects. Such requirements mean that interventions often work on the periphery of a health system rather than tackling the murky political and economic realities that shape access to care but are harder to change or evaluate with randomized controlled trials. Highly projectified settings further reduce the ability to genuinely 'control' for different health care access scenarios. We argue for a raised consciousness of how evaluation paradigms impact on intervention choices.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, there has been a paradigm shift toward an understanding of the need to screen select sub-populations for several sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections simultaneously, at one time with various rapid point-of-care (POC) technologies, rather than one infection at a time. This is an encouraging and promising change, however many contextual factors need to be considered before implementing such technologies. In this editorial, we highlight some challenges, issues and concerns regarding implementation, integration, and uptake of these technologies across global settings. However, careful planning and well thought out implementation plan that include investments in training health care professionals, improving test and treat algorithms, rapid protocols on communicating actionable results to providers, and timely action, will bring about the desired impact in patient's lives. This is especially true in settings where they stand to achieve the maximum desired public health and social impact.

AB Epigenetic processes, such as changes in DNA methylation, likely mediate the link between environmental exposures in utero and altered gene expression. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate imprinted genes may be especially vulnerable to environmental exposures since imprinting is established and maintained largely through DNA methylation, resulting in expression from only one parental chromosome. We used the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293, to investigate the effects of exposure to physiologically relevant doses of lead acetate (Pb) on the methylation status of nine imprinted gene DMRs. We assessed mean methylation after seventy-two hours of Pb exposure (0-25 mug/dL) using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The PEG1/MEST and IGF2 DMRs had maximum methylation decreases of 9.6% (20 mug/dL; p<0.005) and 3.8% (25 mug/dL; p<0.005), respectively. Changes at the MEG3 DMRs had a maximum decrease in methylation of 2.9% (MEG3) and 1.8% (MEG3-IG) at 5 mug/dL Pb, but were not statistically significant. The H19, NNAT, PEG3, PLAGL1, and SGCE/PEG10 DMRs showed a less than 0.5% change in methylation, across the dose range used, and were deemed non-responsive to Pb in our model. Pb exposure below reportable/actionable levels increased expression of PEG1/MEST concomitant with decreased methylation. These results suggest that Pb exposure can stably alter the regulatory capacity of multiple imprinted DMRs. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We sought to describe the spectrum of potential and confirmed germline genomic events incidentally identified during routine medium-throughput somatic tumor DNA sequencing, and to provide a framework for pre- and post-test consent and counseling for patients and families. Targeted tumor-only next-generation sequencing (NGS) had been used to evaluate for possible druggable genomic events obtained from consecutive new patients with metastatic gastroesophageal, hepatobiliary or colorectal cancer seen at the University of Chicago. A panel of medical oncologists, cancer geneticists and genetic counselors retrospectively grouped these patients (N=111) based on probability of possessing a potentially inherited mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene, both prior to and after incorporating tumor-only NGS results. High-risk patients (determined from NGS results) were contacted and counseled in person by a genetic counselor (N=21). When possible and indicated, germline genetic testing was offered. Of 8 evaluable high-risk patients, 7 underwent germline testing. Three (37.5%) had confirmed actionable germline mutations (all in the BRCA2 gene). NGS offers promise, but poses significant challenges for oncologists who are ill prepared to handle incidental findings that have clinical implications for at risk family members. In this relatively small cohort of patients undergoing tumor genomic testing for gastrointestinal malignancies, we incidentally identified 3 BRCA2 mutations carriers. This report underscores the need for oncologists to develop a framework for pre- and post-test communication of risks to patients undergoing routine tumor-only sequencing.  © 2014 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of social media data sources for a wide range of public health goals, including disease surveillance, mental health trends, and health perceptions and sentiment. Most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance.; OBJECTIVE: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable information about pollution levels and public response.; METHODS: We mined a collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to air quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior or a health concern.; RESULTS: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to .718 (n=74, P<.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1% (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior and 19% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be taken to improve quality.; CONCLUSIONS: We have found quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects. Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data, especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires expensive surveys or interviews.

AB BACKGROUND: July 2011 saw the implementation of the newest duty hour restrictions, further limiting the working hours of first year residents and necessitating a variety of adaptations on the part of residency programs. The present study sought to characterize the perceived impact of these restrictions on residency program personnel using a multi-specialty and multi-site approach.; METHODS: We developed and administered a survey to internal medicine and general surgery residency programs at three academic medical centers within an urban region. The survey combined quantitative and qualitative components to gain a broader understanding of the impact of the newest regulations. Quantitative responses were compared between Internal Medicine and General Surgery programs with Student t-tests. Other comparisons were performed using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis testing as appropriate. For all comparisons, the threshold for significance was set at 0.01. Two independent reviewers coded all qualitative data and assigned one or more themes based on content. Descriptive statistics were calculated and the diversity of themes identified. No between-group comparisons were conducted with the qualitative data.; RESULTS: We found significant differences in the overall perceptions of duty hour restrictions across specialty (internal medicine more positive than general surgery) and across position (first year residents more positive than senior residents and faculty). Notably, individuals who trained at osteopathic medical schools reported significantly more negative views of the duty hour restrictions than those who had trained at allopathic or international medical schools, suggesting an influence of undergraduate medical training. The complementary qualitative data offered insights into the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the duty hour restrictions, as well as actionable suggestions that could help to improve residency program function.; CONCLUSION: This study characterizes responses to the new duty hour restrictions from a variety of perspectives. Our findings show that individual (type of undergraduate medical education, role in graduate medical education) and program-wide (e.g., specialty) factors contribute to participant satisfaction with DHR. This research highlights the value of a mixed methods approach in the study of duty hour restrictions, with our qualitative arm yielding rich data that complemented and expanded upon the insights derived from the quantitative data.

AB We hypothesized that aberrations activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via dimerization would be more sensitive to anti-dimerization agents (e.g., cetuximab). EGFR exon 19 abnormalities (L747_A750del; deletes amino acids LREA) respond to reversible EGFR kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Exon 20 in-frame insertions and/or duplications (codons 767 to 774) and T790M mutations are clinically resistant to reversible/some irreversible TKIs. Their impact on protein function/therapeutic actionability are not fully elucidated.In our study, the index patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbored EGFR D770_P772del_insKG (exon 20). A twenty patient trial (NSCLC cohort) (cetuximab-based regimen) included two participants with EGFR TKI-resistant mutations ((i) exon 20 D770>GY; and (ii) exon 19 LREA plus exon 20 T790M mutations). Structural modeling predicted that EGFR exon 20 anomalies (D770_P772del_insKG and D770>GY), but not T790M mutations, stabilize the active dimer configuration by increasing the interaction between the kinase domains, hence sensitizing to an agent preventing dimerization. Consistent with predictions, the two patients harboring D770_P772del_insKG and D770>GY, respectively, responded to an EGFR antibody (cetuximab)-based regimen; the T790M-bearing patient showed no response to cetuximab combined with erlotinib. In silico modeling merits investigation of its ability to optimize therapeutic selection based on structural/functional implications of different aberrations within the same gene.

AB PURPOSE: We conducted a basket clinical trial to assess the feasibility of such a design strategy and to independently evaluate the effects of multiple targeted agents against specific molecular aberrations in multiple histologic subtypes concurrently.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, and thymic malignancies who underwent genomic characterization of oncogenic drivers. Patients were enrolled onto a not-otherwise-specified arm and treated with standard-of-care therapies or one of the following five biomarker-matched treatment groups: erlotinib for EGFR mutations; selumetinib for KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, or BRAF mutations; MK2206 for PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN mutations; lapatinib for ERBB2 mutations or amplifications; and sunitinib for KIT or PDGFRA mutations or amplification.; RESULTS: Six hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled, and 88% had their tumors tested for at least one gene. EGFR mutation frequency was 22.1% in NSCLC, and erlotinib achieved a response rate of 60% (95% CI, 32.3% to 83.7%). KRAS mutation frequency was 24.9% in NSCLC, and selumetinib failed to achieve its primary end point, with a response rate of 11% (95% CI, 0% to 48%). Completion of accrual to all other arms was not feasible. In NSCLC, patients with EGFR mutations had the longest median survival (3.51 years; 95% CI, 2.89 to 5.5 years), followed by those with ALK rearrangements (2.94 years; 95% CI, 1.66 to 4.61 years), those with KRAS mutations (2.3 years; 95% CI, 2.3 to 2.17 years), those with other genetic abnormalities (2.17 years; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.74 years), and those without an actionable mutation (1.85 years; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.13 years).; CONCLUSION: This basket trial design was not feasible for many of the arms with rare mutations, but it allowed the study of the genetics of less common malignancies. © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB As part of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Colorado has expanded Medicaid and also now operates its own health insurance exchange for individuals (called Connect for Health Colorado). As of early 2014, more than 300,000 Coloradans have newly enrolled in Medicaid or health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, but there also continues to be a diverse mix of individuals in Colorado who remain eligible for but not enrolled in either private insurance or Medicaid. The Colorado Health Foundation commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a study to better understand why these individuals are not enrolled in health insurance coverage and to develop recommendations for how Colorado can strengthen its outreach and enrollment efforts during the next open enrollment period, which starts in November 2014. RAND conducted focus groups with uninsured and newly insured individuals across the state and interviews with local stakeholders responsible for enrollment efforts in their regions. The authors identified 11 commonly cited barriers, as well as several that were specific to certain regions or populations (such as young adults and seasonal workers). Collectively, these barriers point to a set of four priority recommendations that stakeholders in Colorado may wish to consider: (1) Support and expand localized outreach and tailored messaging; (2) Strengthen marketing and messaging to be clear, focused on health benefits of insurance (rather than politics and mandates), and actionable; (3) Improve the clarity and transparency of insurance and health care costs and enrollment procedures; and (4) Revisit the two-stage enrollment process and improve Connect for Health Colorado website navigation and technical support.

AB To assess clinical utility of the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX Recurrence Score), we determined whether women with HER2(-)/ER+ pN1mi breast cancer with low (<18) Recurrence Scores results are given adjuvant chemotherapy in a lower proportion than those with high scores (≥31). This was a multicenter chart review of ≥18 year old women with pN1mi breast cancer, HER2(-)/ER+ tumors, ductal/lobular/mixed histology, with the assay ordered on or after 1 January 2007. One hundred and eighty one patients had a mean age of 60.7 years; 82.9% had ECOG performance status 0; 33.7% had hypertension, 22.7% had osteoporosis, 18.8% had osteoarthritis, and 8.8% had type-2 diabetes. Mean Recurrence Score was 17.8 (range: 0-50). 48.6% had a mastectomy; 55.8% had a lumpectomy. 19.8% of low-risk group patients were recommended chemotherapy vs. 57.9% in the intermediate-risk group and 100% in the high-risk group (p < 0.001). A total of 80.2% of the low-risk group were recommended endocrine therapy alone, while 77.8% of the high-risk group were recommended both endocrine and chemotherapy (p < 0.001). The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score result provides actionable information that can be incorporated into treatment planning for women with HER2(-)/ER+ pN1mi breast cancer. The Recurrence Score result has clinical utility in treatment planning for HER2(-)/ER+ pN1mi breast cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICUs) are complex work environments where false alarms occur more frequently than on non-critical care units. The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal .06.01.01 targeted improving the safety of clinical alarm systems and required health care facilities to establish alarm systems safety as a hospital priority by July 2014. An important initial step toward this requirement is identifying ICU nurses' perceptions and common clinical practices toward clinical alarms, where little information is available.; OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine perceptions and practices of transplant/cardiac ICU (TCICU) nurses toward clinical alarms and benchmark the results against the 2011 Healthcare Technology Foundation's (HTF) Clinical Alarms Committee Survey.; METHODS: A quality improvement project was conducted on a 20-bed TCICU with 39 full- and part-time nurses. Nurses were surveyed about their perceptions and attitudes toward and practices on clinical alarms using an adapted HTF clinical alarms survey. Results were compared to the 2011 HTF data. Correlations among variables were examined.; RESULTS: All TCICU nurses provided usable responses (N=39, 100%). Almost all nurses (95%-98%) believed that false alarms are frequent, disrupt care, and reduce trust in alarm systems, causing nurses to inappropriately disable them. Unlike the 2011 HTF clinical alarms survey results, a significantly higher percentage of our TCICU nurses believed that existing devices are complex, questioned the ability and adequacy of the new monitoring systems to solve alarm management issues, pointed to the lack of prompt response to alarms, and indicated the lack of clinical policy on alarm management (P<.01). Major themes in the narrative data focused on nurses' frustration related to the excessive number of alarms and poor usability of the cardiac monitors. A lack of standardized approaches exists in changing patients' electrodes and individualizing parameters. Around 60% of nurses indicated they received insufficient training on bedside and central cardiac monitors. A correlation also showed the need for training on cardiac monitors, specifically for older nurses (P=.01).; CONCLUSIONS: False and non-actionable alarms continue to desensitize TCICU nurses, perhaps resulting in missing fatal alarms. Nurses' attitudes and practices related to clinical alarms are key elements for designing contextually sensitive quality initiatives to fight alarm fatigue. Alarm management in ICUs is a multidimensional complex process involving usability of monitoring devices, and unit, clinicians, training, and policy-related factors. This indicates the need for a multi-method approach to decrease alarm fatigue and improve alarm systems safety.

AB In 2013, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute assembled a working group on epidemiology and population sciences from its Advisory Council and Board of External Experts. The working group was charged with making recommendations to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council about how the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute could take advantage of new scientific opportunities and delineate future directions for the epidemiology of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases. Seven actionable recommendations were proposed for consideration. The themes included 1) defining the compelling scientific questions and challenges in population sciences and epidemiology of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases; 2) developing methods and training mechanisms to integrate "big data" science into the practice of epidemiology; 3) creating a cohort consortium and inventory of major studies to optimize the efficient use of data and specimens; and 4) fostering a more open, competitive approach to evaluating large-scale longitudinal epidemiology and population studies. By building on the track record of success of the heart, lung, blood, and sleep cohorts to leverage new data science opportunities and encourage broad research and training partnerships, these recommendations lay a strong foundation for the transformation of heart, lung, blood, and sleep epidemiology.  © The Author 2015.

AB Aging is the major determinant of cancer incidence, which, in turn, is likely dictated in large part by processes that influence the progression of early subclinical (occult) cancers. However, there is little understanding of how aging informs changes in aggregate host signaling that favor cancer progression. In this study, we provide direct evidence that aging can serve as an organizing axis to define cancer progression-modulating processes. As a model system to explore this concept, we employed adolescent (68 days), young adult (143 days), middle-aged (551 days), and old (736 days) C57BL/6 mice as syngeneic hosts for engraftment of Lewis lung cancer to identify signaling and functional processes varying with host age. Older hosts exhibited dysregulated angiogenesis, metabolism, and apoptosis, all of which are associated with cancer progression. TGFbeta1, a central player in these systemic processes, was downregulated consistently in older hosts. Our findings directly supported the conclusion of a strong host age dependence in determining the host tumor control dynamic. Furthermore, our results offer initial mechanism-based insights into how aging modulates tumor progression in ways that may be actionable for therapy or prevention. ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: It is a recognized child right to acquire a name and a nationality, and birth registration may be necessary to allow access to services, but the level of birth registration is low in Nigeria. A household survey about management of childhood illnesses provided an opportunity to examine actionable determinants of birth registration of children in Bauchi and Cross River states of Nigeria.; METHODS: Trained field teams visited households in a stratified random cluster sample of 90 enumeration areas in each state. They administered a questionnaire to women 14-49 years old which included questions about birth registration of their children 0-47 months old and about socio-economic and other factors potentially related to birth registration, including education of the parents, poverty (food sufficiency), marital status of the mother, maternal antenatal care and place of delivery of the last pregnancy. Bivariate then multivariate analysis examined associations with birth registration. Facilitators later conducted separate male and female focus group discussions in the same 90 communities in each state, discussing the reasons for the findings about levels of birth registration.; RESULTS: Nearly half (45%) of 8602 children in Cross River State and only a fifth (19%) of 9837 in Bauchi State had birth certificates (seen or unseen). In both states, children whose mothers attended antenatal care and who delivered in a government health facility in their last pregnancy were more likely to have a birth certificate, as were children of more educated parents, from less poor households, and from urban communities. Focus group discussions revealed that many people did not know about birth certificates or where to get them, and parents were discouraged from getting birth certificates because of the unofficial payments involved.; CONCLUSION: There are low levels of birth registration in Bauchi and Cross River states, particularly among disadvantaged households. As a result of this study, both states have planned interventions to increase birth registration, including closer collaboration between the National Population Commissions and state health services.

AB Small-molecule synthesis usually relies on procedures that are highly customized for each target. A broadly applicable automated process could greatly increase the accessibility of this class of compounds to enable investigations of their practical potential. Here we report the synthesis of 14 distinct classes of small molecules using the same fully automated process. This was achieved by strategically expanding the scope of a building block-based synthesis platform to include even C(sp3)-rich polycyclic natural product frameworks and discovering a catch-and-release chromatographic purification protocol applicable to all of the corresponding intermediates. With thousands of compatible building blocks already commercially available, many small molecules are now accessible with this platform. More broadly, these findings illuminate an actionable roadmap to a more general and automated approach for small-molecule synthesis.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence-based public health requires that research provides policymakers with reliable and accessible information reflecting the disease threats. We described the scientific production of research in Cambodia and assessed to what extent it provides appropriate insights and implications for practice to guide health policymakers and managers and knowledge relevant for translation.; METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of scientific articles published on biomedical research in Cambodia. Regression analysis assessed the trends over time and factors associated with actionable messages in the articles' abstracts.; RESULTS: From 2000 to 2012, 628 articles were published in 237 journals with a significant increase over time (from 0.6/million population to 5.9/million population, slope coefficient 7.6, 95% CI 6.5-8.7, p<0.001). Most publications on diseases addressed communicable diseases (n=410, 65.3%). Non-communicable diseases (NCD) were under-addressed (7.7% of all publications) considering their burden (34.5% of the disease burden). Of all articles, 67.8% reported descriptive studies and 4.3% reported studies with a high level of evidence; 27.4% of studies were led by an institution based in Cambodia. Factors associated with an actionable message (n=73, 26.6%) were maternal health (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.55-6.13, p=0.001), the first author's institution being Cambodian (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06-2.98, p=0.02) and a free access to full article (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.08-8.70, p=0.03). Of all articles, 87% (n=546) were accessible in full text from Cambodia.; CONCLUSIONS: Scientific publications do not fully match with health priorities. Gaps remain regarding NCD, implementation studies, and health system research. A health research agenda would help align research with health priorities. We recommend 1) that the health authorities create an online repository of research findings with abstracts in the local language; 2) that academics emphasize the importance of research in their university teaching; and 3) that the researcher teams involve local researchers and that they systematically provide a translation of their abstracts upon submission to a journal. We conclude that building the bridge between research and public health requires a willful, comprehensive strategy rather than relying solely only publications.

AB With the quick development of RFID technology and the decreasing prices of RFID devices, RFID is becoming widely used in various intelligent services. Especially in the retail application domain, RFID is increasingly adopted to capture the shopping tracks and behavior of in-store customers. To further enhance the potential of this promising application, in this paper, we propose a unified framework for RFID-based path analytics, which uses both in-store shopping paths and RFID-based purchasing data to mine actionable navigation patterns. Four modules of this framework are discussed, which are: (1) mapping from the physical space to the cyber space, (2) data preprocessing, (3) pattern mining and (4) knowledge understanding and utilization. In the data preprocessing module, the critical problem of how to capture the mainstream shopping path sequences while wiping out unnecessary redundant and repeated details is addressed in detail. To solve this problem, two types of redundant patterns, i.e., loop repeat pattern and palindrome-contained pattern are recognized and the corresponding processing algorithms are proposed. The experimental results show that the redundant pattern filtering functions are effective and scalable.

AB BACKGROUND: Physicians in training are at high risk for depression, and physicians in practice have a substantially elevated risk of suicide compared to the general population. The graduate medical education community is currently mobilizing efforts to improve resident wellness.; OBJECTIVE: We sought to provide a trainee perspective on current resources to support resident wellness and resources that need to be developed to ensure an optimal learning environment.; METHODS: The ACGME Council of Review Committee Residents, a 29-member multispecialty group of residents and fellows, conducted an appreciative inquiry exercise to (1) identify existing resources to address resident wellness; (2) envision the ideal learning environment to promote wellness; and (3) determine how the existing infrastructure could be modified to approach the ideal. The information was aggregated to identify consensus themes from group discussion.; RESULTS: National policy on resident wellness should (1) increase awareness of the stress of residency and destigmatize depression in trainees; (2) develop systems to identify and treat depression in trainees in a confidential way to reduce barriers to accessing help; (3) enhance mentoring by senior peers and faculty; (4) promote a supportive culture; and (5) encourage additional study of the problem to deepen our understanding of the issue.; CONCLUSIONS: A multispecialty, national panel of trainees identified actionable goals to broaden efforts in programs and sponsoring institutions to promote resident wellness and mental health awareness. Engagement of all stakeholders within the graduate medical education community will be critical to developing a comprehensive solution to this important issue.

AB Intra-tumor heterogeneity, variation between individual tumor cells within a patient's tumor, is increasingly seen as a critical mechanism underlying treatment resistance and therapeutic failure. Despite this growing awareness, few methods to assess intra-tumor heterogeneity exist outside the research laboratory, especially in the absence of a known marker. Mutant allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) is a novel, non-biased, quantitative method to assess genetic heterogeneity based on tumor next generation exome sequencing. The quantitative aspect of MATH has allowed it to be verified as an actionable biomarker in a retrospective HNSCC data set with available exome sequencing and clinical data. In addition, it was also capable of stratifying patient outcome after controlling for other high-risk features such as p53 mutation, HPV status, and advanced tumor stage. Future work will explore the predictive power of MATH in larger data sets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas and examine the underlying cellular mechanisms responsible for intra-tumor heterogeneity.

AB INTRODUCTION: Adverse events in the intensive care unit (ICU) may be associated with several possible causes, so determining a drug-related causal assessment is more challenging than in general ward patients. Therefore, the hypothesis was that automated trigger alerts may perform differently in various patient care settings. The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency and type of clinically significant automated trigger alerts in critically ill and general ward patients as well as evaluate the performance of alerts for drug-related hazardous conditions (DRHCs).; METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adult ICU and general ward patients at three institutions (academic, community, and rural hospital) in a health system. Automated trigger alerts generated during two nonconsecutive months were obtained from a centralized database. Pharmacist responses to alerts and prescriber response to recommendations were evaluated for all alerts. A clinical significant event was defined as an actionable intervention requiring drug therapy changes that the pharmacist determined to be appropriate for patient safety and where the physician accepted the pharmacist's recommendation. The positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated for each trigger alert considered a DRHC (i.e., abnormal laboratory values and suspected drug causes).; RESULTS: A total of 751 alerts were generated in 623 patients during the study period. Pharmacists intervened on 39.8 and 44.8 % alerts generated in the ICU and general ward, respectively. Overall, the physician acceptance rate of approximately 90 % was comparable irrespective of patient care setting. Therefore, the number of clinically significant alerts was 88.9 and 83.4 % for the ICU and non-ICU, respectively. The types of drug therapy changes were similar between settings. The PPV of alerts identifying a DRHC was 0.66 in the ICU and 0.76 in general ward patients.; CONCLUSIONS: The number and type of clinically significant alerts were similar irrespective of patient population, suggesting that the alerts may be equally as beneficial in the ICU population, despite the challenges in drug-related event adjudication. An opportunity exists to improve the performance of alerts in both settings, so quality improvement programs for measuring alert performance and making refinements is needed.

AB OBJECTIVES: To evaluate variability in health literacy outcomes due to home visiting (HV) program components including PHN, Intervention, and Client.; DESIGN AND SAMPLE: A comparative, correlational study evaluated PHN home visiting program data that included PHNs (N=16); Interventions (N=21,634); and Clients (N=141). Client age ranged from 14 to 46 (median=21, mean=22.8, SD=6.65). Clients were predominately White (75.9%), not married (84.4%), and female (99.3%). PHNS documented care using electronic health records (EHR) and the Omaha System.; MEASURES: The outcome of interest was health literacy benchmark attainment (adequate knowledge) operationalized by Omaha System Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes Knowledge scores averaged across problems.; INTERVENTION: Program of individually tailored, evidence-based HV interventions provided by PHNs.; RESULTS: There were 233 different interventions for 22 problems. Knowledge benchmark was attained by 16.3% of clients. Four factors explained variance in reaching the knowledge benchmark: Client (51%), Problem (17%), Intervention (16%), and PHN (16%).; CONCLUSIONS: The PHN and intervention tailoring are actionable components of HV programs that explain variability in health literacy outcomes. Further research should examine effects of training on PHN relationship skills and intervention tailoring to optimize outcomes of evidence-based PHN HV programs, and to evaluate whether improving health literacy may subsequently improve client problems. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Acquired brain injury is a critical public health and socioeconomic problem in Canada, leaving many patients in vegetative, minimally conscious, or locked-in states, unresponsive and unable to communicate. Recent advances in neuroimaging research have demonstrated residual consciousness in a few exemplary patients with acquired brain injury, suggesting potential misdiagnosis and changes in prognosis. Such progress, in parallel with research using multimodal brain imaging technologies in recent years, has promising implications for clinical translation, notwithstanding the many challenges that impact health care and policy development. This study explored the perspectives of Canadian professionals with expertise either in neuroimaging research, disorders of consciousness, or both, on the potential clinical applications and implications of imaging technology.; METHODS: Twenty-two professionals from designated communities of neuroimaging researchers, ethicists, lawyers, and practitioners participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed for emergent themes.; RESULTS: The five most dominant themes were: (1) validation and calibration of the methods; (2) informed consent; (3) burdens on the health care system; (4) implications for the Canadian health care system; and (5) possibilities for improved prognosis.; CONCLUSIONS: Movement of neuroimaging from research into clinical care for acquired brain injury will require careful consideration of legal and ethical issues alongside research reliability, responsible distribution of health care resources, and the interaction of technological capabilities with patient outcome.

AB Limited patient literacy contributes to poorer health status, increased emergency room and hospital use, higher morbidity and mortality rates, and less use of preventive health services. All patients, however, need health information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable to make informed decisions about their health. A universal health literacy precautions approach is recommended to empower patients through shared decision-making interactions. Consistent use of evidence-based health literacy practices by front-line nurses offers the potential for transformations in nursing care through stronger patient-nurse interactions and health system partnerships.

AB BACKGROUND: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays are increasingly used in personalized medicine programs to identify gene copy number aberrations (CNAs) that may be used to guide clinical decisions made during molecular tumor boards. However, analytical processes such as the centralization step may profoundly affect CGH array results and therefore may adversely affect outcomes in the precision medicine context.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effect of three different centralization methods: median, maximum peak, alternative peak, were evaluated on three datasets: (i) the NCI60 cell lines panel, (ii) the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) panel, and (iii) the patients enrolled in prospective molecular screening trials (SAFIR-01 n = 283, MOSCATO-01 n = 309), and compared with karyotyping, drug sensitivity, and patient-drug matching, respectively.; RESULTS: Using the NCI60 cell lines panel, the profiles generated by the alternative peak method were significantly closer to the cell karyotypes than those generated by the other centralization strategies (P < 0.05). Using the CCLE dataset, selected genes (ERBB2, EGFR) were better or equally correlated to the IC50 of their companion drug (lapatinib, erlotinib), when applying the alternative centralization. Finally, focusing on 24 actionable genes, we observed as many as 7.1% (SAFIR-01) and 6.8% (MOSCATO-01) of patients originally not oriented to a specific treatment, but who could have been proposed a treatment based on the alternative peak centralization method.; CONCLUSION: The centralization method substantially affects the call detection of CGH profiles and may thus impact precision medicine approaches. Among the three methods described, the alternative peak method addresses limitations associated with existing approaches. © The Author 2014.

AB BACKGROUND: Further advances of targeted cancer therapy require comprehensive in-depth profiling of somatic mutations that are present in subpopulations of tumor cells in a clinical tumor sample. However, it is unclear to what extent such intratumor heterogeneity is present and whether it may affect clinical decision-making. To study this question, we established a deep targeted sequencing platform to identify potentially actionable DNA alterations in tumor samples.; METHODS: We assayed 515 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples and matched germline DNA (475 patients) from 11 disease sites by capturing and sequencing all the exons in 201 cancer-related genes. Mutations, indels, and copy number data were reported.; RESULTS: We obtained a 1000-fold mean sequencing depth and identified 4794 nonsynonymous mutations in the samples analyzed, of which 15.2% were present at <10% allele frequency. Most of these low level mutations occurred at known oncogenic hotspots and are likely functional. Identifying low level mutations improved identification of mutations in actionable genes in 118 (24.84%) patients, among which 47 (9.8%) otherwise would have been unactionable. In addition, acquiring ultrahigh depth also ensured a low false discovery rate (<2.2%) from FFPE samples.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results were as accurate as a commercially available CLIA-compliant hotspot panel but allowed the detection of a higher number of mutations in actionable genes. Our study reveals the critical importance of acquiring and utilizing high sequencing depth in profiling clinical tumor samples and presents a very useful platform for implementing routine sequencing in a cancer care institution. © 2014 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB BACKGROUND: Prognostic impact of procedure-related bleeding in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains incompletely investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between peri-PCI bleeding and 1-year outcome of patients with stable CAD.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 9035 patients with stable CAD who underwent elective PCI. Bleeding within 30 days of PCI was defined using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria. The primary outcome was 1-year mortality.; RESULTS: Bleeding occurred in 844 patients (9.3%). Actionable bleeding (BARC class ≥ 2) occurred in 442 patients (4.9%). There were 210 deaths (2.3%) at 1 year following PCI: 41 deaths among patients with bleeding and 169 deaths among patients without bleeding [Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality, 4.9% and 2.1%; odds ratio = 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73-3.36, P < 0.001]. The association between bleeding and mortality remained significant after adjustment for baseline risk variables (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.87, 95% CI 1.27-2.76, P = 0.002). Bleeding increased the discriminatory power of the model regarding prediction of 1-year mortality (absolute and relative integrated discrimination improvement, 0.006% and 16.3%, respectively, P = 0.001).; CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable CAD undergoing elective PCI, the occurrence of bleeding within 30 days of the procedure was associated with increased risk of death at 1 year after PCI. These findings suggest that procedure-related bleeding may contribute to less than optimal results of PCI in terms of mortality reduction in patients with stable CAD. © 2015 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

AB Recommendations for laboratories to report incidental findings from genomic tests have stimulated interest in such results. In order to investigate the criteria and processes for assigning the pathogenicity of specific variants and to estimate the frequency of such incidental findings in patients of European and African ancestry, we classified potentially actionable pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in all 4300 European- and 2203 African-ancestry participants sequenced by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). We considered 112 gene-disease pairs selected by an expert panel as associated with medically actionable genetic disorders that may be undiagnosed in adults. The resulting classifications were compared to classifications from other clinical and research genetic testing laboratories, as well as with in silico pathogenicity scores. Among European-ancestry participants, 30 of 4300 (0.7%) had a pathogenic SNV and six (0.1%) had a disruptive variant that was expected to be pathogenic, whereas 52 (1.2%) had likely pathogenic SNVs. For African-ancestry participants, six of 2203 (0.3%) had a pathogenic SNV and six (0.3%) had an expected pathogenic disruptive variant, whereas 13 (0.6%) had likely pathogenic SNVs. Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling mammalian conservation score and the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion summary score of conservation, substitution, regulation, and other evidence were compared across pathogenicity assignments and appear to have utility in variant classification. This work provides a refined estimate of the burden of adult onset, medically actionable incidental findings expected from exome sequencing, highlights challenges in variant classification, and demonstrates the need for a better curated variant interpretation knowledge base.  © 2015 Amendola et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB OBJECTIVE: Significant reductions in gynecologic (GYN) cancer mortality and morbidity require treatments that prevent and reverse resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. The objective of this study was to determine if pharmacologic inhibition of key DNA damage response kinases in GYN cancers would enhance cell killing by platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation.; METHODS: A panel of human ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancer cell lines were treated with platinum drugs or ionizing radiation (IR) along with small molecule pharmacological kinase inhibitors of Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad-3-related (ATR).; RESULTS: Pharmacologic inhibition of ATR significantly enhanced platinum drug response in all GYN cancer cell lines tested, whereas inhibition of ATM did not enhance the response to platinum drugs. Co-inhibition of ATM and ATR did not enhance platinum kill beyond that observed by inhibition of ATR alone. By contrast, inhibiting either ATR or ATM enhanced the response to IR in all GYN cancer cells, with further enhancement achieved with co-inhibition.; CONCLUSIONS: These studies highlight actionable mechanisms operative in GYN cancer cells with potential to maximize response of platinum agents and radiation in newly diagnosed as well as recurrent gynecologic cancers.

AB Malaria parasites are continually evolving to evade the immune system and human attempts to control the disease. To eliminate malaria from regions where it is deeply entrenched we need ways of monitoring what is going on in the parasite population, detecting problematic changes as soon as they arise, and executing a prompt and effective response based on a deep understanding of this natural evolutionary process. Powerful new tools to address this problem are emerging from the fast-growing field of genomic epidemiology, driven by new sequencing technologies and computational methods that allow parasite genome variation to be studied in much greater detail and in many more samples than was previously considered possible. These new tools will provide a deep understanding of what is going on in the parasite population, generating actionable knowledge for strategic planning of control interventions, for monitoring their effects and steering them for greatest impact, and for raising the alert if things start to go wrong.  © The Author 2015.

The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) is currently considering several rural retention strategies to motivate qualified health personnel to practice in remote rural areas.; METHODS: To better calibrate these mechanisms and to develop evidence-based retention strategies that are attractive and motivating to health workers, a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted to examine what job attributes are most attractive and important to health workers when considering postings in remote areas. The study was carried out between July and August 2012 among 351 medical students, nursing students and health workers in Cameroon. Mixed logit models were used to analyze the data.; RESULTS: Among medical and nursing students a rural retention bonus of 75% of base salary (aOR= 8.27, 95% CI: 5.28-12.96, P< 0.001) and improved health facility infrastructure (aOR= 3.54, 95% CI: 2.73-4.58) respectively were the attributes with the largest effect sizes. Among medical doctors and nurse aides, a rural retention bonus of 75% of base salary was the attribute with the largest effect size (medical doctors aOR= 5.60, 95% CI: 4.12-7.61, P< 0.001; nurse aides aOR= 4.29, 95% CI: 3.11-5.93, P< 0.001). On the other hand, improved health facility infrastructure (aOR= 3.56, 95% CI: 2.75-4.60, P< 0.001), was the attribute with the largest effect size among the state registered nurses surveyed. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) estimates were generated for each health worker cadre for all the attributes. Preference impact measurements were also estimated to identify combination of incentives that health workers would find most attractive.; CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, the study recommends the introduction of a system of substantial monetary bonuses for rural service along with ensuring adequate and functional equipment and uninterrupted supplies. By focusing on the analysis of locally relevant, actionable incentives, generated through the involvement of policy-makers at the design stage, this study provides an example of research directly linked to policy action to address a vitally important issue in global health.

AB This perspective article will discuss the potential role of body-worn movement monitors for balance and gait assessment and treatment in rehabilitation. Recent advances in inexpensive, wireless sensor technology and smart devices are resulting in an explosion of miniature, portable sensors that can quickly and accurately quantify body motion. Practical and useful movement monitoring systems are now becoming available. It is critical that therapists understand the potential advantages and limitations of such emerging technology. One important advantage of obtaining objective measures of balance and gait from body-worn sensors is impairment-level metrics characterizing how and why functional performance of balance and gait activities are impaired. Therapy can then be focused on the specific physiological reasons for difficulty in walking or balancing during specific tasks. A second advantage of using technology to measure balance and gait behavior is the increased sensitivity of the balance and gait measures to document mild disability and change with rehabilitation. A third advantage of measuring movement, such as postural sway and gait characteristics, with body-worn sensors is the opportunity for immediate biofeedback provided to patients that can focus attention and enhance performance. In the future, body-worn sensors may allow therapists to perform telerehabilitation to monitor compliance with home exercise programs and the quality of their natural mobility in the community. Therapists need technological systems that are quick to use and provide actionable information and useful reports for their patients and referring physicians. Therapists should look for systems that provide measures that have been validated with respect to gold standard accuracy and to clinically relevant outcomes such as fall risk and severity of disability.  © 2015 American Physical Therapy Association.

AB OBJECTIVES: Although the prevalence of tobacco use among individuals with substance use disorders remains high, smoking cessation (SC) has not been a focus of addiction treatment programs. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policy requires tobacco use screening and the availability of evidence-based SC treatment in specialty care settings, including substance use disorder programs. As part of a larger quality improvement effort, this qualitative study examined how SC treatment is delivered in VHA substance use disorder residential treatment programs (SRTPs) and the barriers and opportunities for growth that exist within these settings.; METHODS: Twenty-five staff were interviewed across a sample of 15 SRTPs. Participants were asked to describe their knowledge and attitudes about SC treatment as well as organizational barriers and facilitators related to implementation of SC treatment in their programs. Content analysis was used to extract responses within and across programs.; RESULTS: Participants endorsed SC as a general goal and reported that SRTPs responded to patients who requested help. However, many programs did not emphasize SC as an important part of recovery from substance use disorders and did not document, reevaluate, or consistently address tobacco use.; CONCLUSIONS: The results identified critical gaps in the provision of SC treatment in VHA SRTPs. These findings suggest actionable opportunities to improve SC treatment in SRTPs, including providing training opportunities, developing or enforcing policies that support SC, implementing systems to track and report tobacco-related diagnoses and treatment, and obtaining leadership support for building a culture that encourages SC.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression (RD) is a significant cause of death and brain damage in the perioperative period. The authors examined anesthesia closed malpractice claims associated with RD to determine whether patterns of injuries could guide preventative strategies.; METHODS: From the Anesthesia Closed Claims Project database of 9,799 claims, three authors reviewed 357 acute pain claims that occurred between 1990 and 2009 for the likelihood of RD using literature-based criteria. Previously cited patient risk factors for RD, clinical management, nursing assessments, and timing of events were abstracted from claim narratives to identify recurrent patterns.; RESULTS: RD was judged as possible, probable, or definite in 92 claims (kappa = 0.690) of which 77% resulted in severe brain damage or death. The vast majority of RD events (88%) occurred within 24 h of surgery, and 97% were judged as preventable with better monitoring and response. Contributing and potentially actionable factors included multiple prescribers (33%), concurrent administration of nonopioid sedating medications (34%), and inadequate nursing assessments or response (31%). The time between the last nursing check and the discovery of a patient with RD was within 2 h in 42% and within 15 min in 16% of claims. Somnolence was noted in 62% of patients before the event.; CONCLUSIONS: This claims review supports a growing consensus that opioid-related adverse events are multifactorial and potentially preventable with improvements in assessment of sedation level, monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation, and early response and intervention, particularly within the first 24 h postoperatively.

AB INTRODUCTION: The management of advanced NSCLC has been shifted by histology-driven treatment and molecularly targeted therapy, especially in lung adenocarcinoma. However, as the second most common histology in NSCLC, the treatment options for squamous cell lung cancer (SQCLC) remain very limited.; AREAS COVERED: The review first discusses the role of histology in management of NSCLC and new cytotoxic agents in SQCLC, and then addresses genomic characterization and potential molecular targets in SQCLC. The article then provides an overview for several major categories of novel molecularly targeted therapies and immune-based strategies with particular attention to ongoing SQCLC trials.; EXPERT OPINION: The key challenges in drug development are to uncover novel actionable targets and to identify predictive biomarkers. Progress in genomic analysis has identified some promising targetable genes and oncogenic pathways in SQCLC with a wave of targeted agents being tested in clinical trials. Immunotherapy has also raised great interest in management of SQCLC, especially agents targeting immune check points, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, programmed death-1 receptor and its ligands. Better understanding of tumor biology and development of novel targeted therapies will help to facilitate more effective personalized therapy for patients with this devastating illness.

AB Dignity and independence are widely considered as core concepts to aging well, yet little research has explored how older adults perceive these issues in the context of community life. Moreover, little is known regarding the ways in which the broader public views and enhances aging with dignity and independence with their older residents. Using participatory action research, multiple methods of qualitative inquiry, and tenets of appreciative inquiry, this article reports on a community-based initiative aimed to better understand the positive aspects of aging with dignity and independence. Synthesized findings yielded 6 "actionable themes": (1) meaningful involvement, (2) aging in place, (3) respect and inclusion, (4) communication and information, (5) transportation and mobility, and (6) health and well-being. The findings invoke a new paradigm for community aging that highlights the unique contributions of older adults as a core social resource. Implications for mobilizing community action to promote aging with dignity and independence are discussed.  © The Author(s) 2012.

AB Somatic serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a tumor suppressor gene and ranks as the third most frequently mutated gene in lung adenocarcinoma. However, current molecular testing guidelines recommend evaluating for epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and ALK fusions to guide therapy in all patients with advanced stage adenocarcinoma, regardless of gender, race, or smoking history. Identifying alternative "driver" mutations and using actionable targeted pharmacotherapy is a key approach to providing effective individualized medical care. The analytical sensitivity and parallel multigene approach of targeted next-generation sequencing is an attractive methodology for use for cytology specimens. The presented lung adenocarcinoma study revealed that STK11 mutations alone and concomitant KRAS/STK11 mutations were identified in 18.2% and 4.5% of solitary adrenal metastases, respectively. Molecular profiling of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant tumors may help to identify patients who would most benefit from alternative single or dual pathway inhibition potentially leading to a revision in current molecular testing guidelines.

AB Clustering of obesity, coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular disease risk factors is observed in epidemiological studies and clinical settings. Twin and family studies have provided some supporting evidence for the clustering hypothesis. Loci nearest a lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showing genome-wide significant associations with coronary artery disease, body mass index, C-reactive protein, blood pressure, lipids, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were selected for pathway and network analyses. Eighty-seven autosomal regions (181 SNPs), mapping to 56 genes, were found to be pleiotropic. Most pleiotropic regions contained genes associated with coronary artery disease and plasma lipids, whereas some exhibited coaggregation between obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors. We observed enrichment for liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) and farnesoid X receptor/RXR nuclear receptor signaling among pleiotropic genes and for signatures of coronary artery disease and hepatic steatosis. In the search for functionally interacting networks, we found that 43 pleiotropic genes were interacting in a network with an additional 24 linker genes. ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) data were queried for distribution of pleiotropic SNPs among regulatory elements and coding sequence variations. Of the 181 SNPs, 136 were annotated to ≥ 1 regulatory feature. An enrichment analysis found over-representation of enhancers and DNAse hypersensitive regions when compared against all SNPs of the 1000 Genomes pilot project. In summary, there are genomic regions exerting pleiotropic effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors, although only a few included obesity. Further studies are needed to resolve the clustering in terms of DNA variants, genes, pathways, and actionable targets. © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Current biomedical research needs to leverage and exploit the large amount of information reported in scientific publications. Automated text mining approaches, in particular those aimed at finding relationships between entities, are key for identification of actionable knowledge from free text repositories. We present the BeFree system aimed at identifying relationships between biomedical entities with a special focus on genes and their associated diseases.; RESULTS: By exploiting morpho-syntactic information of the text, BeFree is able to identify gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations with state-of-the-art performance. The application of BeFree to real-case scenarios shows its effectiveness in extracting information relevant for translational research. We show the value of the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree through a number of analyses and integration with other data sources. BeFree succeeds in identifying genes associated to a major cause of morbidity worldwide, depression, which are not present in other public resources. Moreover, large-scale extraction and analysis of gene-disease associations, and integration with current biomedical knowledge, provided interesting insights on the kind of information that can be found in the literature, and raised challenges regarding data prioritization and curation. We found that only a small proportion of the gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing need to find alternative strategies to manual curation, in order to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications for supporting biomedical research and applications.; CONCLUSIONS: BeFree is a novel text mining system that performs competitively for the identification of gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations. Our analyses show that mining only a small fraction of MEDLINE results in a large dataset of gene-disease associations, and only a small proportion of this dataset is actually recorded in curated resources (2%), raising several issues on data prioritization and curation. We propose that joint analysis of text mined data with data curated by experts appears as a suitable approach to both assess data quality and highlight novel and interesting information.

AB INTRODUCTION: The Center for Community Health and Evaluation conducted a 3-year evaluation to assess results of health impact assessments (HIAs) in the United States and to identify elements critical for their success.; METHODS: The study used a retrospective, mixed-methods comparative case study design, including a literature review; site visits; interviews with investigators, stakeholders, and decision makers for 23 HIAs in 16 states that were completed from 2005 through 2013; and a Web-based survey of 144 HIA practitioners.; RESULTS: Analysis of interviews with decision makers suggests HIAs can directly influence decisions in nonhealth-related sectors. HIAs may also influence changes beyond the decision target, build consensus and relationships among decision makers and their constituents, and give community members a stronger voice in decisions that affect them. Factors that may increase HIA success include care in choosing a project or policy to be examined' selecting an appropriate team to conduct the HIA; engaging stakeholders and decision makers throughout the process; crafting clear, actionable recommendations; delivering timely, compelling messages to appropriate audiences; and using multiple dissemination methods. Challenges to successful HIAs include underestimating the level of effort required, political changes during the conduct of the HIA, accessing relevant local data, engaging vulnerable populations, and following up on recommendations.; CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest HIAs are a useful tool to promote public health because they can influence decisions in nonhealth-related sectors, strengthen cross-sector collaborations, and raise awareness of health issues among decision makers.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with BRAF mutation-positive advanced melanoma respond well to matched therapy with BRAF or MEK inhibitors, but often quickly develop resistance.; METHODS: Tumor tissue from ten patients with advanced BRAF mutation-positive melanoma who achieved partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) on BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors was analyzed using next generation sequencing (NGS) assay. Genomic libraries were captured for 3230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes often rearranged in cancer and sequenced to average median depth of 734X with 99% of bases covered >100X.; RESULTS: Three of the ten patients (median number of prior therapies=2) attained prolonged CR (duration=23.6+ to 28.7+ months); seven patients achieved either a PR or a short-lived CR. One patient who achieved CR ongoing at 28.7+ months and had tissue available close to the time of initiating BRAF inhibitor therapy had only a BRAF mutation. Abnormalities in addition to BRAF mutation found in other patients included: mutations in NRAS, APC and NF1; amplifications in BRAF, aurora kinase A, MYC, MITF and MET; deletions in CDKN2A/B and PAX5; and, alterations in RB1 and ATM. Heterogeneity between patients and molecular evolution within patients was noted.; CONCLUSION: NGS identified potentially actionable DNA alterations that could account for resistance in patients with BRAF mutation-positive advanced melanoma who achieved a PR or CR but whose tumors later progressed. A subset of patients with advanced melanoma may harbor only a BRAF mutation and achieve a durable CR on BRAF pathway inhibitors.

AB Genomic structural variation (SV), a common hallmark of cancer, has important predictive and therapeutic implications. However, accurately detecting SV using high-throughput sequencing data remains challenging, especially for 'targeted' resequencing efforts. This is critically important in the clinical setting where targeted resequencing is frequently being applied to rapidly assess clinically actionable mutations in tumor biopsies in a cost-effective manner. We present BreaKmer, a novel approach that uses a 'kmer' strategy to assemble misaligned sequence reads for predicting insertions, deletions, inversions, tandem duplications and translocations at base-pair resolution in targeted resequencing data. Variants are predicted by realigning an assembled consensus sequence created from sequence reads that were abnormally aligned to the reference genome. Using targeted resequencing data from tumor specimens with orthogonally validated SV, non-tumor samples and whole-genome sequencing data, BreaKmer had a 97.4% overall sensitivity for known events and predicted 17 positively validated, novel variants. Relative to four publically available algorithms, BreaKmer detected SV with increased sensitivity and limited calls in non-tumor samples, key features for variant analysis of tumor specimens in both the clinical and research settings.  © The Author(s) 2014.

AB BACKGROUND: A clinical assay was implemented to perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) of genes commonly mutated in multiple cancer types. This report describes the feasibility and diagnostic yield of this assay in 381 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).; METHODS: Clinical targeted sequencing of 23 genes was performed with DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The assay used Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture followed by Illumina HiSeq 2000, MiSeq, or HiSeq 2500 sequencing in a College of American Pathologists-accredited, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory. Single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events were reported. This assay was performed before methods were developed to detect rearrangements by NGS.; RESULTS: Two hundred nine of all requisitioned samples (55%) were successfully sequenced. The most common reason for not performing the sequencing was an insufficient quantity of tissue available in the blocks (29%). Excisional, endoscopic, and core biopsy specimens were sufficient for testing in 95%, 66%, and 40% of the cases, respectively. The median turnaround time (TAT) in the pathology laboratory was 21 days, and there was a trend of an improved TAT with more rapid sequencing platforms. Sequencing yielded a mean coverage of 1318*. Potentially actionable mutations (ie, predictive or prognostic) were identified in 46% of 209 samples and were most commonly found in KRAS (28%), epidermal growth factor receptor (14%), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (4%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (1%), and BRAF (1%). Five percent of the samples had multiple actionable mutations. A targeted therapy was instituted on the basis of NGS in 11% of the sequenced patients or in 6% of all patients.; CONCLUSIONS: NGS-based diagnostics are feasible in NSCLC and provide clinically relevant information from readily available FFPE tissue. The sample type is associated with the probability of successful testing. © 2014 American Cancer Society.

AB BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinomas of both the gastroesophageal junction and stomach are molecularly complex, but differ with respect to epidemiology, etiology and survival. There are few data directly comparing the frequencies of single nucleotide mutations in cancer-related genes between the two sites. Sequencing of targeted gene panels may be useful in uncovering multiple genomic aberrations using a single test.; METHODS: DNA from 92 gastroesophageal junction and 75 gastric adenocarcinoma resection specimens was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Targeted deep sequencing of 46 cancer-related genes was performed through emulsion PCR followed by semiconductor-based sequencing. Gastroesophageal junction and gastric carcinomas were contrasted with respect to mutational profiles, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, as well as corresponding clinicopathologic data.; RESULTS: Gastroesophageal junction carcinomas were associated with younger age, more frequent intestinal-type histology, more frequent p53 overexpression, and worse disease-free survival on multivariable analysis. Among all cases, 145 mutations were detected in 31 genes. TP53 mutations were the most common abnormality detected, and were more common in gastroesophageal junction carcinomas (42% vs. 27%, p=0.036). Mutations in the Wnt pathway components APC and CTNNB1 were more common among gastric carcinomas (16% vs. 3%, p=0.006), and gastric carcinomas were more likely to have ≥3 driver mutations detected (11% vs. 2%, p=0.044). Twenty percent of cases had potentially actionable mutations identified. R132H and R132C missense mutations in the IDH1 gene were observed, and are the first reported mutations of their kind in gastric carcinoma.; CONCLUSIONS: Panel sequencing of routine pathology material can yield mutational information on several driver genes, including some for which targeted therapies are available. Differing rates of mutations and clinicopathologic differences support a distinction between adenocarcinomas that arise in the gastroesophageal junction and those that arise in the stomach proper.

AB Clinically actionable quantification of protein biomarkers by mass spectrometry (MS) requires analytical performance in concordance with quality specifications for diagnostic tests. Laboratory-developed tests should, therefore, be validated in accordance with EN ISO 15189:2012 guidelines for medical laboratories to demonstrate competence and traceability along the entire workflow, including the selected standardization strategy and the phases before, during, and after proteolysis. In this study, bias and imprecision of a previously developed MS method for quantification of serum apolipoproteins A-I (Apo A-I) and B (Apo B) were thoroughly validated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines EP15-A2 and EP09-A3, using 100 patient sera and either stable-isotope labeled (SIL) peptides or SIL-Apo A-I as internal standard. The systematic overview of error components assigned sample preparation before the first 4 h of proteolysis as major source (85%) of within-sample imprecision without external calibration. No improvement in imprecision was observed with the use of SIL-Apo A-I instead of SIL-peptides. On the contrary, when the use of SIL-Apo A-I was combined with external calibration, imprecision improved significantly (from 9% to 6%) as a result of the normalization for matrix effects on linearity. A between-sample validation of bias in 100 patient sera further supported the presence of matrix effects on digestion completeness and additionally demonstrated specimen-specific biases associated with modified peptide sequences or alterations in protease activity. In conclusion, the presented overview of bias and imprecision components contributes to a better understanding of the sources of errors in MS-based protein quantification and provides valuable recommendations to assess and control analytical quality in concordance with the requirements for clinical use.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient safety reporting systems are now used in most health care delivery organizations. These systems, such as the one in use at Virginia Mason (Seattle) since 2002, can provide valuable reports of risk and harm from the front lines of patient care. In response to the challenge of how to quantify and prioritize safety opportunities, a risk register system was developed and implemented.; METHODS: Basic risk register concepts were refined to provide a systematic way to understand risks reported by staff. The risk register uses a comprehensive taxonomy of patient risk and algorithmically assigns each patient safety report to 1 of 27 risk categories in three major domains (Evaluation, Treatment, and Critical Interactions). For each category, a composite score was calculated on the basis of event rate, harm, and cost. The composite scores were used to identify the "top five" risk categories, and patient safety reports in these categories were analyzed in greater depth to find recurrent patterns of risk and associated opportunities for improvement.; RESULTS: The top five categories of risk were easy to identify and had distinctive "profiles" of rate, harm, and cost. The ability to categorize and rank risks across multiple dimensions yielded insights not previously available. These results were shared with leadership and served as input for planning quality and safety initiatives. This approach provided actionable input for the strategic planning process, while at the same time strengthening the Virginia Mason culture of safety.; CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative patient safety risk register serves as one solution to the challenge of extracting valuable safety lessons from large numbers of incident reports and could profitably be adopted by other organizations.

AB BACKGROUND: The personalization of cancer treatments implies the reconsideration of a one-size-fits-all paradigm. This move has spawned increased use of next generation sequencing to understand mutations and copy number aberrations in cancer cells. Initial personalization successes have been primarily driven by drugs targeting one patient-specific oncogene (e.g., Gleevec, Xalkori, Herceptin). Unfortunately, most cancers include a multitude of aberrations, and the overall impact on cancer signaling and metabolic networks cannot be easily nullified by a single drug.; METHODS: We used a novel predictive simulation approach to create an avatar of patient cancer cells using point mutations and copy number aberration data. Simulation avatars of myeloma patients were functionally screened using various molecularly targeted drugs both individually and in combination to identify drugs that are efficacious and synergistic. Repurposing of drugs that are FDA-approved or under clinical study with validated clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data can provide a rapid translational path to the clinic. High-risk multiple myeloma patients were modeled, and the simulation predictions were assessed ex vivo using patient cells.; RESULTS: Here, we present an approach to address the key challenge of interpreting patient profiling genomic signatures into actionable clinical insights to make the personalization of cancer therapy a practical reality. Through the rational design of personalized treatments, our approach also targets multiple patient-relevant pathways to address the emergence of single therapy resistance. Our predictive platform identified drug regimens for four high-risk multiple myeloma patients. The predicted regimes were found to be effective in ex vivo analyses using patient cells.; CONCLUSIONS: These multiple validations confirm this approach and methodology for the use of big data to create personalized therapeutics using predictive simulation approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: The continued development of targeted therapeutics for cancer treatment has required the concomitant development of more expansive methods for the molecular profiling of the patient's tumor. We describe the validation of the JAX Cancer Treatment Profile (JAX-CTP), a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular diagnostic assay that detects actionable mutations in solid tumors to inform the selection of targeted therapeutics for cancer treatment.; METHODS: NGS libraries are generated from DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumors. Using hybrid capture, the genes of interest are enriched and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq sequencers followed by variant detection and functional and clinical annotation for the generation of a clinical report.; RESULTS: The JAX-CTP detects actionable variants, in the form of single nucleotide variations and small insertions and deletions (≤50 bp) in 190 genes in specimens with a neoplastic cell content of ≥10%. The JAX-CTP is also validated for the detection of clinically actionable gene amplifications.; CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of consensus in the molecular diagnostics field on the best method for the validation of NGS-based assays in oncology, thus the importance of communicating methods, as contained in this report. The growing number of targeted therapeutics and the complexity of the tumor genome necessitate continued development and refinement of advanced assays for tumor profiling to enable precision cancer treatment.

AB Risk stratification is instrumental to modern clinical decision support systems. Comprehensive risk stratification should be able to provide the clinicians with not only the accurate assessment of a patient's risk but also the clinical context to be acted upon. However, existing risk stratification techniques mainly focus on predicting the risk score for individual patients; at the cohort level, they offer little insight beyond a flat score-based segmentation. This essentially reduces a patient to a score and thus removes him/her from his/her clinical context. To address this limitation, in this paper we propose a bilinear model for risk stratification that simultaneously captures the three key aspects of risk stratification: (1) it predicts the risk of each individual patient; (2) it stratifies the patient cohort based on not only the risk score but also the clinical characteristics; and (3) it embeds all patients into clinical contexts with clear interpretation. We apply our model to a cohort of 4977 patients, 1127 among which were diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). We demonstrate that our model cannot only accurately predict the onset risk of CHF but also provide rich and actionable clinical insights into the patient cohort.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB In clinical oncology, obtaining sequence data from tumour samples has become practical in terms of logistics, turnover time and costs. The major issue now is the interpretation of this sequence to define actionable targets, i.e. genome changes that are involved in tumorogenesis and that predict the efficacy of existing and available targeted treatments. This is the focus of major efforts from public clinical centres and from companies that see it as a promising commercial activity.  © 2015 medecine/sciences - Inserm.

AB We discuss the role of implementation science in cancer and summarize the need for this perspective. Following a summary of key implementation science principles and lessons learned, we review the literature on implementation of cancer prevention and control activities across the continuum from prevention to palliative care. We identified 10 unique relevant reviews, four of which were specific to cancer. Multicomponent implementation strategies were found to be superior to single-component interventions, but it was not possible to draw conclusions about specific strategies or the range of conditions across which strategies were effective. Particular gaps identified include the need for more studies of health policies and reports of cost, cost-effectiveness, and resources required. Following this review, we summarize the types of evidence needed to make research findings more actionable and discuss emerging implementation science opportunities for psychological research on cancer prevention and control. These include innovative study designs (i.e., rapid learning designs, simulation modeling, comparative effectiveness, pragmatic studies, mixed-methods research) and measurement science (i.e., development of context-relevant measures; practical, longitudinal measures to gauge improvement; cost-effectiveness data; and harmonized patient report data). We conclude by identifying a few grand challenges for psychologists that if successfully addressed would accelerate integration of evidence into cancer practice and policy more consistently and rapidly.

AB Although numerous approaches have been pursued to understand the function of human genes, Mendelian genetics has by far provided the most compelling and medically actionable dataset. Biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations are observed in the majority of autosomal recessive Mendelian disorders, representing natural human knockouts and offering a unique opportunity to study the physiological and developmental context of these genes. The restriction of such context to 'disease' states is artificial, however, and the recent ability to survey entire human genomes for biallelic LOF mutations has revealed a surprising landscape of knockout events in 'healthy' individuals, sparking interest in their role in phenotypic diversity beyond disease causation. As I discuss in this review, the potentially wide implications of human knockout research warrant increased investment and multidisciplinary collaborations to overcome existing challenges and reap its benefits.

AB BACKGROUND: In a large cluster-randomized trial on the impact of a prediction model, presenting the calculated risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) on-screen (assistive approach) increased the administration of risk-dependent PONV prophylaxis by anaesthetists. This change in therapeutic decision-making did not improve the patient outcome; that is, the incidence of PONV. The present study aimed to quantify the effects of adding a specific therapeutic recommendation to the predicted risk (directive approach) on PONV prophylaxis decision-making and the incidence of PONV.; METHODS: A prospective before-after study was conducted in 1483 elective surgical inpatients. The before-period included care-as-usual and the after-period included the directive risk-based (intervention) strategy. Risk-dependent effects on the administered number of prophylactic antiemetics and incidence of PONV were analysed by mixed-effects regression analysis.; RESULTS: During the intervention period anaesthetists administered 0.5 [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.4-0.6] more antiemetics for patients identified as being at greater risk of PONV. This directive approach led to a reduction in PONV [odds ratio (OR): 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.83], with an even greater reduction in PONV in high-risk patients (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28-0.72).; CONCLUSIONS: Anaesthetists administered more prophylactic antiemetics when a directive approach was used for risk-tailored intervention compared with care-as-usual. In contrast to the previously studied assistive approach, the increase in PONV prophylaxis now resulted in a lower PONV incidence, particularly in high-risk patients. When one aims for a truly 'PONV-free hospital', a more liberal use of prophylactic antiemetics must be accepted and lower-risk thresholds should be set for the actionable recommendations. © The Author 2014.

Molecular profiling of UC might identify biomarkers associated with targeted therapies or chemotherapeutics, providing physicians with new treatment options.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred thirty-seven cases of locally advanced or metastatic UC of the bladder, 74 nonbladder, and 55 nonurothelial bladder cancers were profiled using mutation analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry assays for biomarkers predictive of therapy response.; RESULTS: Molecular profiling of UC showed high overexpression of topoisomerase 2alpha, common phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha and/or phosophatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) alterations in nonbladder (27%) and bladder UC (21%), and rare gene mutations across subtypes. Compared with nonbladder, bladder UC consistently exhibited more frequent abnormal protein expression, including HER2 (10% vs. 3%; P = .04), tyrosine protein c-Kit receptor kinases (11% vs. 5%), c-Met proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinases (25% vs. 8%), androgen receptor (16% vs. 6%), O(6)-methylguanine-methyltransferase (63% vs. 43%), ribonucleotide reductase M1 (32% vs. 11%), Serum protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) (69% vs. 33%), and topoisomerase 1 (63% vs. 39%). Bladder UC also exhibited increased amplification of HER2 (12% vs. 2%; P = .06).; CONCLUSION: Comprehensive molecular profiling of UC identified a large number of biomarkers aberrations that might direct treatment in conventional chemotherapies and targeted therapies, not currently recommended in this population. As a group, bladder UC exhibited higher levels of actionable biomarkers, suggesting that UC from different primary sites and non-UC are driven by different molecular pathways. These differences could have clinical implications resulting in different treatment regimens depending on the site of origin of UC. Copyright © 2015 Caris Life Sciences. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Recognition of the molecular heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC) has led to the classification of CRC based on a variety of clinical and molecular characteristics. Although the clinical significance of the majority of these molecular alterations is still being ascertained, it is widely anticipated that these characteristics will improve the accuracy of our ability to determine the prognosis and therapeutic response of CRC patients. A few of these markers, such as microsatellite instability and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), show promise as predictive markers for cytotoxic chemotherapy. KRAS is a validated biomarker for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy, while NRAS and PI3KCA are evolving markers for targeted therapies. Multiple new actionable drug targets and potential response biomarkers are being identified on a regular basis, but most are not ready for clinical use at this time. This review focuses on key molecular features of CRCs and the application of these molecular alterations as predictive biomarkers for CRC.

AB Approximately 30% of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) transform to a more aggressive malignancy, most commonly diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Rarely, FL transformation results in clinical findings, histology, and immunophenotype reminiscent of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. We report the largest series to date with detailed analysis of 7 such patients. Lymphoblastic transformation occurred on average 2 years after initial diagnosis of FL. Five patients had prior intensive chemotherapy. Two patients developed mature high-grade lymphoma, followed by the lymphoblastic transformation. FL had BCL2 gene rearrangement in 4 of 5 cases. High-grade transformation was accompanied by MYC gene rearrangement (5 of 5). Transformation was characterized by expression of TdT, loss of Bcl6, variable loss of immunoglobulin light chain, and persistence of Pax-5, Bcl2, and CD10. Whole-exome sequencing in 1 case revealed presence of several actionable mutations (CD79B, CCND3, CDK12). FL, aggressive mature B cell lymphoma, and lymphoblastic transformation were clonally related in 6 evaluable cases. After transformation, survival ranged from 1 to 14 months. Four patients died of disease, 2 were in remission after stem cell transplant, and 1 was alive with disease.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic analysis of histopathological images has been widely utilized leveraging computational image-processing methods and modern machine learning techniques. Both computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and content-based image-retrieval (CBIR) systems have been successfully developed for diagnosis, disease detection, and decision support in this area. Recently, with the ever-increasing amount of annotated medical data, large-scale and data-driven methods have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus on developing scalable image-retrieval techniques to cope intelligently with massive histopathological images. Specifically, we present a supervised kernel hashing technique which leverages a small amount of supervised information in learning to compress a 10 000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with the informative signatures preserved. These binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval of images in a large database. Critically, the supervised information is employed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build a scalable image-retrieval framework based on the supervised hashing technique and validate its performance on several thousand histopathological images acquired from breast microscopic tissues. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of image classification (i.e., benign versus actionable categorization) and retrieval tests. Our framework achieves about 88.1% classification accuracy as well as promising time efficiency. For example, the framework can execute around 800 queries in only 0.01 s, comparing favorably with other commonly used dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods.

AB The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is a palliative care tool that contains standardized, actionable medical orders. It is designed to ensure that patient treatment preferences are elicited, communicated, and honored throughout the healthcare system. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to evaluate what is currently known about the POLST program and identify directions for future research. Twenty-three research studies focused on POLST use in the clinical setting were identified. A majority of studies have been conducted all or in part in Oregon, with chart review the most frequently used methodology. Research suggests that POLST is most commonly used in older, white patients who are near the end of life. A nonphysician facilitator usually prepares the POLST form for the physician to review and sign. The orders documented on POLST reflect a wide degree of individualization, with only approximately one-third of patients having orders reflecting the lowest level of treatment in all POLST form sections. Clinicians have generally positive attitudes regarding use of POLST yet report a wide range of challenges. POLST alters treatment in a way that is consistent with orders. However, evidence that POLST reflects patient or surrogate treatment preferences is lacking. Research is needed to evaluate the quality of POLST decisions, explore the experiences of patients and their surrogates, develop decision-support tools, improve clinician education, and assess the effect of POLST on care outcomes through intervention and population-based studies. © 2015, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2015, The American Geriatrics Society.

AB INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. The reasons for higher incidence and poorer survival rates among black compared with white lung cancer patients have not been defined. We hypothesized that differential incidence of somatic cancer gene mutations may be a contributing factor. Previous genomic studies of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not adequately represented black patients.; METHODS: A matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry approach was used to analyze tumor DNA for 214 coding mutations in 26 cancer genes previously identified in NSCLC. The samples included NSCLC from 335 white patients and 137 black patients. For 299 of these, normal matched DNA was available and analyzed.; RESULTS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions were only detected in women cases, with increased odds for black women compared with white women (odds ratio = 3.914, 95% confidence interval: 1.014-15.099, p = 0.048). Beyond race, variations in mutation frequencies were seen by histology. DDR2 alterations, previously described as somatic mutations, were identified as constitutional variants.; CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the largest comparing somatic mutations in black and white patients. The results point to the molecular diversity of NSCLC and raise new questions as to the importance of inherited alleles. Genomic tumor testing will benefit both populations, although the mutation spectrum appears to vary by sex, race, and histology.

AB OBJECTIVES: Choroidal metastases are uncommon metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With improved survival from the use of targeted therapy against actionable driver mutation driven NSCLC, the incidence of choroidal metastases seems to be increasing. Recently, there are several case reports of choroidal metastases in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-driven NSCLC one of which the patient's choroidal metastases had responded to crizotinib, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor against ALK/ROS1/MET. Similarly ROS1-rearranged NSCLC has very similar clinicopathologic characteristics as ALK-rearranged NSCLC and crizotinib has demonstrated significant clinical activity against ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here in this report we presented a patient with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC that presented with choroidal metastases that did not respond to initial chemotherapy but had a rapid and complete response to crizotinib.; CONCLUSIONS: Although likely to be exceeding rare, choroidal metastases from ROS1-rearranged NSCLC can be successfully treated with crizotinib similar to choroidal metastases from ALK-rearranged NSCLC can be successfully treated from another case report.

AB Children represent a special population characterized by dynamic changes which may affect drug safety and efficacy. The interplay of pharmacogenetics with physiological alterations that occur throughout development is an area of increasing research focus. Given the translational nature of pharmacogenetic research, it is possible that pharmacogenetic research results may possess clinically actionable information. The potential long-term implications of pharmacogenetic test results throughout the lifespan of the child, and the potential impact of the results for other members of the family need to be considered. Comprehensive counselling and communication strategies may need to be integrated as part of pharmacogenetic research studies in children.

AB The necessary infrastructure to carry out genomics-driven oncology is now widely available and has resulted in the exponential increase in characterized cancer genomes. While a subset of genomic alterations is clinically actionable, the majority of somatic events remain classified as variants of unknown significance and will require functional characterization. A careful cataloging of the genomic alterations and their response to therapeutic intervention should allow the compilation of an "actionability atlas" and the creation of a genomic taxonomy stratified by tumor type and oncogenic pathway activation. The next phase of genomic medicine will therefore require talented bioinformaticians, genomic navigators, and multidisciplinary approaches to decode complex cancer genomes and guide potential therapy. Equally important will be the ethical and interpretable return of results to practicing oncologists. Finally, the integration of genomics into clinical trials is likely to speed the development of predictive biomarkers of response to targeted therapy as well as define pathways to acquired resistance.

AB Whole-genome/exome sequencing used in clinical trials (CTs) to identify 'druggable' mutations and targets uncovers incidental findings unrelated to the trial objectives but of value for participants, although ethically challenging. To be disclosed to trial participants, the analytical validity, clinical validity, clinical utility, clinical relevance and actionability of incidental genomic findings (IGFs) must be established. Special considerations should be taken with minors to disclose only those findings related to early-onset conditions or diseases and in cases where early implementation of measures is necessary to prevent the occurrence of diseases. A plan for disclosing incidental findings that classifies the types that can be found, and who, when and how these findings will be disclosed to participants, should be included in the trial protocol to be approved by the relevant institutional review board. IGFs in CTs raise new ethical challenges that must be discussed by CT stakeholders, professional associations and patient advocates.

AB Measures of patients' care experiences are increasingly used as quality measures in accountability initiatives. As the prominence and financial impact of patient experience measures have increased, so too have concerns about the relevance and fairness of including them as indicators of health care quality. Using evidence from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys, the most widely used patient experience measures in the United States, we address seven common critiques of patient experience measures: (1) consumers do not have the expertise needed to evaluate care quality; (2) patient "satisfaction" is subjective and thus not valid or actionable; (3) increasing emphasis on improving patient experiences encourages health care providers and plans to fulfill patient desires, leading to care that is inappropriate, ineffective, and/or inefficient; (4) there is a trade-off between providing good patient experiences and providing high-quality clinical care; (5) patient scores cannot be fairly compared across health care providers or plans due to factors beyond providers' control; (6) response rates to patient experience surveys are low, or responses reflect only patients with extreme experiences; and (7) there are faster, cheaper, and more customized ways to survey patients than the standardized approaches mandated by federal accountability initiatives.

AB Among patients with colorectal cancer who benefit from therapy targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), stable disease (SD) occurs more frequently than massive regressions. Exploring the mechanisms of this incomplete sensitivity to devise more efficacious treatments will likely improve patients' outcomes. We tested therapies tailored around hypothesis-generating molecular features in patient-derived xenografts ("xenopatients"), which originated from 125 independent samples that did not harbor established resistance-conferring mutations. Samples from xenopatients that responded to cetuximab, an anti-EGFR agent, with disease stabilization displayed high levels of EGFR family ligands and receptors, indicating high EGFR pathway activity. Five of 21 SD models (23.8%) characterized by particularly high expression of EGFR and EGFR family members regressed after intensified EGFR blockade by cetuximab and a small-molecule inhibitor. In addition, a subset of cases in which enhanced EGFR inhibition was unproductive (6 of 16, 37.5%) exhibited marked overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Enrichment of IGF2 overexpressors among cases with SD was demonstrated in the entire xenopatient collection and was confirmed in patients by mining clinical gene expression data sets. In functional studies, IGF2 overproduction attenuated the efficacy of cetuximab. Conversely, interception of IGF2-dependent signaling in IGF2-overexpressing xenopatients potentiated the effects of cetuximab. The clinical implementation of IGF inhibitors awaits reliable predictors of response, but the results of this study suggest rational combination therapies for colorectal cancer and provide evidence for IGF2 as a biomarker of reduced tumor sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy and a determinant of response to combined IGF2/EGFR targeting.

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly heterogeneous disease. To identify potential clinically actionable therapeutic targets that may inform individualized treatment strategies, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 78 GCs of differing histologies and anatomic locations, as well as whole-genome sequencing on two GC cases, each with three primary tumors and two matching lymph node metastases. The data showed two distinct GC subtypes with either high-clonality (HiC) or low-clonality (LoC). The HiC subtype of intratumoral heterogeneity was associated with older age, TP53 (tumor protein P53) mutation, enriched C > G transition, and significantly shorter survival, whereas the LoC subtype was associated with younger age, ARID1A (AT rich interactive domain 1A) mutation, and significantly longer survival. Phylogenetic tree analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from multiple samples of two patients supported the clonal evolution of GC metastasis and revealed the accumulation of genetic defects that necessitate combination therapeutics. The most recurrently mutated genes, which were validated in a separate cohort of 216 cases by targeted sequencing, were members of the homologous recombination DNA repair, Wnt, and PI3K-ERBB pathways. Notably, the drugable NRG1 (neuregulin-1) and ERBB4 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4) ligand-receptor pair were mutated in 10% of GC cases. Mutations of the BRCA2 (breast cancer 2, early onset) gene, found in 8% of our cohort and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas GC cohort, were associated with significantly longer survivals. These data define distinct clinicogenetic forms of GC in the Chinese population that are characterized by specific mutation sets that can be investigated for efficacy of single and combination therapies.

AB A small set of gastric adenocarcinomas (9%) harbor Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA within malignant cells, and the virus is not an innocent bystander but rather is intimately linked to pathogenesis and tumor maintenance. Evidence comes from unique genomic features of host DNA, mRNA, microRNA and CpG methylation profiles as revealed by recent comprehensive genomic analysis by The Cancer Genome Atlas Network. Their data show that gastric cancer is not one disease but rather comprises four major classes: EBV-positive, microsatellite instability (MSI), genomically stable and chromosome instability. The EBV-positive class has even more marked CpG methylation than does the MSI class, and viral cancers have a unique pattern of methylation linked to the downregulation of CDKN2A (p16) but not MLH1. EBV-positive cancers often have mutated PIK3CA and ARID1A and an amplified 9p24.1 locus linked to overexpression of JAK2, CD274 (PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2). Multiple noncoding viral RNAs are highly expressed. Patients who fail standard therapy may qualify for enrollment in clinical trials targeting cancer-related human gene pathways or promoting destruction of infected cells through lytic induction of EBV genes. Genomic tests such as the GastroGenus Gastric Cancer Classifier are available to identify actionable variants in formalin-fixed cancer tissue of affected patients.

AB Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic options. By performing RNA- and exome-sequencing analyses, we report a novel fusion event, FGFR2-PPHLN1 (16%), and damaging mutations in the ARAF oncogene (11%). Here we demonstrate that the chromosomal translocation t(10;12)(q26;q12) leading to FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion possesses transforming and oncogenic activity, which is successfully inhibited by a selective FGFR2 inhibitor in vitro. Among the ARAF mutations, N217I and G322S lead to activation of the pathway and N217I shows oncogenic potential in vitro. Screening of a cohort of 107 iCCA patients reveals that FGFR2 fusions represent the most recurrent targetable alteration (45%, 17/107), while they are rarely present in other primary liver tumours (0/100 of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); 1/21 of mixed iCCA-HCC). Taken together, around 70% of iCCA patients harbour at least one actionable molecular alteration (FGFR2 fusions, IDH1/2, ARAF, KRAS, BRAF and FGF19) that is amenable for therapeutic targeting.

AB BACKGROUND: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in developing countries. While incidence of PPH can be dramatically reduced by uterotonic use immediately following birth (UUIFB) in both community and facility settings, national coverage estimates are rare. Most national health systems have no indicator to track this, and community-based measurements are even more scarce. To fill this information gap, a methodology for estimating national coverage for UUIFB was developed and piloted in four settings.; METHODS: The rapid estimation methodology consisted of convening a group of national technical experts and using the Delphi method to come to consensus on key data elements that were applied to a simple algorithm, generating a non-precise national estimate of coverage of UUIFB. Data elements needed for the calculation were the distribution of births by location and estimates of UUIFB in each of those settings, adjusted to take account of stockout rates and potency of uterotonics. This exercise was conducted in 2013 in Mozambique, Tanzania, the state of Jharkhand in India, and Yemen.; RESULTS: Available data showed that deliveries in public health facilities account for approximately half of births in Mozambique and Tanzania, 16% in Jharkhand and 24% of births in Yemen. Significant proportions of births occur in private facilities in Jharkhand and faith-based facilities in Tanzania. Estimated uterotonic use for facility births ranged from 70 to 100%. Uterotonics are not used routinely for PPH prevention at home births in any of the settings. National UUIFB coverage estimates of all births were 43% in Mozambique, 40% in Tanzania, 44% in Jharkhand, and 14% in Yemen.; CONCLUSION: This methodology for estimating coverage of UUIFB was found to be feasible and acceptable. While the exercise produces imprecise estimates whose validity cannot be assessed objectively in the absence of a gold standard estimate, stakeholders felt they were accurate enough to be actionable. The exercise highlighted information and practice gaps and promoted discussion on ways to improve UUIFB measurement and coverage, particularly of home births. Further follow up is needed to verify actions taken. The methodology produces useful data to help accelerate efforts to reduce maternal mortality.

AB Urothelial cancer has long been known as a chemotherapy-sensitive disease. However, clinical trial data to date suggest a plateau to the magnitude of benefit from cytotoxic therapy alone. In spite of level 1 evidence supporting cisplatin-based chemotherapy for patients with muscle-invasive and metastatic urothelial cancer, underuse prevails among patients with localized disease and only a modest survival benefit exists in the metastatic setting, although trials have consistently demonstrated that there is a subset of patients who clearly benefit. Recent comprehensive genomic profiling has identified a high prevalence of actionable genomic alterations as well as other potential targets yet to be fully understood. Modern clinical trials must now focus on identifying predictive biomarkers to select those patients who will benefit most from cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, or potentially both. © 2014 American Cancer Society.

AB The Hundred Person Wellness Project (HPWP) is a 10-month pilot study of 100 'well' individuals where integrated data from whole-genome sequencing, gut microbiome, clinical laboratory tests and quantified self measures from each individual are used to provide actionable results for health coaching with the goal of optimizing wellness and minimizing disease. In a commentary in BMC Medicine, Diamandis argues that HPWP and similar projects will likely result in 'unnecessary and potential harmful over-testing'. We argue that this new approach will ultimately lead to lower costs, better healthcare, innovation and economic growth. The central points of the HPWP are: 1) it is focused on optimizing wellness through longitudinal data collection, integration and mining of individual data clouds, enabling development of predictive models of wellness and disease that will reveal actionable possibilities; and 2) by extending this study to 100,000 well people, we will establish multiparameter, quantifiable wellness metrics and identify markers for wellness to early disease transitions for most common diseases, which will ultimately allow earlier disease intervention, eventually transitioning the individual early on from a disease back to a wellness trajectory.

AB Reproducibility and reusability of research results is an important concern in scientific communication and science policy. A foundational element of reproducibility and reusability is the open and persistently available presentation of research data. However, many common approaches for primary data publication in use today do not achieve sufficient long-term robustness, openness, accessibility or uniformity. Nor do they permit comprehensive exploitation by modern Web technologies. This has led to several authoritative studies recommending uniform direct citation of data archived in persistent repositories. Data are to be considered as first-class scholarly objects, and treated similarly in many ways to cited and archived scientific and scholarly literature. Here we briefly review the most current and widely agreed set of principle-based recommendations for scholarly data citation, the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP). We then present a framework for operationalizing the JDDCP; and a set of initial recommendations on identifier schemes, identifier resolution behavior, required metadata elements, and best practices for realizing programmatic machine actionability of cited data. The main target audience for the common implementation guidelines in this article consists of publishers, scholarly organizations, and persistent data repositories, including technical staff members in these organizations. But ordinary researchers can also benefit from these recommendations. The guidance provided here is intended to help achieve widespread, uniform human and machine accessibility of deposited data, in support of significantly improved verification, validation, reproducibility and re-use of scholarly/scientific data.

AB AIM: To describe the knowledge and attitudes of clinicians participating in a large pharmacogenomics implementation program.; MATERIALS & METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 15 physicians and nurse practitioners were conducted.; RESULTS: Three categories of themes were identified: preparation and knowledge, pharmacogenomics usage in practice, and future management of genomic variants. Providers expressed an inability to keep up with the rapid pace of evidence generation and indicated strong support for clinical decision support to assist with genotype-tailored therapies. Concerns raised by clinicians included effectively communicating results, long-term responsibility for actionable results and hand-offs with providers outside the implementation program.; CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians identified their own knowledge deficits, workflow integration, and longitudinal responsibility as challenges to successful usage of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice.

AB Aging is a complex continuous multifactorial process leading to loss of function and crystalizing into the many age-related diseases. Here, we explore the arguments for classifying aging as a disease in the context of the upcoming World Health Organization's 11th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), expected to be finalized in 2018. We hypothesize that classifying aging as a disease with a "non-garbage" set of codes will result in new approaches and business models for addressing aging as a treatable condition, which will lead to both economic and healthcare benefits for all stakeholders. Actionable classification of aging as a disease may lead to more efficient allocation of resources by enabling funding bodies and other stakeholders to use quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthy-years equivalent (HYE) as metrics when evaluating both research and clinical programs. We propose forming a Task Force to interface the WHO in order to develop a multidisciplinary framework for classifying aging as a disease with multiple disease codes facilitating for therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies.

AB Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers are derived from the follicular cells in the thyroid gland, which secrete the iodine-containing thyroid hormones. Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers can be classified into papillary thyroid cancer (80-85%), follicular thyroid cancer (10-15%), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (<2%) and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid cancer (<2%), and these have an excellent prognosis with the exception of undifferentiated thyroid cancer. The advent and expansion of advanced diagnostic techniques has driven and continues to drive the epidemic of occult papillary thyroid cancer, owing to overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant nodules. This transformation of the thyroid cancer landscape at molecular and clinical levels calls for the modification of management strategies towards personalized medicine based on individual risk assessment to deliver the most effective but least aggressive treatment. In thyroid cancer surgery, for instance, injuries to structures outside the thyroid gland, such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve in 2-5% of surgeries or the parathyroid glands in 5-10% of surgeries, negatively affect quality of life more than loss of the expendable thyroid gland. Furthermore, the risks associated with radioiodine ablation may outweigh the risks of persistent or recurrent disease and disease-specific mortality. Improvement in the health-related quality of life of survivors of follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer, which is decreased despite the generally favourable outcome, hinges on early tumour detection and minimization of treatment-related sequelae. Future opportunities include more widespread adoption of molecular and clinical risk stratification and identification of actionable targets for individualized therapies.

AB INTRODUCTION: Advent of new technologies in mobile devices and software applications is leading to an evolving change in the extent, geographies and modes for use of internet. Today, it is used not only for information gathering but for sharing of experiences, opinions and suggestions. Web-Recognizing Adverse Drug Reactions (RADR) is a groundbreaking European Union (EU) Innovative Medicines Innovation funded 3-year initiative to recommend policies, frameworks, tools and methodologies by leveraging these new developments to get new insights in drug safety.; AREAS COVERED: Data were gathered from prior surveys, previous initiatives and a review of relevant literature was done. New technologies provide an opportunity in the way safety information is collected, helping generate new knowledge for safety profile of drugs as well as unique insights into the evolving pharmacovigilance system in general. It is critical that these capabilities are harnessed in a way that is ethical, compliant with regulations, respecting data privacy and used responsibly. At the same time, the process for managing and interpreting this new information must be efficient and effective for sustenance, thoughtful use of resources and valuable return of knowledge. These approaches should complement the ongoing progress toward personalized medicine.; EXPERT OPINION: This Web-RADR initiative should provide some directions on 'what and how' to use social media to further proactive pharmacovigilance and protection of public health. It is expected to also show how a multipronged expert consortium group comprising regulators, industry and academia can leverage new developments in technology and society to bring innovation in process, operations, organization and scientific approaches across its boundaries and beyond the normal realms of individual research units. These new approaches should bring insights faster, earlier, specific, actionable and moving toward the target of AE prevention. The possibilities of a blended targeted pharmacovigilance (PV) approach where boundaries between stakeholders blur and cultures mix point to very different future for better, healthier and longer lives.

AB Primary mediastinal B-Cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a recently defined entity comprising ~2-10% non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Unlike most NHL subtypes, PMBL lacks recurrent gene rearrangements to serve as biomarkers or betray target genes. While druggable, late chemotherapeutic complications warrant the search for new targets and models. Well characterized tumor cell lines provide unlimited material to serve as preclinical resources for verifiable analyses directed at the discovery of new biomarkers and pathological targets using high throughput microarray technologies. The same cells may then be used to seek intelligent therapies directed at clinically validated targets. Four cell lines have emerged as potential PMBL models: FARAGE, KARPAS-1106P, MEDB-1 and U-2940. Transcriptionally, PMBL cell lines cluster near c(lassical)-HL and B-NHL examples showing they are related but separate entities. Here we document genomic alterations therein, by cytogenetics and high density oligonucleotide/SNP microarrays and parse their impact by integrated global expression profiling. PMBL cell lines were distinguished by moderate chromosome rearrangement levels undercutting cHL, while lacking oncogene translocations seen in B-NHL. In total 61 deletions were shared by two or more cell lines, together with 12 amplifications (≥4x) and 72 homozygous regions. Integrated genomic and transcriptional profiling showed deletions to be the most important class of chromosome rearrangement. Lesions were mapped to several loci associated with PMBL, e.g. 2p15 (REL/COMMD1), 9p24 (JAK2, CD274), 16p13 (SOCS1, LITAF, CIITA); plus new or tenuously associated loci: 2p16 (MSH6), 6q23 (TNFAIP3), 9p22 (CDKN2A/B), 20p12 (PTPN1). Discrete homozygous regions sometimes substituted focal deletions accompanied by gene silencing implying a role for epigenetic or mutational inactivation. Genomic amplifications increasing gene expression or gene-activating rearrangements were respectively rare or absent. Our findings highlight biallelic deletions as a major class of chromosomal lesion in PMBL cell lines, while endorsing the latter as preclinical models for hunting and testing new biomarkers and actionable targets.

AB Fooks et al. (2015) propose patient-centred care and engagement as "levers for change" in a healthcare system increasingly challenged to care for patients living with complex chronic illness. Patient-centred care, engagement and experience are presented as inherently relational concepts, but who is included under that relational umbrella is less clear. Using the rubric of "finding common ground" from the model of patient-centred care described by Hudon et al. (2011), I argue for including provider perspectives, not just patient/family. Otherwise the envisioned conversations of "change" will be missing the voices of those expected to facilitate the meaningful relational engagement of patients and the process of shared decision-making. I also discuss relational communication competence as a key factor in successful patient-engagement, patient-centred care and, ultimately, the healthcare experience. Without attention to both these elements - broadening the understanding of therapeutic relationship to encompass all contributing stakeholders and the relational communication competency so necessary to this endeavour - whatever consensus we reach will be missing important aspects related to actionable content and process, both of which are needed to guide the development of relevant metrics. Without metrics, we will lack rigorous "evidence" with which to make the case that patient-centred care and engagement are indeed "levers" for positive system reform.

AB Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) carries a poor prognosis with an overall 5-year survival of 13.1%. Therapies guided by tumor profiling have suggested benefit in advanced cancer. We used a multiplatform molecular profiling (MP) approach to identify key molecular changes that may provide therapeutic options not typically considered in mCRC. We evaluated 6892 mCRC referred to Caris Life Sciences by MP including sequencing (Sanger/NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ hybridization (ISH). mCRC metastases to liver, brain, ovary or lung (n = 1507) showed differential expression of markers including high protein expression of TOPO1 (52%) and/or low RRM1 (57%), TS (71%) and MGMT (39%), suggesting possible benefit from irinotecan, gemcitabine, 5FU/capecitabine and temozolomide, respectively. Lung metastases harbored a higher Her2 protein expression than the primary colon tumors (4% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.028). Brain and lung metastases had higher KRAS mutations than other sites (65% vs 59% vs 47%, respectively, p = 0.07, <0.01), suggesting poor response to anti-EGFR therapies. BRAF-mutated CRC (n = 455) showed coincident high protein expression of RRM1 (56%), TS (53%) and low PDGFR (22%) as compared with BRAF wild-type tumors. KRAS-mutated mCRC had higher protein expression of c-MET (47% vs. 36%) and lower MGMT (56% vs. 63%), suggesting consideration of c-MET inhibitors and temozolomide. KRAS-mutated CRC had high TUBB3 (42% vs. 33%) and low Her2 by IHC (0.5%) and HER2 by FISH (3%, p <0.05). CRC primaries had a lower incidence of PIK3CA and BRAF mutations in rectal cancer versus colon cancer (10% and 3.3%, respectively). MP of 6892 CRCs identified significant differences between primary and metastatic sites and among BRAF/KRAS sub-types. Our findings are hypothesis generating and need to be examined in prospective studies. Specific therapies may be considered for different actionable targets in mCRC as revealed by MP.

AB Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process, involving the acquisition of multiple oncogenic mutations that transform cells, resulting in systemic dysregulation that enables proliferation, invasion, and other cancer hallmarks. The goal of precision medicine is to identify therapeutically-actionable mutations from large-scale omic datasets. However, the multiplicity of oncogenes required for transformation, known as oncogenic collaboration, makes assigning effective treatments difficult. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new type of oncogenic collaboration where mutations in genes that interact with an oncogene may contribute to the oncogene's deleterious potential, a new genomic feature that we term "surrogate oncogenes." Surrogate oncogenes are representatives of these mutated subnetworks that interact with oncogenes. By mapping mutations to a protein-protein interaction network, we determine the significance of the observed distribution using permutation-based methods. For a panel of 38 breast cancer cell lines, we identified a significant number of surrogate oncogenes in known oncogenes such as BRCA1 and ESR1, lending credence to this approach. In addition, using Random Forest Classifiers, we show that these significant surrogate oncogenes predict drug sensitivity for 74 drugs in the breast cancer cell lines with a mean error rate of 30.9%. Additionally, we show that surrogate oncogenes are predictive of survival in patients. The surrogate oncogene framework incorporates unique or rare mutations from a single sample, and therefore has the potential to integrate patient-unique mutations into drug sensitivity predictions, suggesting a new direction in precision medicine and drug development. Additionally, we show the prevalence of significant surrogate oncogenes in multiple cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas, suggesting that surrogate oncogenes may be a useful genomic feature for guiding pancancer analyses and assigning therapies across many tissue types.

AB The presence of activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-gene identifies a distinct and clinically relevant molecular subset of non-small-cell lung cancer. It is now well demonstrated that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are superior to standard chemotherapy in this subset of tumors. Nevertheless, in many cases, responses are not durable and last for 6-12 months due to the occurrence of secondary or acquired resistance. Here we present three cases of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas (ADC), that showed an unexpected response to anti-EGFR small molecules. The first patient presented a continued 89 month-long response to erlotinib in a tumor recurred after surgery and conventional chemotherapy. In the other cases, subclinically persistent tumor in the lung tissue was documented histologically in lung resections performed after partial response to TKI treatment. The persistence of interstitial and endolymphatic tumor cells after TKI treatment might explain the common observation of tumor relapse after TKI discontinuation, and sustain the decision to continue treatment in responsive patients as in our first case.

AB Non-targeted identification of microbes is now possible directly in biological samples, based on whole-genome-NGS (WG-NGS) techniques that allow deep sequencing of nucleic acids, data mining and sorting out of sequences of pathogens without any a priori hypothesis. WG-NGS was first only used as a research tool due to its cost, complexity and lack of standardization. Recent improvements in sample preparation and bioinformatics pipelines and decrease in cost now allow actionable diagnostics in patients. The potency and limits of WG-NGS and possible future indications are discussed here. WG-NGS will likely soon become a standard procedure in microbiological diagnosis.

AB Advances in tumor genome sequencing have enabled discovery of actionable alterations leading to novel therapies. Currently, there are approved targeted therapies across various tumors that can be matched to genomic alterations, such as point mutations, gene amplification, and translocations. Tools to detect these genomic alterations have emerged as a result of decreasing costs and improved throughput enabled by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. NGS has been successfully utilized for developing biomarkers to assess susceptibility, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancers. However, clinical application presents some potential challenges in terms of tumor specimen acquisition, analysis, privacy, interpretation, and drug development in rare cancer subsets. Although whole-genome sequencing offers the most complete strategy for tumor analysis, its present utility in clinical care is limited. Consequently, targeted gene capture panels are more commonly employed by academic institutions and commercial vendors for clinical grade cancer genomic testing to assess molecular eligibility for matching therapies, whereas whole-exome and transcriptome (RNASeq) sequencing are being utilized for discovery research. This review discusses the strategies, clinical challenges, and opportunities associated with the application of cancer genomic testing for precision cancer medicine.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a molecularly diverse disease. This heterogeneity has limited the success of targeted therapy in unselected patients to date. Recent transcriptional analysis has divided TNBC into transcriptionally similar subtypes that may have different sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy. At present, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for early-stage and advanced TNBC; however, several actionable targets show promise in preclinical studies. Novel therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in phase II and phase III trials and will likely require patient stratification before therapy. Examples of these tailored approaches include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-mutated TNBC, antiandrogens for androgen receptor (AR)-positive TNBC, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors for TNBC harboring FGFR amplifications, and gamma-secretase inhibitors for TNBC with mutations in the PEST domain of NOTCH proteins. Treatment of TNBC based on molecular subsets represents a potential algorithm for the future. Well-designed clinical trials with incorporation of integrated biomarkers are necessary to advance the development of molecularly targeted therapy for different subgroups of TNBC.

AB Patient-reported outcomes capture a unique and important perspective of oncology therapy. Surveys to properly capture patient-reported outcome measures have been under development for more than 2 decades. More recent efforts to understand the clinical significance of patient-reported outcomes, called performance measures, are underway. Patient-reported outcomes can be used in a variety of ways, including therapy decisions for an individual patient, payment for treatment, research into disease progression, or new drug development. Technology has already enabled electronic systems to capture and search patient-reported outcomes and in the future will assist in capturing everyday activities, which, in combination with improved informatics to sort the meaningful and actionable information, will reduce the time commitment for both patients and providers.

AB The structure, interdependence, and fragility of systems ranging from power-grids and transportation to ecology, climate, biology and even human communities and the Internet have been examined through network science. While response to perturbations has been quantified, recovery strategies for perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science based quantitative framework for measuring, comparing and interpreting hazard responses as well as recovery strategies. The framework, motivated by the recently proposed temporal resilience paradigm, is demonstrated with the Indian Railways Network. Simulations inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as well as a cyber-physical attack scenario illustrate hazard responses and effectiveness of proposed recovery strategies. Multiple metrics are used to generate various recovery strategies, which are simply sequences in which system components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of these strategies suggests that faster and more efficient recovery is possible through network centrality measures. Optimal recovery strategies may be different per hazard, per community within a network, and for different measures of partial recovery. In addition, topological characterization provides a means for interpreting the comparative performance of proposed recovery strategies. The methods can be directly extended to other Large-Scale Critical Lifeline Infrastructure Networks including transportation, water, energy and communications systems that are threatened by natural or human-induced hazards, including cascading failures. Furthermore, the quantitative framework developed here can generalize across natural, engineered and human systems, offering an actionable and generalizable approach for emergency management in particular as well as for network resilience in general.

AB In the post-Affordable Care Act landscape (ACA), comprehensive care management has become an essential component in the universal goal to reduce hospital readmissions and their associated costs. Utilizing real-time home health monitoring technologies, hospitals can transform transitional care from hospital to home while significantly improving long-term home care outcomes. To achieve the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim, we need widespread commitment and investment in home healthcare IT that connects clinicians, providers, and payers to patients with speed and accuracy. Technology that generates real-time actionable health care data from the home is an essential key to progress in this endeavor.

AB Cell-free circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma has been shown to be informative of the genomic alterations present in tumours and has been used to monitor tumour progression and response to treatments. However, patients with brain tumours do not present with or present with low amounts of ctDNA in plasma precluding the genomic characterization of brain cancer through plasma ctDNA. Here we show that ctDNA derived from central nervous system tumours is more abundantly present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than in plasma. Massively parallel sequencing of CSF ctDNA more comprehensively characterizes the genomic alterations of brain tumours than plasma, allowing the identification of actionable brain tumour somatic mutations. We show that CSF ctDNA levels longitudinally fluctuate in time and follow the changes in brain tumour burden providing biomarkers to monitor brain malignancies. Moreover, CSF ctDNA is shown to facilitate and complement the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB Heart failure (HF) is a costly, challenging and highly prevalent medical condition. Hospitalization for acute decompensation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite application of evidence-based medical therapies and technologies, HF remains a formidable challenge for virtually all healthcare systems. Repeat hospitalizations for acute decompensated HF (ADHF) can have major financial impact on institutions and resources. Early and accurate identification of impending ADHF is of paramount importance yet there is limited high quality evidence or infrastructure to guide management in the outpatient setting. Historically, ADHF was identified by physical exam findings or invasive hemodynamic monitoring during a hospital admission; however, advances in medical microelectronics and the advent of device-based diagnostics have enabled long-term ambulatory monitoring of HF patients in the outpatient setting. These monitors have evolved from piggybacking on cardiac implantable electrophysiologic devices to standalone implantable hemodynamic monitors that transduce left atrial or pulmonary artery pressures as surrogate measures of left ventricular filling pressure. As technology evolves, devices will likely continue to miniaturize while their capabilities grow. An important, persistent challenge that remains is developing systems to translate the large volumes of real-time data, particularly data trends, into actionable information that leads to appropriate, safe and timely interventions without overwhelming outpatient cardiology and general medical practices. Future directions for implantable hemodynamic monitors beyond their utility in heart failure may include management of other major chronic diseases such as pulmonary hypertension, end stage renal disease and portal hypertension.

AB Patient materials are often written above the reading level of most adults. Tool 11 of the Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit ("Design Easy-to-Read Material") provides guidance on ensuring that written patient materials are easy to understand. As part of a pragmatic demonstration of the Toolkit, we examined how four primary care practices implemented Tool 11 and whether written materials improved as a result. We conducted interviews to learn about practices' implementation activities and assessed the readability, understandability, and actionability of patient education materials collected during pre- and postimplementation site visits. Interview data indicated that practices followed many action steps recommended in Tool 11, including training staff, assessing readability, and developing or revising materials, typically focusing on brief documents such as patient letters and information sheets. Many of the revised and newly developed documents had reading levels appropriate for most patients and--in the case of revised documents--better readability than the original materials. In contrast, the readability, understandability, and actionability of lengthier patient education materials were poor and did not improve over the 6-month implementation period. Findings guided revisions to Tool 11 and highlighted the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in improving the quality of patient materials.

AB Determining what constitutes an anticipatable incidental finding (IF) from clinical research and defining whether, and when, this IF should be returned to the participant have been topics of discussion in the field of human subject protections for the last 10 years. It has been debated that implementing a comprehensive IF-approach that addresses both the responsibility of researchers to return IFs and the expectation of participants to receive them can be logistically challenging. IFs have been debated at different levels, such as the ethical reasoning for considering their disclosure or the need for planning for them during the development of the research study. Some authors have discussed the methods for re-contacting participants for disclosing IFs, as well as the relevance of considering the clinical importance of the IFs. Similarly, other authors have debated about when IFs should be disclosed to participants. However, no author has addressed how the "actionability" of the IFs should be considered, evaluated, or characterized at the participant's research setting level. This paper defines the concept of "Actionability at the Participant's Research Setting Level" (APRSL) for anticipatable IFs from clinical research, discusses some related ethical concepts to justify the APRSL concept, proposes a strategy to incorporate APRSL into the planning and management of IFs, and suggests a strategy for integrating APRSL at each local research setting.  © 2015 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc.

AB Personalized medicine has recently become a main goal for healthcare policy. It is often defined as the tailoring of diagnosis and therapies to the genetic profile of each patient, and as such it is supposed to overcome the major thorny issues at stake in biomedicine today. This challenging program is primarily carried out by new approaches in biomedical imaging, molecular analysis, drug delivery and follow-up, taking more and more advantage of nanotechnology. However, in current literature and debates, the term 'personalized medicine' appears to be polysemous. The paper examines this polysemy. It links it to rival epistemic and technological choices in research programs, and it finally argues that this techno-epistemic plurality echoes conflicting expectations and values among today's biomedicine actors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Research studies show that social media may be valuable tools in the disease surveillance toolkit used for improving public health professionals' ability to detect disease outbreaks faster than traditional methods and to enhance outbreak response. A social media work group, consisting of surveillance practitioners, academic researchers, and other subject matter experts convened by the International Society for Disease Surveillance, conducted a systematic primary literature review using the PRISMA framework to identify research, published through February 2013, answering either of the following questions: Can social media be integrated into disease surveillance practice and outbreak management to support and improve public health?Can social media be used to effectively target populations, specifically vulnerable populations, to test an intervention and interact with a community to improve health outcomes?Examples of social media included are Facebook, MySpace, microblogs (e.g., Twitter), blogs, and discussion forums. For Question 1, 33 manuscripts were identified, starting in 2009 with topics on Influenza-like Illnesses (n = 15), Infectious Diseases (n = 6), Non-infectious Diseases (n = 4), Medication and Vaccines (n = 3), and Other (n = 5). For Question 2, 32 manuscripts were identified, the first in 2000 with topics on Health Risk Behaviors (n = 10), Infectious Diseases (n = 3), Non-infectious Diseases (n = 9), and Other (n = 10).; CONCLUSIONS: The literature on the use of social media to support public health practice has identified many gaps and biases in current knowledge. Despite the potential for success identified in exploratory studies, there are limited studies on interventions and little use of social media in practice. However, information gleaned from the articles demonstrates the effectiveness of social media in supporting and improving public health and in identifying target populations for intervention. A primary recommendation resulting from the review is to identify opportunities that enable public health professionals to integrate social media analytics into disease surveillance and outbreak management practice.

AB A newer generation of anti-cancer drugs targeting underlying somatic genetic driver events have resulted in high single-agent or single-pathway response rates in selected patients, but few patients achieve complete responses and a sizeable fraction of patients relapse within a year. Thus, there is a pressing need for identification of combinations of targeted agents which induce more complete responses and prevent disease progression. We describe the results of a combination screen of an unprecedented scale in mammalian cells performed using a collection of targeted, clinically tractable agents across a large panel of melanoma cell lines. We find that even the most synergistic drug pairs are effective only in a discrete number of cell lines, underlying a strong context dependency for synergy, with strong, widespread synergies often corresponding to non-specific or off-target drug effects such as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) transporter inhibition. We identified drugs sensitizing cell lines that are BRAFV600E mutant but intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/kinase insert domain receptor (VEGFR/KDR) and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family inhibitor cediranib. The combination of cediranib and PLX4720 induced apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in animal models. This synergistic interaction is likely due to engagement of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), demonstrating the potential of drug- rather than gene-specific combination discovery approaches. Patients with elevated biopsy KDR expression showed decreased progression free survival in trials of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase pathway inhibitors. Thus, high-throughput unbiased screening of targeted drug combinations, with appropriate library selection and mechanistic follow-up, can yield clinically-actionable drug combinations.

AB OBJECTIVE: Patient-centered clinical trial design and execution is becoming increasingly important. No best practice guidelines exist despite a key stakeholder declaration to create more effective engagement models. This study aims to gain a better understanding of attitudes and practices for engaging patient groups so that actionable recommendations may be developed.; METHODS: Individuals from industry, academic institutions, and patient groups were identified through Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative and Drug Information Association rosters and mailing lists. Objectives, practices, and perceived barriers related to engaging patient groups in the planning, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trials were reported in an online survey. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of survey data followed a literature review to inform survey questions.; RESULTS: Survey respondents (n = 179) valued the importance of involving patient groups in research; however, patient group respondents valued their contributions to research protocol development, funding acquisition, and interpretation of study results more highly than those contributions were valued by industry and academic respondents (all p < .001). Patient group respondents placed higher value in open communications, clear expectations, and detailed contract execution than did non-patient group respondents (all p < .05). Industry and academic respondents more often cited internal bureaucratic processes and reluctance to share information as engagement barriers than did patient group respondents (all p < .01). Patient groups reported that a lack of transparency and understanding of the benefits of collaboration on the part of industry and academia were greater barriers than did non-patient group respondents (all p< .01).; CONCLUSIONS: Despite reported similarities among approaches to engagement by the three stakeholder groups, key differences exist in perceived barriers and benefits to partnering with patient groups among the sectors studied. This recognition could inform the development of best practices for patient-centered clinical trial design and execution. Additional research is needed to define and optimize key success factors.

AB One reason for not seeking personally threatening information may be negative current and anticipated affective responses. We examined whether current (e.g., worry) and anticipated negative affect predicted intentions to seek sequencing results in the context of an actual genomic sequencing trial (ClinSeq; n = 545) and whether spontaneous self-affirmation mitigated any (negative) association between affect and intentions. Anticipated affective response negatively predicted intentions to obtain and share results pertaining to both medically actionable and non-actionable disease, whereas current affect was only a marginal predictor. The negative association between anticipated affect and intentions to obtain results pertaining to non-actionable disease was weaker in individuals who were higher in spontaneous self-affirmation. These results have implications for the understanding of current and anticipated affect, self-affirmation and consequential decision-making and contribute to a growing body of evidence on the role of affect in medical decisions.

AB BACKGROUND: Due to their working conditions, seafarers often don't benefit from the same medical coverage than the onshore population. Therefore, seafarers and their relatives often need to locate health information by themselves. While the rise of the Internet has drastically transformed the way people can gather information, the availability of specific maritime health information online still need to be evaluated scientifically. We aim here to document of the characteristic of maritime health-related online information.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web survey was performed, articulated on two complementary analyses. First, an overall analysis of websites related to maritime health compared to websites related to two other health areas relevant for the general population (dental health and otorhinolaryngology) used as control. Second, an analysis of the understandability and actionability of a series of Wikipedia articles related to pathologies relevant for seafarers using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT).; RESULTS: Online resources associated with maritime health were sparse and difficult to locate. When compared to other medical fields, maritime health websites were extremely poor in displaying useful information for seafarers. Available online resources regarding specific diseases affecting seafarers were mainly not adapted for a general audience and scored poorly both in terms of understandability and of actionability.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a general overview of the degree of adaption of online material related to maritime health to seafarers' potential needs. Considerably more efforts need to be made in order to provide controlled online materials to answer the health information needs of the seafarers and their relatives.

AB Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a new genome-based technology showing great promise in delineating the genetic basis of autism thus facilitating diagnosis and in the future, the selection of treatment. NGS can have a targeted use as well as provide clinically important findings from medically actionable variants regarding the risk of other disorders. As more is learned about the genomic basis of autism, the clinical utility of the risk information will increase. But at what cost? As the medical management that ensues from primary and secondary (incidental) findings grows, there will be increased pressure on sub-specialists with a longer and more circuitous pathway to care. This will result in higher costs to health care systems and to families. Health technology assessment is needed to measure the additional costs associated with NGS compared to standard care and to weigh these costs against additional health benefits. Well-designed data collection systems should be implemented early in clinical translation of this technology to enable assessment of clinical utility and cost-effectiveness and to generate high quality evidence to inform clinical and budget allocation decision-making.

AB The identification of the molecular drivers of cancer by sequencing is the backbone of precision medicine and the basis of personalized therapy; however, biopsies of primary tumors provide only a snapshot of the evolution of the disease and may miss potential therapeutic targets, especially in the metastatic setting. A liquid biopsy, in the form of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing, has the potential to capture the inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity present in metastatic disease, and, through serial blood draws, track the evolution of the tumor genome. In order to determine the clinical utility of cfDNA sequencing we performed whole-exome sequencing on cfDNA and tumor DNA from two patients with metastatic disease; only minor modifications to our sequencing and analysis pipelines were required for sequencing and mutation calling of cfDNA. The first patient had metastatic sarcoma and 47 of 48 mutations present in the primary tumor were also found in the cell-free DNA. The second patient had metastatic breast cancer and sequencing identified an ESR1 mutation in the cfDNA and metastatic site, but not in the primary tumor. This likely explains tumor progression on Anastrozole. Significant heterogeneity between the primary and metastatic tumors, with cfDNA reflecting the metastases, suggested separation from the primary lesion early in tumor evolution. This is best illustrated by an activating PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) which was clonal in the primary tumor, but completely absent from either the metastasis or cfDNA. Here we show that cfDNA sequencing supplies clinically actionable information with minimal risks compared to metastatic biopsies. This study demonstrates the utility of whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA from patients with metastatic disease. cfDNA sequencing identified an ESR1 mutation, potentially explaining a patient's resistance to aromatase inhibition, and gave insight into how metastatic lesions differ from the primary tumor.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric cardiomyopathies are a rare, yet heterogeneous group of pathologies of the myocardium that are routinely examined clinically using Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). This gold standard powerful non-invasive tool yields high resolution temporal images that characterize myocardial tissue. The complexities associated with the annotation of images and extraction of markers, necessitate the development of efficient workflows to acquire, manage and transform this data into actionable knowledge for patient care to reduce mortality and morbidity.; METHODS: We develop and test a novel informatics framework called cMRI-BED for biomarker extraction and discovery from such complex pediatric cMRI data that includes the use of a suite of tools for image processing, marker extraction and predictive modeling. We applied our workflow to obtain and analyze a dataset of 83 de-identified cases and controls containing cMRI-derived biomarkers for classifying positive versus negative findings of cardiomyopathy in children. Bayesian rule learning (BRL) methods were applied to derive understandable models in the form of propositional rules with posterior probabilities pertaining to their validity. Popular machine learning methods in the WEKA data mining toolkit were applied using default parameters to assess cross-validation performance of this dataset using accuracy and percentage area under ROC curve (AUC) measures.; RESULTS: The best 10-fold cross validation predictive performance obtained on this cMRI-derived biomarker dataset was 80.72% accuracy and 79.6% AUC by a BRL decision tree model, which is promising from this type of rare data. Moreover, we were able to verify that mycocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) status, which is known to be an important qualitative factor in the classification of cardiomyopathies, is picked up by our rule models as an important variable for prediction.; CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show the feasibility of our framework for processing such data while also yielding actionable predictive classification rules that can augment knowledge conveyed in cardiac radiology outcome reports. Interactions between MDE status and other cMRI parameters that are depicted in our rules warrant further investigation and validation. Predictive rules learned from cMRI data to classify positive and negative findings of cardiomyopathy can enhance scientific understanding of the underlying interactions among imaging-derived parameters.

AB The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that clinical sequencing laboratories return secondary findings in 56 genes associated with medically actionable conditions. Our goal was to apply a systematic, stringent approach consistent with clinical standards to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic variants associated with such conditions using a diverse sequencing reference sample. Candidate variants in the 56 ACMG genes were selected from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes dataset, which contains sequencing information on 1,092 unrelated individuals from across the world. These variants were filtered using the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional version and defined parameters, appraised through literature review, and examined by a clinical laboratory specialist and expert physician. Over 70,000 genetic variants were extracted from the 56 genes, and filtering identified 237 variants annotated as disease causing by HGMD Professional. Literature review and expert evaluation determined that 7 of these variants were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Furthermore, 5 additional truncating variants not listed as disease causing in HGMD Professional were identified as likely pathogenic. These 12 secondary findings are associated with diseases that could inform medical follow-up, including cancer predisposition syndromes, cardiac conditions, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The majority of the identified medically actionable findings were in individuals from the European (5/379) and Americas (4/181) ancestry groups, with fewer findings in Asian (2/286) and African (1/246) ancestry groups. Our results suggest that medically relevant secondary findings can be identified in approximately 1% (12/1092) of individuals in a diverse reference sample. As clinical sequencing laboratories continue to implement the ACMG recommendations, our results highlight that at least a small number of potentially important secondary findings can be selected for return. Our results also confirm that understudied populations will not reap proportionate benefits of genomic medicine, highlighting the need for continued research efforts on genetic diseases in these populations.

AB INTRODUCTION: The promise of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) has always been to transform patient care and improve patient outcomes through the delivery of timely and appropriate recommendations that are patient specific and, more often than not, are appropriately actionable. However, the users of CDS-providers-are frequently bombarded with inappropriate and inapplicable CDS that often are not informational, not integrated into the workflow, not patient specific, and that may present out of date and irrelevant recommendations.; METHODS: The integrated clinical prediction rule (iCPR) project was a randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted to determine if a novel form of CDS, i.e., clinical prediction rules (CPRs), could be efficiently integrated into workflow and result in changes in outcomes (e.g., antibiotic ordering) when embedded within a commercial electronic health record (EHR). We use the lessons learned from the iCPR project to illustrate a framework for constructing usable, useful, and effective actionable CDS while employing off-the-shelf functionality in a production system. Innovations that make up the framework combine the following: (1) active and actionable decision support, (2) multiple rounds of usability testing with iterative development for user acceptance, (3) numerous context sensitive triggers, (4) dedicated training and support for users of the CDS tool for user adoption, and (5) support from clinical and administrative leadership. We define "context sensitive triggers" as being workflow events (i.e., context) that result in a CDS intervention.; DISCUSSION: Success of the framework can be measured by CDS adoption (i.e., intervention is being used), acceptance (compliance with recommendations), and clinical outcomes (where appropriate). This framework may have broader implications for the deployment of Health Information Technology (HIT).; RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: iCPR was well adopted(57.4% of users) and accepted (42.7% of users). Usability testing identified and fixed many issues before the iCPR RCT. The level of leadership support and clinical guidance for iCPR was key in establishing a culture of acceptance for both the tool and its recommendations contributing to adoption and acceptance. The dedicated training and support lead to the majority of the residents reporting a high level of comfort with both iCPR tools strep pharyngitis (64.4 percent) and pneumonia (62.7 percent) as well as a high likelihood of using the tools in the future. A surprising framework addition resulted from usability testing: context sensitive triggers.

AB INTRODUCTION: The use of Clinical Prediction Rules (CPRs) has been advocated as one way of implementing actionable evidence-based rules in clinical practice. The current highly manual nature of deriving CPRs makes them difficult to use and maintain. Addressing the known limitations of CPRs requires implementing more flexible and dynamic models of CPR development. We describe the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to provide a platform for the derivation and dissemination of CPRs derived through analysis and continual learning from electronic patient data.; MODEL COMPONENTS: We propose a multistep maturity model for constructing electronic and computable CPRs (eCPRs). The model has six levels - from the lowest level of CPR maturity (literaturebased CPRs) to a fully electronic and computable service-oriented model of CPRs that are sensitive to specific demographic patient populations. We describe examples of implementations of the core model components - focusing on CPR representation, interoperability, electronic dissemination, CPR learning, and user interface requirements.; CONCLUSION: The traditional focus on derivation and narrow validation of CPRs has severely limited their wider acceptance. The evolution and maturity model described here outlines a progression toward eCPRs consistent with the vision of a learning health system (LHS) - using central repositories of CPR knowledge, accessible open standards, and generalizable models to avoid repetition of previous work. This is useful for developing more ambitious strategies to address limitations of the traditional CPR development life cycle. The model described here is a starting point for promoting discussion about what a more dynamic CPR development process should look like.

AB CONTEXT: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) awarded Denver Health's (DH) integrated, safety net health care system $19.8 million to implement a "population health" approach into the delivery of primary care. This major practice transformation builds on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) and Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) to achieve the "Triple Aim": improved health for populations, care to individuals, and lower per capita costs.; CASE DESCRIPTION: This paper presents a case study of how DH integrated published predictive models and front-line clinical judgment to implement a clinically actionable, risk stratification of patients. This population segmentation approach was used to deploy enhanced care team staff resources and to tailor care-management services to patient need, especially for patients at high risk of avoidable hospitalization. Developing, implementing, and gaining clinical acceptance of the Health Information Technology (HIT) solution for patient risk stratification was a major grant objective.; FINDINGS: In addition to describing the Information Technology (IT) solution itself, we focus on the leadership and organizational processes that facilitated its multidisciplinary development and ongoing iterative refinement, including the following: team composition, target population definition, algorithm rule development, performance assessment, and clinical-workflow optimization. We provide examples of how dynamic business intelligence tools facilitated clinical accessibility for program design decisions by enabling real-time data views from a population perspective down to patient-specific variables.; CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that population segmentation approaches that integrate clinical perspectives with predictive modeling results can better identify high opportunity patients amenable to medical home-based, enhanced care team interventions.

AB BACKGROUND: There are limited reports of the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) as a clinical diagnostic tool. Moreover, there are no reports addressing the cost burden associated with genetic tests performed prior to WES.; OBJECTIVE: We demonstrate the performance characteristics of WES in a pediatric setting by describing our patient cohort, calculating the diagnostic yield, and detailing the patients for whom clinical management was altered. Moreover, we examined the potential cost-effectiveness of WES by examining the cost burden of diagnostic workups.; METHODS: To determine the clinical utility of our hospital's clinical WES, we performed a retrospective review of the first 40 cases. We utilized dual bioinformatics analyses pipelines based on commercially available software and in-house tools.; RESULTS: Of the first 40 clinical cases, we identified genetic defects in 12 (30%) patients, of which 47% of the mutations were previously unreported in the literature. Among the 12 patients with positive findings, seven have autosomal dominant disease and five have autosomal recessive disease. Ninety percent of the cohort opted to receive secondary findings and of those, secondary medical actionable results were returned in three cases. Among these positive cases, there are a number of novel mutations that are being reported here. The diagnostic workup included a significant number of genetic tests with microarray and single-gene sequencing being the most popular tests. Significantly, genetic diagnosis from WES led to altered patient medical management in positive cases.; CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the clinical utility of WES by establishing the clinical diagnostic rate and its impact on medical management in a large pediatric center. The cost-effectiveness of WES was demonstrated by ending the diagnostic odyssey in positive cases. Also, in some cases it may be most cost-effective to directly perform WES. WES provides a unique glimpse into the complexity of genetic disorders.

AB The majority of hospital physiologic monitor alarms are not clinically actionable and contribute to alarm fatigue. In 2014, The Joint Commission declared alarm safety as a National Patient Safety Goal and urged prompt action by hospitals to mitigate the issue [1]. It has been demonstrated that vital signs in hospitalized children are quite different from currently accepted reference ranges [2]. Implementation of data-driven, age stratified vital sign parameters (Table 1) for alarms in this patient population could reduce alarm frequency.

AB The management of follow-up recommendations is fundamental for the appropriate care of patients with incidental pulmonary findings. The lack of communication of these important findings can result in important actionable information being lost in healthcare provider electronic documents. This study aims to analyze follow-up recommendations in radiology reports containing pulmonary incidental findings by using Natural Language Processing and Regular Expressions. Our evaluation highlights the different follow-up recommendation rates for oncology and non-oncology patient cohorts. The results reveal the need for a context-sensitive approach to tracking different patient cohorts in an enterprise-wide assessment.

AB BACKGROUND: In an effort to return actionable results from variant data to electronic health records (EHRs), participants in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network are being sequenced with the targeted Pharmacogenomics Research Network sequence platform (PGRNseq). This cost-effective, highly-scalable, and highly-accurate platform was created to explore rare variation in 84 key pharmacogenetic genes with strong drug phenotype associations.; METHODS: To return Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) results to our participants at the Group Health Cooperative, we sequenced the DNA of 900 participants (61 % female) with non-CLIA biobanked samples. We then selected 450 of those to be re-consented, to redraw blood, and ultimately to validate CLIA variants in anticipation of returning the results to the participant and EHR. These 450 were selected using an algorithm we designed to harness data from self-reported race, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical notes, laboratory results, and variant-level bioinformatics to ensure selection of an informative sample. We annotated the multi-sample variant call format by a combination of SeattleSeq and SnpEff tools, with additional custom variables including evidence from ClinVar, OMIM, HGMD, and prior clinical associations.; RESULTS: We focused our analyses on 27 actionable genes, largely driven by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium. We derived a ranking system based on the total number of coding variants per participant (75.2±14.7), and the number of coding variants with high or moderate impact (11.5±3.9). Notably, we identified 11 stop-gained (1 %) and 519 missense (20 %) variants out of a total of 1785 in these 27 genes. Finally, we prioritized variants to be returned to the EHR with prior clinical evidence of pathogenicity or annotated as stop-gain for the following genes: CACNA1S and RYR1 (malignant hyperthermia); SCN5A, KCNH2, and RYR2 (arrhythmia); and LDLR (high cholesterol).; CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of genetics into the EHR for clinical decision support is a complex undertaking for many reasons including lack of prior consent for return of results, lack of biospecimens collected in a CLIA environment, and EHR integration. Our study design accounts for these hurdles and is an example of a pilot system that can be utilized before expanding to an entire health system.

AB We previously reported that oncogenic KRAS activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway stimulates the remaining wild-type HRAS and NRAS proteins in a manner dependent upon both eNOS expression and C118 in HRAS and NRAS, which promoted tumor growth. Interestingly however, we recently found that loss of wild-type HRAS, NRAS, and even more potently, loss of both of these genes actually enhanced oncogenic KRAS-driven early tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that wild-type RAS proteins are tumor suppressing early in tumorigenesis, but tumor promoting in more malignant settings. Knock-in of a C118S mutation into an endogenous wild-type RAS gene did not, however, hamper oncogenic KRAS-driven tumor initiation. As such, redox-dependent reactions with C118 of wild-type RAS proteins are unlikely to be responsible for the tumor suppressive role of wild-type RAS proteins. This suggests that the redox-dependent reactions with C118 of wild-type RAS proteins are more important in more malignant settings. Given this, it stands to reason that inhibiting redox-dependent reactions like S-nitrosylation of wild-type RAS proteins may be more effective in established cancer settings. Indeed, we find that in three different models of KRAS-driven cancers-skin, pancreatic and lung- the general NOS inhibitor l-NAME reduced tumor burden and/or extended the lifespan of mice. Since oncogenic RAS has so far proven refractory to pharmacologic inhibition, targeting NOS activity may be an actionable approach to inhibiting RAS signaling for the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers.

AB Liposarcomas are one the most common of over 50 histologic subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas that are mostly resistant to chemotherapy. Histologically, liposarcomas themselves are heterogeneous and fall into four distinct subtypes: well-differentiated/atypical lipomatous tumor, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid (round cell) liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Surgical resection with negative margins remains the mainstay for definitive treatment for operable disease. For unresectable disease, retrospective studies have identified myxoid (round cell) and pleomorphic sarcomas to be relatively responsive to chemotherapy. Recent studies have identified distinct genetic aberrations that not only aid in the diagnosis of particular liposarcoma subtypes, but represent actionable targets as they are considered central to disease pathogenesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) are overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas and offer tantalizing opportunities that are being pursued in clinical trials. Myxoid (round cell) liposarcomas appear to be sensitive to trabectedin, which is currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. Liposarcomas do not represent a uniform disease and understanding the underlying molecular mechanism will help not only in accurate diagnosis but in selecting the appropriate treatment.

AB Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Over the last decade, significant advances have been made in the molecular characterization of this tumor group, identifying predictive biomarkers or molecular actionable targets, and paving the way to molecular-based targeted therapies. This personalized therapeutic approach is effective and illustrated in the present review. Among many molecular abnormalities, BRAF mutation and mTOR activation in pilocytic astrocytomas and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are actionable targets sensitive to vemurafenib and everolimus, respectively. Chromosome arms 1p/19q co-deletion and IDH mutational status are pivotal in driving delivery of early procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. Although consensus to assess MGMT promoter methylation is not reached yet, it may be useful in predicting resistance to temozolomide in elderly patients.

AB Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that necessitates proper patient classification to direct surgery, pharmacotherapy, and radiotherapy. Despite patients within the same subgroup receiving similar pharmacotherapy, substantial variation in clinical outcomes is observed. Pharmacogenetic variations with direct effect on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics play a central role in clinical outcomes. Pharmacogenetic markers associated with clinical outcome are known as biomarkers. They are termed prognostic biomarkers when their presence is associated with a specific clinical outcome. If the presence of such biomarkers guides treatment, they are termed predictive biomarkers. A number of pharmacogenetic markers have been described in relation to breast cancer pharmacotherapy both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. CYP2D6 allelic variants produce variable rates of tamoxifen metabolism and are associated with survival outcomes. Other biomarkers have been described in relation to other forms of endocrine therapy and trastuzumab. In neoadjuvant and adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy, specific biomarkers were correlated with clinical outcomes and risk of drug toxicity. This review highlights key biomarkers in breast cancer pharmacotherapy with the potential of translating such study outcomes into clinical practice.

AB As a result of their practice of medicine, forensic pathologists create a wealth of data regarding the causes of and reasons for sudden, unexpected or violent deaths. This data have been effectively used to protect the health and safety of the general public in a variety of ways despite current and historical limitations. These limitations include the lack of data standards between the thousands of death investigation (DI) systems in the United States, rudimentary electronic information systems for DI, and the lack of effective communications and interfaces between these systems. Collaboration between forensic pathology and clinical informatics is required to address these shortcomings and a path forward has been proposed that will enable forensic pathology to maximize its effectiveness by providing timely and actionable information to public health and public safety agencies.

AB Choroidal metastasis is rare in cancer patients. Small molecules of molecular targeted agents for lung cancer with actionable mutations were reported to be palliated for symptoms caused by choroidal metastasis. Visual disturbance by choroidal metastasis significantly decreases quality of life during the patient's remaining lifespan; therefore, radiotherapy or laser photocoagulation is proposed with consensus. However, improvement in survival with matched molecular targeted agents for oncogenic driver mutations reminds us to also be concerned with late treatment toxicities. A 30-year-old female patient previously treated with crizotinib harboring ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer complained of visual disturbance, fever, and bone pains undergoing anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. A decreased proportion of ALK fusion was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization in liver metastasis compared to the primary site in a chemo-naive state. She was diagnosed with low vision, choroidal metastasis and retinal detachment. Therefore, she started alectinib treatment and both her ocular and systemic symptoms were palliated in a week. Later, she temporarily discontinued alectinib because of skin rash although the choroidal metastasis and retinal detachment resolved and she regained low vision completely at 2 weeks. She obtained partial response with alectinib for more than 5 months after recovering from skin rash.

AB Clinical use of genetic testing to predict adult onset conditions allows individuals to minimize or circumvent disease when preventive medical interventions are available. Recent policy recommendations and changes expand patient access to information about asymptomatic genetic conditions and create mechanisms for expanded insurance coverage for genetic tests. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that laboratories provide incidental findings of medically actionable genetic variants after whole genome sequencing. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) established mechanisms to mandate coverage for genetic tests, such as BRCA. The ACA and ACMG, however, do not address insurance coverage for preventive interventions. These policies equate access to testing as access to prevention, without exploring the accessibility and affordability of interventions. In reality, insurance coverage for preventive interventions in asymptomatic adults is variable given the US health insurance system's focus on treatment. Health disparities will be exacerbated if only privileged segments of society can access preventive interventions, such as prophylactic surgeries, screenings, or medication. To ensure equitable access to interventions, federal or state legislatures should mandate insurance coverage for both predictive genetic testing and recommended follow-up interventions included in a list established by an expert panel or regulatory body.

AB BACKGROUND: Conventional bacterial stool culture is one of the more time-consuming tests in a routine clinical microbiology laboratory. In addition, less than 5% of stool cultures yield positive results. A molecular platform, the BD MAX System (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) offers the potential for significantly more rapid results and less hands-on time. Time-motion analysis of the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel (EBP) (BD Diagnostics, Quebec, Canada) on the BD MAX System was compared to conventional stool culture in the microbiology laboratory of a tertiary care pediatric hospital.; METHODS: The process impact analysis of time-motion studies of conventional cultures were compared to those of EBP with 86 stool specimens. Sample flow, hands-on time, processing steps, and overall turnaround time were determined and analyzed. Data were obtained and analyzed from both standard operating procedures and direct observation. A regression analysis was performed to ensure consistency of measurements. Time and process measurements started when the specimens were logged into the accessioning area of the microbiology laboratory and were completed when actionable results were generated.; RESULTS: With conventional culture, negative culture results were available from 41:14:27 (hours:minutes:seconds) to 54:17:19; with EBP, positive and negative results were available from 2:28:40 to 3:33:39.; CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the suggestion that use of the EBP to detect commonly encountered stool pathogens can result in significant time savings and a shorter time-to-result for patients with acute bacterial diarrhea.

AB BACKGROUND: NCCN states that chemotherapies for advanced esophageal and gastric cancers may be used interchangeably. Biomarkers from gastroesophageal cancer patients were interrogated to identify actionable alterations with therapeutic implications.; METHODS: 666 gastric and 640 esophageal cancer cases referred to Caris Life Sciences between 2009 thru 2013 were evaluated. Specific testing was performed, which included a combination of sequencing (Sanger, NGS) and protein expression (IHC).; RESULTS: In the complete cohort (n = 1306), 30 of 45 genes tested harbored mutations; highest rates were seen in TP53 (54%), APC (10%), SMAD4 (5.9%), KRAS (5.9%), and PIK3CA (5.1%). IHC of TOP2A was high in 76% of cases, TOPO1 in 51% and SPARC in 25%; low IHC of ERCC1 was seen in 65%, RRM1 in 62%, TS in 61% and MGMT in 45%, indicating potential benefit from epirubicin, irinotecan, nab-paclitaxel, platinum-based agents, gemcitabine, 5FU/capecitabine and temozolomide, respectively. In the HER2+ cohort (n = 88), 50% of patients demonstrated possible benefit from a combination of trastuzumab with 5FU/capecitabine based on concurrent low TS, 53% with irinotecan (high TOPO1), 63% with cisplatin (low ERCC1) and 55% with gemcitabine (low RRM1). Subgroup analysis by tumor origin demonstrated significant differences in actionable biomarker profiles with HER2 (13% vs. 4.6%), SPARC (34% vs. 15%), TOP2A (86% vs. 67%), and TOPO1 (55% vs. 46%) in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma cases respectively (P < 0.05).; CONCLUSION: A comprehensive multiplatform biomarker analysis suggested significant biomarker differences between gastric and esophageal cancers. These results can assist in the development of future clinical trials.

We will improve this by developing new QIs that are actionable, reliable, valid and easy to register. Using a modified RAND technique we developed in three rounds new QIs for blood use at Dutch intensive care units (ICUs). The final set of QIs will be part of the National Intensive Care Evaluation quality registry and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. In addition, a web-based feedback tool containing strategies for quality improvement will be developed. With the results of this project we hope to improve and maintain good quality of care at the Dutch ICUs .

AB In recent years, advances in sensor technology, connectedness and computational power have come together to produce huge data-sets. The treatment and analysis of these data-sets is known as big data analytics (BDA), and the somewhat related term data mining. Fields allied to human factors/ergonomics (HFE), e.g. statistics, have developed computational methods to derive meaningful, actionable conclusions from these data bases. This paper examines BDA, often characterised by volume, velocity and variety, giving examples of successful BDA use. This examination provides context by considering examples of using BDA on human data, using BDA in HFE studies, and studies of how people perform BDA. Significant issues for HFE are the reliance of BDA on correlation rather than hypotheses and theory, the ethics of BDA and the use of HFE in data visualisation.

AB Reducing the burden of emerging and endemic infectious diseases on commercial livestock production systems will require the development of innovative technology platforms that enable information from diverse animal health resources to be collected, analyzed, and communicated in near real-time. In this paper, we review recent initiatives to leverage data routinely observed by farmers, production managers, veterinary practitioners, diagnostic laboratories, regulatory officials, and slaughterhouse inspectors for disease surveillance purposes. The most commonly identified challenges were (1) the lack of standardized systems for recording essential data elements within and between surveillance data streams, (2) the additional time required to collect data elements that are not routinely recorded by participants, (3) the concern over the sharing and use of business sensitive information with regulatory authorities and other data analysts, (4) the difficulty in developing sustainable incentives to maintain long-term program participation, and (5) the limitations in current methods for analyzing and reporting animal health information in a manner that facilitates actionable response. With the significant recent advances in information science, there are many opportunities to develop more sophisticated systems that meet national disease surveillance objectives, while still providing participants with valuable tools and feedback to manage routine animal health concerns.

AB BACKGROUND: Brainstem gliomas are rare in adults and overall have superior survival outcomes compared to pediatric brainstem gliomas.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data and tissue analysis of all adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II, III, and IV brainstem gliomas in the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional database from 1990 to 2012.; RESULTS: We identified 143 cases in adults ages 18 and over. There were 28 glioblastomas, 43 anaplastic astrocytomas, 15 diffuse astrocytomas, and 11 gliomas not otherwise specified, and in 46 cases the diagnosis was made radiographically. 128 (89.5%) cases were classified radiographically as diffuse and of the focal tumors, 9 of the 15 were WHO Grade III or IV tumors. Increasing tumor grade and contrast enhancement were associated with significantly reduced overall survival. The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 32.1 months similar to previously published studies. Two of 25 grade II and III tumors, and 1 of 17 glioblastomas had IDH1 mutations on immunohistochemical testing. Nine cases had sufficient tissue for mutation profiling, 1 case had a BRAF V600E mutation and 2 had 2 PIK3CA mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Survival outcomes for adult WHO Grade II to IV brainstem gliomas were similar to supratentorial IDH1 wild-type tumors of similar grade and histology. Potentially actionable mutations can be identified from small biopsy samples in a subset of adult brainstem gliomas. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that there is value in examining cancers for genomic aberrations via next-generation sequencing (NGS). How commercially available NGS platforms compare with each other, and the clinical utility of the reported actionable results, are not well known. During the course of the current study, the Foundation One (F1) test generated data on a combination of somatic mutations, insertion and deletion polymorphisms, chromosomal abnormalities, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy number changes at ~250* coverage, while the Paradigm Cancer Diagnostic (PCDx) test generated the same type of data at >5,000* coverage, plus provided messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels. We sought to compare and evaluate paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue using these two platforms.; METHODS: Samples from patients with advanced solid tumors were submitted to both the F1 and PCDx vendors for NGS analysis. Turnaround time (TAT) was calculated. Biomarkers were considered clinically actionable if they had a published association with treatment response in humans and were assigned to the following categories: commercially available drug (CA), clinical trial drug (CT), or neither option (hereafter referred to as "None").; RESULTS: The demographics of the 21 unique patient tumor samples included ten men and eleven women, with a median age of 56 years. Due to insufficient archival tissue from the same collection period, in one case, we used samples from different collections. PCDx reported first results faster than F1 in 20 cases. When received at both vendors on the same day, PCDx reported first results for 14 of 15 cases, with a median TAT of 9 days earlier than F1 (P<0.0001). Categorization of CA compared to CT and none significantly favored PCDx (P=0.012).; CONCLUSION: In the current analysis, commercially available NGS platforms provided clinically relevant actionable targets (CA or CT) in 47%-67% of diverse cancer types. In the samples analyzed, PCDx significantly outperformed F1 in TAT, and had statistically significant higher clinically relevant actionable targets categorized as CA.

AB INTRODUCTION: Elder abuse, a universal human rights problem, is associated with many negative consequences. In most jurisdictions, however, there are no comprehensive hospital-based interventions for elder abuse that address the totality of needs of abused older adults: psychological, physical, legal, and social. As the first step towards the development of such an intervention, we undertook a systematic scoping review.; OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to systematically extract and synthesize actionable and applicable recommendations for components of a multidisciplinary intersectoral hospital-based elder abuse intervention. A secondary objective was to summarize the characteristics of the responses reviewed, including methods of development and validation.; METHODS: The grey and scholarly literatures were systematically searched, with two independent reviewers conducting the title, abstract and full text screening. Documents were considered eligible for inclusion if they: 1) addressed a response (e.g., an intervention) to elder abuse, 2) contained recommendations for responding to abused older adults with potential relevance to a multidisciplinary and intersectoral hospital-based elder abuse intervention; and 3) were available in English.; ANALYSIS: The extracted recommendations for care were collated, coded, categorized into themes, and further reviewed for relevancy to a comprehensive hospital-based response. Characteristics of the responses were summarized using descriptive statistics.; RESULTS: 649 recommendations were extracted from 68 distinct elder abuse responses, 149 of which were deemed relevant and were categorized into 5 themes: Initial contact; Capacity and consent; Interview with older adult, caregiver, collateral contacts, and/or suspected abuser;; ASSESSMENT: physical/forensic, mental, psychosocial, and environmental/functional; and care plan. Only 6 responses had been evaluated, suggesting a significant gap between development and implementation of recommendations.; DISCUSSION: To address the lack of evidence to support the recommendations extracted in this review, in a future study, a group of experts will formally evaluate each recommendation for its inclusion in a comprehensive hospital-based response.

AB INTRODUCTION: Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 calls for reducing mortality of children under-five years by two-thirds by 2015. Indonesia is on track to officially meet the MDG 4 targets by 2015 but progress has been far from universal. It has been argued that national level statistics, on which MDG 4 relies, obscure persistent health inequities within the country. Particularly inequities in child health are a major global public health challenge both for achieving MDG 4 in 2015 and beyond. This review aims to map out the situation of MDG 4 with respect to disadvantaged populations in Indonesia applying the Social Determinants of Health (SDH) framework. The specific objectives are to answer: Who are the disadvantaged populations? Where do they live? And why and how is the inequitable distribution of health explained in terms of the SDH framework?; METHODS AND FINDINGS: We retrieved studies through a systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature published in 1995-2014. The PRISMA-Equity 2012 statement was adapted to guide the methods of this review. The dependent variables were MDG 4-related indicators; the independent variable "disadvantaged populations" was defined by different categories of social differentiation using PROGRESS. Included texts were analyzed following the guidelines for deductive content analysis operationalized on the basis of the SDH framework. We identified 83 studies establishing evidence on more than 40 different determinants hindering an equitable distribution of child health in Indonesia. The most prominent determinants arise from the shortcomings within the rural health care system, the repercussions of food poverty coupled with low health literacy among parents, the impact of low household decision-making power of mothers, and the consequences of high persistent use of traditional birth attendants among ethnic minorities.; CONCLUSION: This review calls for enhanced understanding of the determinants and pathways that create, detain, and overcome inequities in child health in resource constraint settings like Indonesia and the promotion of actionable health policy recommendations and tailored investments.

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive, malignant brain tumor typically resulting in death of the patient within one year following diagnosis; and those who survive beyond this point usually present with tumor recurrence within two years (5-year survival is 5%). The genetic heterogeneity of GBM has made the molecular characterization of these tumors an area of great interest and has led to identification of molecular subtypes in GBM. The availability of sequencing platforms that are both fast and economical can further the adoption of tumor sequencing in the clinical environment, potentially leading to identification of clinically actionable genetic targets. In this pilot study, comprised of triplet samples of normal blood, primary tumor, and recurrent tumor samples from three patients; we compared the ability of Illumina whole exome sequencing (ExomeSeq) and the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel (CCP) to identify somatic variants in patient-paired primary and recurrent tumor samples. Thirteen genes were found to harbor variants, the majority of which were exclusive to the ExomeSeq data. Surprisingly, only two variants were identified by both platforms and they were located within the PTCH1 and NF1 genes. Although preliminary in nature, this work highlights major differences in variant identification in data generated from the two platforms. Additional studies with larger samples sizes are needed to further explore the differences between these technologies and to enhance our understanding of the clinical utility of panel based platforms in genomic profiling of brain tumors.

AB To construct a profile of therapeutically actionable gene alterations in the major histological types of ovarian cancer, 72 Japanese patients with surgically resected ovarian cancers were selected from an original cohort consisting of 267 patients who had not received pre-treatment before surgery. Somatic mutations and copy number alterations at 740 hotspots in 46 cancer-related genes were detected by deep sequencing of genomic DNAs obtained from snap-frozen tumor tissues using a next generation sequencer. The alterations were verified by Sanger sequencing and quantitative genomic PCR. Mutations and/or copy number aberrations which will make tumors respond to molecular targeting drugs were detected in nine genes of 35/72 (48.6%) patients; PIK3CA (25.0%), KRAS (13.9%), ERBB2 (4.3%), PTEN (2.8%), RB1 (2.8%), CDKN2A (2.8%), AKT1 (1.4%), CTNNB1 (1.4%) and NRAS (1.4%). These mutations tended to occur in a mutually exclusive manner. Non-serous histological type tumors showed such actionable gene alterations frequently (32/47; 68.1%). Therefore, ovarian cancers, particularly of non-serous types, frequently carry gene aberrations that link to therapy using molecular targeting drugs.

AB At present, a radical shift in cancer treatment is occurring in terms of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM). Individual patients will participate in more aspects of their healthcare. During the development of PPPM, many rapid, specific, and sensitive new methods for earlier detection of cancer will result in more efficient management of the patient and hence a better quality of life. Coordination of the various activities among different healthcare professionals in primary, secondary, and tertiary care requires well-defined competencies, implementation of training and educational programs, sharing of data, and harmonized guidelines. In this position paper, the current knowledge to understand cancer predisposition and risk factors, the cellular biology of cancer, predictive markers and treatment outcome, the improvement in technologies in screening and diagnosis, and provision of better drug development solutions are discussed in the context of a better implementation of personalized medicine. Recognition of the major risk factors for cancer initiation is the key for preventive strategies (EPMA J. 4(1):6, 2013). Of interest, cancer predisposing syndromes in particular the monogenic subtypes that lead to cancer progression are well defined and one should focus on implementation strategies to identify individuals at risk to allow preventive measures and early screening/diagnosis. Implementation of such measures is disturbed by improper use of the data, with breach of data protection as one of the risks to be heavily controlled. Population screening requires in depth cost-benefit analysis to justify healthcare costs, and the parameters screened should provide information that allow an actionable and deliverable solution, for better healthcare provision.

AB Haplotypes are often critical for the interpretation of genetic laboratory observations into medically actionable findings. Current massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies produce short sequence reads that are often unable to resolve haplotype information. Phasing short read data typically requires supplemental statistical phasing based on known haplotype structure in the population or parental genotypic data. Here we demonstrate that the MinION nanopore sequencer is capable of producing very long reads to resolve both variants and haplotypes of HLA-A, HLA-B and CYP2D6 genes important in determining patient drug response in sample NA12878 of CEPH/UTAH pedigree 1463, without the need for statistical phasing. Long read data from a single 24-hour nanopore sequencing run was used to reconstruct haplotypes, which were confirmed by HapMap data and statistically phased Complete Genomics and Sequenom genotypes. Our results demonstrate that nanopore sequencing is an emerging standalone technology with potential utility in a clinical environment to aid in medical decision-making.

AB PURPOSE: Frameworks highlighting disease actionability and severity are evolving to address the need to organize results from genome-wide analyses. This approach represents a paradigm shift from consultations focused on one or more genes to multiple genes for multiple disorders. Empirical input from the general population is lacking, yet seems essential for understanding how to maximize patient autonomy and satisfaction in the decision-making process.; METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with a representative sample of 900 US adults and assessed the participants' perceptions and attitudes toward disease actionability and severity, ranking hypothetical scenarios for these properties, and explored correlations with interest in learning test results.; RESULTS: Most respondents (>85%) rated actionability and severity as useful concepts; 46.6% indicated actionability alone would be adequate for decision making. Over half of them (53.8%) reported being very/extremely confident in their ability to score for actionability and severity. The participants' scoring of medical scenarios varied significantly between individuals. Scores for severity but not actionability were correlated with interest in learning genetic results. Subsets of the respondents projected wanting all results (30%) or no results (16%). The use of expert-created lists was acceptable to 43%.; CONCLUSIONS: The respondents from the general population were confident in making their own decisions. The responses suggested different priorities than current expert-driven approaches. The emphasis on binning genes may be missing a complementary, simplifying approach of grouping patients based upon their all/none interest in genomic results. This study illuminates important differences between the general public and genetic experts. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB OBJECTIVES: To explore actionable information that can be used to reduce hospital acute care length of stay (LOS) and to assess racial and income disparities in LOS in an integrated healthcare network.; STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 8718 inpatients in an integrated healthcare network. The LOS was examined by using linear, log-linear, Poisson, generalized Poisson, and negative binomial (NB) models to control for confounding factors. The performances of the 5 models were compared, and the NB model was selected for the final analysis and report.; RESULTS: Over 50% of the inpatients were not married. The LOS was 22% longer for the unmarried patients compared with their married counterparts after controlling for confounding factors. No income or racial disparities were found.; CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged LOS of the unmarried patients and the potential lack of post discharge care support warrant greater attention from discharge planners at hospital level and from policy makers at both the national and local levels. Racial and income disparities are not unavoidable; the way in which care is paid for and delivered may play a role.

AB We have developed an informatics system, GeneMed, for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) molecular profiling-based assignment of cancer therapy (MPACT) clinical trial (NCT01827384) being conducted in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. This trial is one of the first to use a randomized design to examine whether assigning treatment based on genomic tumor screening can improve the rate and duration of response in patients with advanced solid tumors. An analytically validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay is applied to DNA from patients' tumors to identify mutations in a panel of genes that are thought likely to affect the utility of targeted therapies available for use in the clinical trial. The patients are randomized to a treatment selected to target a somatic mutation in the tumor or with a control treatment. The GeneMed system streamlines the workflow of the clinical trial and serves as a communications hub among the sequencing lab, the treatment selection team, and clinical personnel. It automates the annotation of the genomic variants identified by sequencing, predicts the functional impact of mutations, identifies the actionable mutations, and facilitates quality control by the molecular characterization lab in the review of variants. The GeneMed system collects baseline information about the patients from the clinic team to determine eligibility for the panel of drugs available. The system performs randomized treatment assignments under the oversight of a supervising treatment selection team and generates a patient report containing detected genomic alterations. NCI is planning to expand the MPACT trial to multiple cancer centers soon. In summary, the GeneMed system has been proven to be an efficient and successful informatics hub for coordinating the reliable application of NGS to precision medicine studies.

AB PURPOSE: Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) is being widely promoted in healthcare settings to train staff in evidence-based approaches that promote patient safety. It involves a comprehensive curriculum that spells out key principles and actionable tools for a culture change toward patient-safety-focussed teamwork. Activities begin with selected personnel attending TeamSTEPPS Master Trainer Training (MTT) and then organizing and providing TeamSTEPPS training for staff in their organization. The authors conducted interviews with respondents at community hospitals conducting TeamSTEPPS staff training. To structure the interviews, the authors used 11 key questions identified by Weaver et al. in their in-depth team training literature review. The purpose of this paper is to examine approaches taken by community hospital personnel and compare those to the best practices recommended by Weaver et al.; DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors interviewed 57 staff and administrators at 22 community hospitals sending teams to TeamSTEPPS MTT.; FINDINGS: The authors find that training implementation in community hospitals differs significantly from the established, research-based principles for effective team training described in the research literature, which is largely based in academic medical centers.; ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The current findings suggest that several TeamSTEPPS training features could be enhanced in community hospitals including: choosing staff who have the skills to be effective trainers in this train-the-trainer model; emphasizing active learning; and sustaining lessons through on-the-job application, practice and feedback. These principles apply to many training approaches employed in small healthcare organizations.

AB Pediatric malignancies in adults, in contrast to the same diseases in children are clinically more aggressive, resistant to chemotherapeutics, and carry a higher risk of relapse. Molecular profiling of tumor sample using next generation sequencing (NGS) has recently become clinically available. We report the results of targeted exome sequencing of six adult patients with pediatric-type malignancies : Wilms tumor(n=2), medulloblastoma(n=2), Ewing's sarcoma( n=1) and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (n=1) with a median age of 28.8 years. Detection of druggable somatic aberrations in tumors is feasible. However, identification of actionable target therapies in these rare adult patients with pediatric-type malignancies is challenging. Continuous efforts to establish a rare disease registry are warranted.

AB BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UC) is a common malignancy. Although extensive transcriptome analysis has provided insights into the gene expression patterns of this tumor type, the mechanistic underpinnings of differential methylation remain poorly understood. Multi-level genomic data may be used to profile the regulatory potential and landscape of differential methylation in cancer and gain understanding of the processes underlying epigenetic and phenotypic characteristics of tumors.; METHODS: We perform genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 98 gene-expression subtyped tumors to identify between-tumor differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We integrate multi-level publically available genomic data generated by the ENCODE consortium to characterize the regulatory potential of UC DMRs.; RESULTS: We identify 5,453 between-tumor DMRs and derive four DNA methylation subgroups of UC with distinct associations to clinicopathological features and gene expression subtypes. We characterize three distinct patterns of differential methylation and use ENCODE data to show that tumor subgroup-defining DMRs display differential chromatin state, and regulatory factor binding preferences. Finally, we characterize an epigenetic switch involving the HOXA-genes with associations to tumor differentiation states and patient prognosis.; CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide DMR methylation patterns are reflected in the gene expression subtypes of UC. UC DMRs display three distinct methylation patterns, each associated with intrinsic features of the genome and differential regulatory factor binding preferences. Epigenetic inactivation of HOX-genes correlates with tumor differentiation states and may present an actionable epigenetic alteration in UC.

AB INTRODUCTION: Teamwork is a basic component of all health care, and substantial research links the quality of teamwork to safety and quality of care. The TEAM (Teamwork Effectiveness Assessment Module) is a new Web-based teamwork assessment module for practicing hospital physicians. The module combines self-assessment, multisource feedback from members of other professions and specialties with whom the physician exercises teamwork, and a structured review of those data with a peer to develop an improvement plan.; METHODS: We conducted a pilot test of this module with hospitalist physicians to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of the module in practice, focusing on these specific questions: Would physicians in hospitals of different types and sizes be able to use the module; would the providers identified as raters respond to the request for feedback; would the physicians be able to identify one or more "trusted peers" to help analyze the feedback; and how would physicians experience the module process overall?; RESULTS: 20 of 25 physicians who initially volunteered for the pilot completed all steps of the TEAM, including identifying interprofessional teammates, soliciting feedback from their team, and identifying a peer to help review data. Module users described the feedback they received as helpful and actionable, and indicated this was information they would not have otherwise received.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a module combining self-assessment, multisource feedback, and a guided process for interpreting these data can provide help practicing hospital physicians to understand and potentially improve their interprofessional teamwork skills and behaviors. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Advanced bladder cancer (ABC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. For the last 30 years, the standard of care for this disease has consisted of combination chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen as first-line therapy. Cisplatin is the most active cytotoxic agent against bladder cancer, but because of competing comorbidities, many patients are ineligible for this agent and instead receive carboplatin. The two-drug regimen of cisplatin and gemcitabine was found to be better tolerated and have comparable efficacy as the four-drug regimen of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) in a randomized study of patients with advanced disease. Therefore, cisplatin (or carboplatin) and gemcitabine is the most commonly used first-line regimen in this setting. No agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for second-line therapy in ABC. If patients are eligible for additional systemic treatment at the time of progression, options include single-agent therapy such as a taxane or pemetrexed, though given the lack of standard approaches participation in a clinical trial should be strongly encouraged. Recent molecular characterization of ABC reveals significant genetic heterogeneity and actionable genomic alterations in the majority of tumors. Emerging therapies may effectively target known molecular drivers of ABC, including the FGFR2, EGFR/HER2, VEGF, MET, and PI3/AKT/mTOR pathways. Reports of dramatic and prolonged responses to targeted therapy provide additional support for the use of genome sequencing in the rationale selection of treatment for subsets of patients. The current focus of clinical trial development is to design molecularly driven studies that "match" tumors with driver mutations and appropriate targeted therapies rather than a "one-size-fits-all" approach based on clinical and pathologic parameters of disease. The hope of patients and clinicians alike is that this therapeutic approach combined with novel agents may usher in a new era of effective treatments for patients with ABC.

AB BACKGROUND: Breast cancer exhibits significant molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Current clinicopathological evaluation is imperfect for predicting outcome, which results in overtreatment for many patients, and for others, leads to death from recurrent disease. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to better personalize care and maximize treatment effectiveness and survival.; METHODS: To address these challenges, the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) consortium was initiated in 2010 as a multicenter prospective study with longsighted aims to analyze breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research in a population-based manner and integrated with healthcare; decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; utilize genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and establish real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. In the first phase, we focus on molecular profiling by next-generation RNA-sequencing on the Illumina platform.; RESULTS: In the first 3years from 30 August 2010 through 31 August 2013, we have consented and enrolled 3,979 patients with primary breast cancer at the seven hospital sites in South Sweden, representing approximately 85% of eligible patients in the catchment area. Preoperative blood samples have been collected for 3,942 (99%) patients and primary tumor specimens collected for 2,929 (74%) patients. Herein we describe the study infrastructure and protocols and present initial proof of concept results from prospective RNA sequencing including tumor molecular subtyping and detection of driver gene mutations. Prospective patient enrollment is ongoing.; CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that large-scale population-based collection and RNA-sequencing analysis of breast cancer is feasible. The SCAN-B Initiative should significantly reduce the time to discovery, validation, and clinical implementation of novel molecular diagnostic and predictive tests. We welcome the participation of additional comprehensive cancer treatment centers.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02306096.

AB The ability to rapidly sequence the tumor and germline DNA of an individual holds the eventual promise of revolutionizing our ability to match targeted therapies to tumors harboring the associated genetic biomarkers. Analyzing high throughput genomic data consisting of millions of base pairs and discovering alterations in clinically actionable genes in a structured and real time manner is at the crux of personalized testing. This requires a computational architecture that can monitor and track a system within a regulated environment as terabytes of data are reduced to a small number of therapeutically relevant variants, delivered as a diagnostic laboratory developed test. These high complexity assays require data structures that enable real-time and retrospective ad-hoc analysis, with a capability of updating to keep up with the rapidly changing genomic and therapeutic options, all under a regulated environment that is relevant under both CMS and FDA depending on application. We describe a flexible computational framework that uses a paired tumor/normal sample allowing for complete analysis and reporting in approximately 24 hours, providing identification of single nucleotide changes, small insertions and deletions, chromosomal rearrangements, gene fusions and gene expression with positive predictive values over 90%. In this paper we present the challenges in integrating clinical, genomic and annotation databases to provide interpreted draft reports which we utilize within ongoing clinical research protocols. We demonstrate the need to retire from existing performance measurements of accuracy and specificity and measure metrics that are meaningful to a genomic diagnostic environment. This paper presents a three-tier infrastructure that is currently being used to analyze an individual genome and provide available therapeutic options via a clinical report. Our framework utilizes a non-relational variant-centric database that is scaleable to a large amount of data and addresses the challenges and limitations of a relational database system. Our system is continuously monitored via multiple trackers each catering differently to the diversity of users involved in this process. These trackers designed in analytics web-app framework provide status updates for an individual sample accurate to a few minutes. In this paper, we also present our outcome delivery process that is designed and delivered adhering to the standards defined by various regulation agencies involved in clinical genomic testing.

AB UNLABELLED: There is an urgent need in oncology to link molecular aberrations in tumors with therapeutics that can be administered in a personalized fashion. One approach identifies synthetic-lethal genetic interactions or dependencies that cancer cells acquire in the presence of specific mutations. Using engineered isogenic cells, we generated a systematic and quantitative chemical-genetic interaction map that charts the influence of 51 aberrant cancer genes on 90 drug responses. The dataset strongly predicts drug responses found in cancer cell line collections, indicating that isogenic cells can model complex cellular contexts. Applying this dataset to triple-negative breast cancer, we report clinically actionable interactions with the MYC oncogene, including resistance to AKT-PI3K pathway inhibitors and an unexpected sensitivity to dasatinib through LYN inhibition in a synthetic lethal manner, providing new drug and biomarker pairs for clinical investigation. This scalable approach enables the prediction of drug responses from patient data and can accelerate the development of new genotype-directed therapies.; SIGNIFICANCE: Determining how the plethora of genomic abnormalities that exist within a given tumor cell affects drug responses remains a major challenge in oncology. Here, we develop a new mapping approach to connect cancer genotypes to drug responses using engineered isogenic cell lines and demonstrate how the resulting dataset can guide clinical interrogation. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Precision medicine is dependent on identifying actionable mutations in tumors. Accurate detection of mutations is often problematic in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues is fragmented and also contains DNA lesions that are the sources of sequence artifacts. Sequence artifacts can be difficult to distinguish from true mutations, especially in the context of tumor heterogeneity, and are an increasing interpretive problem in this era of massively parallel sequencing. Understanding of the sources of sequence artifacts in FFPE tissues and implementation of preventative strategies are critical to improve the accurate detection of actionable mutations.; CONTENT: This mini-review focuses on DNA template lesions in FFPE tissues as the source of sequence artifacts in molecular analysis. In particular, fragmentation, base modification (including uracil and thymine deriving from cytosine deamination), and abasic sites are discussed as indirect or direct sources of sequence artifacts. We discuss strategies that can be implemented to minimize sequence artifacts and to distinguish true mutations from sequence artifacts. These strategies are applicable for the detection of actionable mutations in both single amplicon and massively parallel amplicon sequencing approaches.; SUMMARY: Because FFPE tissues are usually the only available material for DNA analysis, it is important to maximize the accurate informational content from FFPE DNA. Careful consideration of each step in the work flow is needed to minimize sequence artifacts. In addition, validation of actionable mutations either by appropriate experimental design or by orthogonal methods should be considered. © 2014 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays continue to redefine the field of genetic testing. Owing to the complexity of the data, bioinformatics has become a necessary component in any laboratory implementing a clinical NGS test.; CONTENT: The computational components of an NGS-based work flow can be conceptualized as primary, secondary, and tertiary analytics. Each of these components addresses a necessary step in the transformation of raw data into clinically actionable knowledge. Understanding the basic concepts of these analysis steps is important in assessing and addressing the informatics needs of a molecular diagnostics laboratory. Equally critical is a familiarity with the regulatory requirements addressing the bioinformatics analyses. These and other topics are covered in this review article.; SUMMARY: Bioinformatics has become an important component in clinical laboratories generating, analyzing, maintaining, and interpreting data from molecular genetics testing. Given the rapid adoption of NGS-based clinical testing, service providers must develop informatics work flows that adhere to the rigor of clinical laboratory standards, yet are flexible to changes as the chemistry and software for analyzing sequencing data mature. © 2014 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB BACKGROUND: Reporting clinically actionable incidental genetic findings in the course of clinical exome testing is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). However, the performance of clinical exome methods for reporting small subsets of genes has not been previously reported.; METHODS: In this study, 57 exome data sets performed as clinical (n = 12) or research (n = 45) tests were retrospectively analyzed. Exome sequencing data was examined for adequacy in the detection of potentially pathogenic variant locations in the 56 genes described in the ACMG incidental findings recommendation. All exons of the 56 genes were examined for adequacy of sequencing coverage. In addition, nucleotide positions annotated in HGMD (Human Gene Mutation Database) were examined.; RESULTS: The 56 ACMG genes have 18 336 nucleotide variants annotated in HGMD. None of the 57 exome data sets possessed a HGMD variant. The clinical exome test had inadequate coverage for >50% of HGMD variant locations in 7 genes. Six exons from 6 different genes had consistent failure across all 3 test methods; these exons had high GC content (76%-84%).; CONCLUSIONS: The use of clinical exome sequencing for the interpretation and reporting of subsets of genes requires recognition of the substantial possibility of inadequate depth and breadth of sequencing coverage at clinically relevant locations. Inadequate depth of coverage may contribute to false-negative clinical exome results. © 2014 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB Determination of tumor genetic architecture based on tissue analysis yields important information on signaling pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis and plays a growing role in choosing the optimal medical management of malignancies. Specifically, the advent of next-generation sequencing has led to a rapidly evolving era of relatively inexpensive, high-throughput DNA sequencing of tumors. One such example is multiplexed tumor genotyping (ie, panel testing) of more than 2800 mutations across 50 commonly mutated cancer-associated genes. This resulting mutational landscape shows medically actionable pathogenic alterations to optimize antitumor therapy. We recently assessed the performance and outcome of targeted next-generation sequencing with archived endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspirates across a broad range of primary and metastatic sites with encouraging accuracy. As a result, endoscopic ultrasound has the potential to move from a test for diagnosis or confirmation of malignancy, to one in which it could facilitate the personalization of cancer-directed therapy.

AB Herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV initially manifests as chicken pox, most commonly in childhood, can remain asymptomatically latent in nerve tissues for many years and often re-emerges as shingles. Although reactivation may be related to immune suppression, aging and female sex, most inter-individual variability in re-emergence risk has not been explained to date. We performed a genome-wide association analyses in 22,981 participants (2280 shingles cases) from the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Using Cox survival and logistic regression, we identified a genomic region in the combined and European ancestry groups that has an age of onset effect reaching genome-wide significance (P>1.0 * 10(-8)). This region tags the non-coding gene HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) in the major histocompatibility complex. This gene is an endogenous retrovirus and likely influences viral activity through regulatory functions. Variants in this genetic region are known to be associated with delay in development of AIDS in people infected by HIV. Our study provides further suggestion that this region may have a critical role in viral suppression and could potentially harbor a clinically actionable variant for the shingles vaccine.

AB Cancer therapeutics is evolving to precision medicine, with the goal of matching targeted compounds with molecular aberrations underlying a patient's cancer. While murine models offer a pre-clinical tool, associated costs and time are not compatible with actionable patient-directed interventions. Using the paradigm of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a high-risk disease with defined molecular underpinnings, we developed a zebrafish human cancer xenotransplantation model to inform therapeutic decisions. Using a focused chemical genomic approach, we demonstrate that xenografted cell lines harboring mutations in the NOTCH1 and PI3K/AKT pathways respond concordantly to their targeted therapies, patient-derived T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be successfully engrafted in zebrafish and specific drug responses can be quantitatively determined. Using this approach, we identified a mutation sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibition in a xenograft from a child with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, confirmed by Sanger sequencing and validated as a gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutation. The zebrafish xenotransplantation platform provides a novel cost-effective means of tailoring leukemia therapy in real time.  Copyright© Ferrata Storti Foundation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop expeditiously a pragmatic, modular, and extensible software framework for understanding and improving healthcare value (costs relative to outcomes).; MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2012, a multidisciplinary team was assembled by the leadership of the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and charged with rapidly developing a pragmatic and actionable analytics framework for understanding and enhancing healthcare value. Based on an analysis of relevant prior work, a value analytics framework known as Value Driven Outcomes (VDO) was developed using an agile methodology. Evaluation consisted of measurement against project objectives, including implementation timeliness, system performance, completeness, accuracy, extensibility, adoption, satisfaction, and the ability to support value improvement.; RESULTS: A modular, extensible framework was developed to allocate clinical care costs to individual patient encounters. For example, labor costs in a hospital unit are allocated to patients based on the hours they spent in the unit; actual medication acquisition costs are allocated to patients based on utilization; and radiology costs are allocated based on the minutes required for study performance. Relevant process and outcome measures are also available. A visualization layer facilitates the identification of value improvement opportunities, such as high-volume, high-cost case types with high variability in costs across providers. Initial implementation was completed within 6 months, and all project objectives were fulfilled. The framework has been improved iteratively and is now a foundational tool for delivering high-value care.; CONCLUSIONS: The framework described can be expeditiously implemented to provide a pragmatic, modular, and extensible approach to understanding and improving healthcare value. © The Author 2014.

AB This article examines the judicial approach to emotional harm claims from a medical perspective. Legal rules in this area are already recognised as being illogical and incoherent. Psychological and psychiatric research illustrate that they also conflict with empirical findings. By basing claims on erroneous criteria, courts may deny liability in meritorious cases, and impose liability in possibly less deserving claims. This not only brings the law into disrepute, but also reinforces the stigma that surrounds mental illness, and does disservice to an already misunderstood and vulnerable section of people in society. The article examines the evidence for the threshold requirement that distress must qualify for a psychiatric diagnosis to be actionable, and for the Alcock secondary victim criteria. It contends that these legal rules are based in misconceptions about mental illness and trauma, and suggests an alternative approach that is more principled, yet also addresses policy concerns about excessive liability.  © The Author [2014].

AB Copy-number alterations (CNA) are among the most common molecular events in human prostate cancer genomes and are associated with worse prognosis. Identification of the oncogenic drivers within these CNAs is challenging due to the broad nature of these genomic gains or losses which can include large numbers of genes within a given region. Here, we profiled the genomes of four genetically engineered mouse prostate cancer models that reflect oncogenic events common in human prostate tumors, with the goal of integrating these data with human prostate cancer datasets to identify shared molecular events. Met was amplified in 67% of prostate tumors from Pten p53 prostate conditional null mice and in approximately 30% of metastatic human prostate cancer specimens, often in association with loss of PTEN and TP53. In murine tumors with Met amplification, Met copy-number gain and expression was present in some cells but not others, revealing intratumoral heterogeneity. Forced MET overexpression in non-MET-amplified prostate tumor cells activated PI3K and MAPK signaling and promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth, whereas MET kinase inhibition selectively impaired the growth of tumors with Met amplification. However, the impact of MET inhibitor therapy was compromised by the persistent growth of non-Met-amplified cells within Met-amplified tumors. These findings establish the importance of MET in prostate cancer progression but reveal potential limitations in the clinical use of MET inhibitors in late-stage prostate cancer. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Obesity has been on the rise in the United States over the past three decades, and is high. In addition to population-wide trends, it is clear that obesity affects some groups more than others and can be associated with age, income, education, gender, race and ethnicity, and geographic region. To reverse the obesity epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) promotes evidence-based and practice-informed strategies to address nutrition and physical activity environments and behaviors. These public health strategies require translation into actionable approaches that can be implemented by state and local entities to address disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used findings from an expert panel meeting to guide the development and dissemination of the Health Equity Resource Toolkit for State Practitioners Addressing Obesity Disparities (available at http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/health_equity/toolkit.html). The Toolkit helps public health practitioners take a systematic approach to program planning using a health equity lens. The Toolkit provides a six-step process for planning, implementing, and evaluating strategies to address obesity disparities. Each section contains (a) a basic description of the steps of the process and suggested evidence-informed actions to help address obesity disparities, (b) practical tools for carrying out activities to help reduce obesity disparities, and (c) a "real-world" case study of a successful state-level effort to address obesity with a focus on health equity that is particularly relevant to the content in that section.

AB BACKGROUND: Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus provides recommendations for surveillance monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), but limited data are available for the pediatric and congenital heart disease population.; OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of actionable events during CIED surveillance in this population, assess the utility of routine CIED remote monitoring, and assess the potential benefit from more frequent monitoring.; METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all CIED patients followed at a pediatric and congenital heart center and enrolled in the Medtronic Carelink system with either (1) a chronic (implanted for >6 months) CIED followed between July 1, 2010, and July 1, 2012, on a bimonthly schedule; or (2) a new CIED (implanted <6 months) between July 1, 2008, and July 1, 2012, followed on a monthly schedule.; RESULTS: Aggregate mean age was 20 ± 13.7 years. There were 608 interrogations on newly implanted CIEDs with an actionable event rate of 11 per 100 patient-years. There were 2614 interrogations of chronic CIEDs with an actionable event rate of 22 per 100 patient-years. The odds of an actionable event on an asymptomatic remote monitoring transmission was lower than if symptomatic (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.07). Tachyarrhythmia was the most common event. Predictors of actionable events were identified.; CONCLUSION: In this population of pediatric and congenital heart disease patients, the rate of actionable events was low, especially on asymptomatic interrogations. Most actionable events were due to tachyarrhythmia. A more frequent than every 90-day monitoring schedule does not appear to be of significant benefit. Copyright © 2015 Heart Rhythm Society.

AB In routine cancer molecular pathology, various independent experiments are required to determine mutation and amplification status of clinically relevant genes. Most of these tests are designed to identify a limited number of genetic aberrations, most likely in a given tumor type. We present a modified version of a multiplexed PCR and IonTorrent-based sequencing approach that can replace a large number of existing assays. The test allows for the simultaneous detection of point mutations and gene amplifications in 40 genes, including known hotspot regions in oncogenes (KRAS, BRAF), inactivating mutations in tumor suppressors (TP53, PTEN), and oncogene amplifications (ERBB2, EGFR). All point mutations were confirmed using certified diagnostic assays, and a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 0.875-1.0) and 99% (95% CI, 0.960-0.999), respectively, were determined for amplifications in FFPE material. Implementation of a single assay to effectively detect mutations and amplifications in clinically relevant genes not only improves the efficiency of the workflow within diagnostic laboratories but also increases the chance of detecting (rare) actionable variants for a given tumor type that are typically missed in routine pathology. The ability to obtain comprehensive and rapid mutational overviews is key for improving the efficiency of cancer patient care through tailoring treatments based on the genetic characteristics of individual tumors.

AB The great majority of targeted anticancer drugs inhibit mutated oncogenes that display increased activity. Yet many tumors do not contain such actionable aberrations, such as those harboring loss-of-function mutations. The notion of targeting synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in cancer cells has provided an alternative approach to exploiting more of the genetic and epigenetic changes acquired during tumorigenesis. Here, we review synthetic lethality as a therapeutic concept that exploits the inherent differences between normal cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the screening approaches that can be used to identify synthetic lethal interactions in human cells and present several recently identified interactions that may be pharmacologically exploited. Finally, we indicate some of the challenges of translating synthetic lethal interactions into the clinic and how these may be overcome.

AB Detection of clinically actionable mutations in diagnostic tumour specimens aids in the selection of targeted therapeutics. With an ever increasing number of clinically significant mutations identified, tumour genetic diagnostics is moving from single to multigene analysis. As it is still not feasible for routine diagnostic laboratories to perform sequencing of the entire cancer genome, our approach was to undertake targeted mutation detection. To optimise our diagnostic workflow, we evaluated three target enrichment strategies using two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms (Illumina MiSeq and Ion PGM). The target enrichment strategies were Fluidigm Access Array custom amplicon panel including 13 genes (MiSeq sequencing), the Oxford Gene Technologies (OGT) SureSeq Solid Tumour hybridisation panel including 60 genes (MiSeq sequencing), and an Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel including 50 genes (Ion PGM sequencing). DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of eight previously characterised cancer cell lines was tested using the three panels. Matching genomic DNA from fresh cultures of these cell lines was also tested using the custom Fluidigm panel and the OGT SureSeq Solid Tumour panel. Each panel allowed mutation detection of core cancer genes including KRAS, BRAF, and EGFR. Our results indicate that the panels enable accurate variant detection despite sequencing from FFPE DNA.

AB This multicenter cohort study assessed the impact of molecular profiling (MP) on advanced pancreaticobiliary cancer (PBC). The study included 30 patients treated with MP-guided therapy after failing ≥ 1 therapy for advanced PBC. Treatment was considered as having benefit for the patient if the ratio between the longest progression-free survival (PFS) on MP-guided therapy and the PFS on the last therapy before MP was ≥ 1.3. The null hypothesis was that ≤ 15% of patients gain such benefit. Overall, ≥ 1 actionable (i.e., predictive of response to specific therapies) biomarker was identified/patient. Immunohistochemistry (the most commonly used method for guiding treatment decisions) identified 1-6 (median: 4) actionable biomarkers per patient. After MP, patients received 1-4 (median: 1) regimens/patient (most commonly, FOLFIRI/XELIRI). In a decision-impact analysis, of the 27 patients for whom treatment decisions before MP were available, 74.1% experienced a treatment decision change in the first line after MP. Twenty-four patients were evaluable for clinical outcome analysis; in 37.5%, the PFS ratio was ≥ 1.3. In one-sided exact binomial test versus the null hypothesis, P = 0.0015; therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrated the feasibility, clinical decision impact, and potential clinical benefits of MP-guided therapy in advanced PBC.

AB Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm characterized by the presence of giant cells with osteoclast activity. Its biology involves the overexpression of the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kB Ligand (RANKL) by osteoclast-like giant cells and tumor stromal cells, which has been shown to be an actionable target in this disease. In cases amenable to surgical resection, very few therapeutic options were available until the recent demonstration of significant activity of the anti-RANK-ligand monoclonal antibody denosumab. Here we present a case of a patient with advanced GCT arising in the spine, recurring after multiple resections and embolization. Following initiation of denosumab, which resulted in unequivocal clinical improvement, computed tomography of the chest done for reassessment purposes revealed an intratumoral pseudoaneurysm by erosion of the aorta, further corrected by endovascular approach and stent placement. Patient had an unremarkable recovery from the procedure and continued benefit from therapy with denosumab and remains on treatment 24 months after the first dose.

AB This paper describes a case study for collecting digital footprint data for the purpose of health data mining. The case study involved 20 subjects residing in Finland who were instructed to collect data from registries which they evaluated to be useful for understanding their health or health behaviour, current or past. 11 subjects were active, sending 100 data requests to 49 distinct organizations in total. Our results indicate that there are still practical challenges in collecting actionable digital footprint data. Our subjects received a total of 75 replies (reply rate of 75.0%) and 61 datasets (reception rate of 61%). Out of the received data, 44 datasets (72.1%) were delivered in paper format, 4 (6.6%) in portable document format and 13 (21.3%) in structured digital form. The time duration between the sending of the information requests and reception of a reply was 26.4 days on the average.

AB This paper summarizes the current controversies surrounding the identification and disclosure of "incidental" or "secondary" findings from genomic sequencing and the implications for genetic counseling practice. The rapid expansion of clinical sequencing has influenced the ascertainment and return of incidental findings, while empiric data to inform best practices are still being generated. Using the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next Generation Exome Sequencing (NCGENES) research project as an example, we discuss the implications of different models of consent and their impact on patient decisions.

AB PURPOSE: In this case study we describe key features of the structured communication tool-a style guide-used to support interdisciplinary collaboration, and we propose the use of such a tool for research teams engaged in similar projects. We employ tailored infographics to present patient reported outcome data from a community health survey back, in a comprehensible and actionable manner, to the individuals who provided it. The style guide was developed to bridge the semantic gap between the domain and programming experts engaged in this effort.; INNOVATION: The style guide supports the communication of complex design specifications in a highly structured format that is nevertheless flexible enough to accommodate project growth. Unlike the typical corporate style guide that has a more narrative format, our style guide is innovative in its use of consistent fields across multiple, standalone entries.; CREDIBILITY: The process of populating the style guide prompted the designer toward greater design efficiency and led to consistent and specific instructions that met the framework architect's stated information needs.; DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The guiding values in the creation of the style guide were consistency, clarity, and flexibility. It serves as a durable reference to the desired look and functionality of the final infographic product without dictating an implementation strategy. The style guide format can be adapted to meet the communication needs of other interdisciplinary teams facing a semantic gap.

AB Holistic medicine is an interdisciplinary field of study that integrates all types of biological information (protein, small molecules, tissues, organs, external environmental signals, etc.) to lead to predictive and actionable models for health care and disease treatment. Despite the global and integrative character of this discipline, a comprehensive picture of holistic medicine for the treatment of complex diseases is still lacking. In this study, we develop a novel systems pharmacology approach to dissect holistic medicine in treating cardiocerebrovascular diseases (CCDs) by TCM (traditional Chinese medicine). Firstly, by applying the TCM active ingredients screened out by a systems-ADME process, we explored and experimentalized the signed drug-target interactions for revealing the pharmacological actions of drugs at a molecule level. Then, at a/an tissue/organ level, the drug therapeutic mechanisms were further investigated by a target-organ location method. Finally, a translational integrating pathway approach was applied to extract the diseases-therapeutic modules for understanding the complex disease and its therapy at systems level. For the first time, the feature of the drug-target-pathway-organ-cooperations for treatment of multiple organ diseases in holistic medicine was revealed, facilitating the development of novel treatment paradigm for complex diseases in the future.

AB BACKGROUND: It is not understood whether long-term good health is promoted by the absence of disease risk variants, the presence of protective variants, or both. We characterized the exomes of two exceptionally healthy centenarian brothers aged 106 and 109 years who had never been diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, or major pulmonary disease.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gain insight into whether exceptional health and longevity are a result of carrying fewer disease-associated variants than typical individuals.; METHODS: We compared the number of disease-associated alleles, and the proportion of alleles predicted to be functionally damaging, between the centenarian brothers and published population data. Mitochondrial sequence reads were extracted from the exome data in order to analyze mitochondrial variants.; RESULTS: The brothers carry a similar number of common disease-associated variants and predicted damaging variants compared to reference groups. They did not carry any high-penetrance clinically actionable variants. They carry mitochondrial haplogroup T, and one brother has a single heteroplasmic variant.; CONCLUSION: Although our small sample size does not allow for definitive conclusions, a healthy aging and longevity phenotype is not necessarily due to a decreased burden of common disease-associated variants. Instead, it may be rare 'positive' variants that play a role in this desirable phenotype. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective: To describe how practice leaders used Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Clinician and Group (CG-CAHPS) data in transitioning toward a patient-centered medical home (PCMH).; Study design: Interviews conducted at 14 primary care practices within a large urban Federally Qualified Health Center in California.; Participants: Thirty-eight interviews were conducted with lead physicians (n=13), site clinic administrators (n=13), nurse supervisors (n=10), and executive leadership (n=2).; Results: Seven themes were identified on how practice leaders used CG-CAHPS data for PCMH transformation. CAHPS was used: 1) for quality improvement (QI) and focusing changes for PCMH transformation; 2) to maintain focus on patient experience; 3) alongside other data; 4) for monitoring site-level trends and changes; 5) to identify, analyze, and monitor areas for improvement; 6) for provider-level performance monitoring and individual coaching within a transparent environment of accountability; and 7) for PCMH transformation, but changes to instrument length, reading level, and the wording of specific items were suggested.; Conclusion: Practice leaders used CG-CAHPS data to implement QI, develop a shared vision, and coach providers and staff on performance. They described how CAHPS helped to improve the patient experience in the PCMH model, including access to routine and urgent care, wait times, provider spending enough time and listening carefully, and courteousness of staff. Regular reporting, reviewing, and discussing of patient-experience data alongside other clinical quality and productivity measures at multilevels of the organization was critical in maximizing the use of CAHPS data as PCMH changes were made. In sum, this study found that a system-wide accountability and data-monitoring structure relying on a standardized and actionable patient-experience survey, such as CG-CAHPS, is key to supporting the continuous QI needed for moving beyond formal PCMH recognition to maximizing primary care medical home transformation.

AB BACKGROUND: Current histologic methods for diagnosis are limited by intra- and inter-observer variability. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods are frequently used to assess biomarkers to aid diagnoses, however, IHC staining is variable and nonlinear and the manual interpretation is subjective. Furthermore, the biomarkers assessed clinically are typically biomarkers of epithelial cell processes. Tumors and premalignant tissues are not composed only of epithelial cells but are interacting systems of multiple cell types, including various stromal cell types that are involved in cancer development. The complex network of the tissue system highlights the need for a systems biology approach to anatomic pathology, in which quantification of system processes is combined with informatics tools to produce actionable scores to aid clinical decision-making.; AIMS: Here, we describe a quantitative, multiplexed biomarker imaging approach termed TissueCypher that applies systems biology to anatomic pathology. Applications of TissueCypher in understanding the tissue system of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and the potential use as an adjunctive tool in the diagnosis of BE are described.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: The TissueCypher Image Analysis Platform was used to assess 14 epithelial and stromal biomarkers with known diagnostic significance in BE in a set of BE biopsies with nondysplastic BE with reactive atypia (RA, n = 22) and Barrett's with high-grade dysplasia (HGD, n = 17). Biomarker and morphology features were extracted and evaluated in the confirmed BE HGD cases versus the nondysplastic BE cases with RA.; RESULTS: Multiple image analysis features derived from epithelial and stromal biomarkers, including immune biomarkers and morphology, showed significant differences between HGD and RA.; CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of epithelial cell abnormalities combined with an assessment of cellular changes in the lamina propria may serve as an adjunct to conventional pathology in the assessment of BE.

AB Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, both within the US and worldwide. There have been major treatment advances in NSCLC over the past decade with the discovery of molecular drivers of NSCLC, which has ushered in an era of personalized medicine. There are several actionable genetic aberrations in NSCLC, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In 3%-7% of NSCLC, a chromosomal inversion event in chromosome 2 leads to fusion of a portion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene. The constitutive activation of the ALK fusion oncogene renders it vulnerable to therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on the first-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC using ALK inhibitors. Crizotinib was the first agent proven to be efficacious as first-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC. However, acquired resistance inevitably develops. The central nervous system is a sanctuary site that represents a common site for disease progression as well. Hence, more potent, selective next-generation ALK inhibitors that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier have been developed for treatment against crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC and are also currently being evaluated for first-line therapy as well. In this review, we provide summary of the clinical experience with these drugs in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC.

AB Adaptive multiscale prognostics and health management (AM-PHM) is a methodology designed to support PHM in smart manufacturing systems. As a rule, PHM information is not used in high-level decision-making in manufacturing systems. AM-PHM leverages and integrates component-level PHM information with hierarchical relationships across the component, machine, work cell, and production line levels in a manufacturing system. The AM-PHM methodology enables the creation of actionable prognostic and diagnostic intelligence up and down the manufacturing process hierarchy. Decisions are made with the knowledge of the current and projected health state of the system at decision points along the nodes of the hierarchical structure. A description of the AM-PHM methodology with a simulated canonical robotic assembly process is presented.

AB Social media are quickly becoming the channel of choice for disseminating emergency warning messages. However, relatively little data-driven research exists to inform effective message design when using these media. The present study addresses that void by examining terse health-related warning messages sent by public safety agencies over Twitter during the 2013 Boulder, CO, floods. An examination of 5,100 tweets from 52 Twitter accounts over the course of the 5-day flood period yielded several key conclusions and implications. First, public health messages posted by local emergency management leaders are most frequently retweeted by organizations in our study. Second, emergency public health messages focus primarily on drinking water in this event. Third, terse messages can be designed in ways that include imperative/instructional and declarative/explanatory styles of content, both of which are essential for promoting public health during crises. These findings demonstrate that even terse messages delivered via Twitter ought to provide information about the hazard event, its impact, and actionable instructions for self-protection.

AB INTRODUCTION: Widespread practices supporting availability of healthful foods, beverages, and physical activity in out-of-school-time (OST) settings would further obesity prevention efforts. The objective of this article was to describe principles to guide policy development in support of healthy eating and physical activity practices in out-of-school settings to promote obesity prevention.; METHODS: The Institute of Medicine's L.E.A.D. framework (Locate Evidence, Evaluate it, Assemble it, and Inform Decisions) was used to identify practices relevant to children's healthful eating in most OST settings: 1) locate and evaluate information from a national survey of children's perceptions of healthful-food access; published research, reports, policies and guidelines; and roundtables with OST organizations' administrators; 2) assemble information to prioritize actionable practices; and 3) inform programmatic direction.; RESULTS: Three evidence-informed guiding principles for short-duration OST resulted: 1) drink right: choose water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages; 2) move more: boost movement and physical activity in all programs; and 3) snack smart: fuel up on fruits and vegetables.; CONCLUSION: Healthy Kids Out of School was launched to support the dissemination and implementation of these guiding principles in short-duration OST settings, complementing efforts in other OST settings to shift norms around eating and physical activity.

AB BACKGROUND: This article outlines procedures for the feedback of individual research data to participants. This feedback framework was developed in the context of a personalized medicine research project in Canada. Researchers in this domain have an ethical obligation to return individual research results and/or material incidental findings that are clinically significant, valid and actionable to participants. Communication of individual research data must proceed in an ethical and efficient manner. Feedback involves three procedural steps: assessing the health relevance of a finding, re-identifying the affected participant, and communicating the finding. Re-identification requires researchers to break the code in place to protect participant identities. Coding systems replace personal identifiers with a numerical code. Double coding systems provide added privacy protection by separating research data from personal identifying data with a third "linkage" database. A trusted and independent intermediary, the "keyholder", controls access to this linkage database.; DISCUSSION: Procedural guidelines for the return of individual research results and incidental findings are lacking. This article outlines a procedural framework for the three steps of feedback: assessment, re-identification, and communication. This framework clarifies the roles of the researcher, Research Ethics Board, and keyholder in the process. The framework also addresses challenges posed by coding systems. Breaking the code involves privacy risks and should only be carried out in clearly defined circumstances. Where a double coding system is used, the keyholder plays an important role in balancing the benefits of individual feedback with the privacy risks of re-identification. Feedback policies should explicitly outline procedures for the assessment of findings, and the re-identification and contact of participants. The responsibilities of researchers, the Research Ethics Board, and the keyholder must be clearly defined. We provide general guidelines for keyholders involved in feedback. We also recommend that Research Ethics Boards should not be directly involved in the assessment of individual findings. Hospitals should instead establish formal, interdisciplinary clinical advisory committees to help researchers determine whether or not an uncertain finding should be returned.

AB The androgen receptor (AR) is a key driver of prostate cancer (PC), even in the state of castration-resistant PC (CRPC) and frequently even after treatment with second-line hormonal therapies such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. The persistence of AR activity via both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms (including constitutively active AR splice variants) highlights the unmet need for alternative approaches to block AR signaling in CRPC. We investigated the transcription factor GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) as a regulator of AR signaling and an actionable therapeutic target in PC. We demonstrate that GATA2 directly promotes expression of both full-length and splice-variant AR, resulting in a strong positive correlation between GATA2 and AR expression in both PC cell lines and patient specimens. Conversely, GATA2 expression is repressed by androgen and AR, suggesting a negative feedback regulatory loop that, upon androgen deprivation, derepresses GATA2 to contribute to AR overexpression in CRPC. Simultaneously, GATA2 is necessary for optimal transcriptional activity of both full-length and splice-variant AR. GATA2 colocalizes with AR and Forkhead box protein A1 on chromatin to enhance recruitment of steroid receptor coactivators and formation of the transcriptional holocomplex. In agreement with these important functions, high GATA2 expression and transcriptional activity predicted worse clinical outcome in PC patients. A GATA2 small molecule inhibitor suppressed the expression and transcriptional function of both full-length and splice-variant AR and exerted potent anticancer activity against PC cell lines. We propose pharmacological inhibition of GATA2 as a first-in-field approach to target AR expression and function and improve outcomes in CRPC.

AB Chromosomal rearrangements have a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and often result in the expression of therapeutically actionable gene fusions. A recently discovered example is a fusion between the genes echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), generated by an inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2: inv(2)(p21p23). The EML4-ALK oncogene is detected in a subset of human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is clinically relevant because it confers sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. Despite their importance, modelling such genetic events in mice has proven challenging and requires complex manipulation of the germ line. Here we describe an efficient method to induce specific chromosomal rearrangements in vivo using viral-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to somatic cells of adult animals. We apply it to generate a mouse model of Eml4-Alk-driven lung cancer. The resulting tumours invariably harbour the Eml4-Alk inversion, express the Eml4-Alk fusion gene, display histopathological and molecular features typical of ALK(+) human NSCLCs, and respond to treatment with ALK inhibitors. The general strategy described here substantially expands our ability to model human cancers in mice and potentially in other organisms.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancer (BC) cases and contributes disproportionately to BC mortality. TAZ, a key transducer of the Hippo pathway, has recently been demonstrated to confer breast cancer stem cell (CSC) traits. However, TAZ target genes and the underlying transcriptional regulatory pathways responsible for the CSC phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the oncogenic activity of TAZ is essential for propagation of the malignant phenotype. We further show that constitutively active TAZ tumor-derived cells exhibit unique tumor-initiating properties, including increased self-renewal and metastatic seeding potential, acquired chemotherapy resistance and the ability to efficiently regenerate tumor formation in vivo. Combined digital RNA expression analysis and computational network approaches identify several signaling pathways that distinguish breast cancer tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) from bulk tumor cells. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by repositioning the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib, which selectively targets T-ICs and inhibits TNBC growth in vivo.

AB MOTIVATION: Because of its low cost, amplicon sequencing, also known as ultra-deep targeted sequencing, is now becoming widely used in oncology for detection of actionable mutations, i.e. mutations influencing cell sensitivity to targeted therapies. Amplicon sequencing is based on the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the regions of interest, a process that considerably distorts the information on copy numbers initially present in the tumor DNA. Therefore, additional experiments such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays often complement amplicon sequencing in clinics to identify copy number status of genes whose amplification or deletion has direct consequences on the efficacy of a particular cancer treatment. So far, there has been no proven method to extract the information on gene copy number aberrations based solely on amplicon sequencing.; RESULTS: Here we present ONCOCNV, a method that includes a multifactor normalization and annotation technique enabling the detection of large copy number changes from amplicon sequencing data. We validated our approach on high and low amplicon density datasets and demonstrated that ONCOCNV can achieve a precision comparable with that of array CGH techniques in detecting copy number aberrations. Thus, ONCOCNV applied on amplicon sequencing data would make the use of additional array CGH or SNP array experiments unnecessary. © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB We present a model of visualization design based on algebraic considerations of the visualization process. The model helps characterize visual encodings, guide their design, evaluate their effectiveness, and highlight their shortcomings. The model has three components: the underlying mathematical structure of the data or object being visualized, the concrete representation of the data in a computer, and (to the extent possible) a mathematical description of how humans perceive the visualization. Because we believe the value of our model lies in its practical application, we propose three general principles for good visualization design. We work through a collection of examples where our model helps explain the known properties of existing visualizations methods, both good and not-so-good, as well as suggesting some novel methods. We describe how to use the model alongside experimental user studies, since it can help frame experiment outcomes in an actionable manner. Exploring the implications and applications of our model and its design principles should provide many directions for future visualization research.

AB Designing molecular targeted therapy with high specificity based on novel tumor biomarkers is a high priority in lung cancer research. Several molecular aberrations have been already identified in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with subsequent development of drugs targeted to these aberrations. A more recent actionable target is MET, a multifaceted receptor tyrosine kinase which frequently interacts with other key oncogenic tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERBB3 leading to resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. However a phase III trial enrolling only patients with MET-positive tumors was stopped in early March due to futility since there was no evidence that the addition of onartuzumab to erlotinib has any positive effect. From the results of the MET lung phase III trial, we provide new pieces of information that can contribute to further preclinical validation and also be part of the armamentarium for clinical translational research.

AB This article discusses an anomaly in the English law of reproductive liability: that is, an inconsistency between the law's approach to wrongful life claims and its approach to cases of negligent selection of gametes or embryos in infertility treatments (the selection cases). The article begins with an account of the legal position, which brings into view the relevant inconsistency: while the law treats wrongful life claims as non-actionable, it recognises a cause of action in the selection cases, although the selection cases bear a relevant resemblance to wrongful life claims. The article then considers arguments that may be invoked in an attempt to reconcile the above two strands of the law. Three of these counterarguments consist in attempts to distinguish the selection cases from wrongful life claims. It is argued that these attempts fail to reveal a valid basis for treating these situations differently. A fourth possible counterargument levels against the present analysis a charge of reductio ad absurdum. It is shown that this argument suffers from a fundamental flaw caused by confusion between different senses of the term "identity". Finally, the article discusses possible changes to the legal position that could rectify the problem. It argues that one of these changes, which focuses on legal redress for violation of personal autonomy, is particularly apt to resolve the problem at hand, but also highlights the need for further inquiry into the broader implications of introducing this form of redress into the law of torts.

AB BACKGROUND: Although research participation is essential for clinical investigation, few quantitative outcome measures exist to assess participants' experiences. To address this, we developed and deployed a survey at 15 NIH-supported clinical research centers to assess participant-centered outcomes; we report responses from 4,961 participants.; METHODS: Survey questions addressed core aspects of the research participants' experience, including their overall rating, motivation, trust, and informed consent. We describe participant characteristics, responses to individual questions, and correlations among responses.; RESULTS: Respondents broadly represented the research population in sex, race, and ethnicity. Seventy-three percent awarded top ratings to their overall research experience and 94% reported no pressure to enroll. Top ratings correlated with feeling treated with respect, listened to, and having access to the research team (R(2) = 0.80-0.96). White participants trusted researchers more (88%) than did nonwhite participants collectively (80%; p < 0.0001). Many participants felt fully prepared by the informed consent process (67%) and wanted to receive research results (72%).; CONCLUSIONS: Our survey demonstrates that a majority of participants at NIH-supported clinical research centers rate their research experience very positively and that participant-centered outcome measures identify actionable items for improvement of participant's experiences, research protections, and the conduct of clinical investigation. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Building upon extensive research from 2 validated well-being instruments, the objective of this research was to develop and validate a comprehensive and actionable well-being instrument that informs and facilitates improvement of well-being for individuals, communities, and nations. The goals of the measure were comprehensiveness, validity and reliability, significant relationships with health and performance outcomes, and diagnostic capability for intervention. For measure development and validation, questions from the Well-being Assessment and Wellbeing Finder were simultaneously administered as a test item pool to over 13,000 individuals across 3 independent samples. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on a random selection from the first sample and confirmed in the other samples. Further evidence of validity was established through correlations to the established well-being scores from the Well-Being Assessment and Wellbeing Finder, and individual outcomes capturing health care utilization and productivity. Results showed the Well-Being 5 score comprehensively captures the known constructs within well-being, demonstrates good reliability and validity, significantly relates to health and performance outcomes, is diagnostic and informative for intervention, and can track and compare well-being over time and across groups. With this tool, well-being deficiencies within a population can be effectively identified, prioritized, and addressed, yielding the potential for substantial improvements to the health status, performance, and quality of life for individuals and cost savings for stakeholders.

AB Worldwide, the group of older persons is growing fast. To aid this important group in their food and meal requirements, a deeper insight into the expectations and experiences of these persons regarding their mealtimes and snack times is needed. In the current study, we aim to identify consumer segments within the group of vital community-dwelling older persons on the basis of the emotions they associate with their mealtimes and snack times (from now on referred to as mealtimes). Participants (n=392, mean age 65.8 (years)±5.9 (SD)) completed an online survey. The survey consisted of three questionnaires: emotions associated with mealtimes, functionality of mealtimes, and psychographic characteristics (health and taste attitudes, food fussiness, and food neophobia). Consumer segments were identified and characterised based on the emotions that the respondents reported to experience at mealtimes, using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Clusters were described using variables previously not included in the cluster analysis, such as functionality of mealtimes and psychographic characteristics. Four consumer segments were identified: Pleasurable averages, Adventurous arousals, Convivial indulgers, and Indifferent restrictives. These segments differed significantly in their emotional associations with mealtimes both in valence and level of arousal. The present study provides actionable insights for the development of products and communication strategies tailored to the needs of vital community-dwelling older persons.

AB UNLABELLED: Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (PACC) account for approximately 1% (500 cases) of pancreatic cancer diagnoses annually in the United States. Oncogenic therapuetic targets have proven elusive in this disease, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy have demonstrated limited efficacy against these tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a large series of PACCs (n=44) identified recurrent rearrangements involving BRAF and RAF1 (CRAF) in approximately 23% of tumors. The most prevalent fusion, SND1-BRAF, resulted in activation of the MAPK pathway, which was abrogated with MEK inhibition. SND1-BRAF-transformed cells were sensitive to treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. PACCs lacking RAF rearrangements were significantly enriched for genomic alterations, causing inactivation of DNA repair genes (45%); these genomic alterations have been associated with sensitivity to platinum-based therapies and PARP inhibitors. Collectively, these results identify potentially actionable genomic alterations in the majority of PACCs and provide a rationale for using personalized therapies in this disease.; SIGNIFICANCE: PACC is genomically distinct from other pancreatic cancers. Fusions in RAF genes and mutually exclusive inactivation of DNA repair genes represent novel potential therapeutic targets that are altered in over two thirds of these tumors. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Imaging 3.0 is a blueprint for the future of radiology modeled after the description of Web 3.0 as "more connected, more open, and more intelligent." Imaging 3.0 involves radiologists' using their expertise to manage all aspects of imaging care to improve patient safety and outcomes and to deliver high-value care. IT tools are critical elements and drivers of success as radiologists embrace the concepts of Imaging 3.0. Organized radiology, specifically the ACR, is the natural convener and resource for the development of this Imaging 3.0 toolkit. The ACR's new Imaging 3.0 Informatics Committee is actively working to develop the informatics tools radiologists need to improve efficiency, deliver more value, and provide quantitative ways to demonstrate their value in new health care delivery and payment systems. This article takes each step of the process of delivering high-value Imaging 3.0 care and outlines the tools available as well as additional resources available to support practicing radiologists. From the moment when imaging is considered through the delivery of a meaningful and actionable report that is communicated to the referring clinician and, when appropriate, to the patient, Imaging 3.0 IT tools will enable radiologists to position themselves as vital constituents in cost-effective, high-value health care.

AB Maize originated in the highlands of Mexico approximately 8700 years ago and is one of the most commonly grown cereal crops worldwide, followed by wheat and rice. Abiotic stresses (primarily drought, salinity, and high and low temperatures), together with biotic stresses (primarily fungi, viruses, and pests), negatively affect maize growth, development, and eventually production. To understand the response of maize to abiotic and biotic stresses and its mechanism of stress tolerance, high-throughput omics approaches have been used in maize stress studies. Integrated omics approaches are crucial for dissecting the temporal and spatial system-level changes that occur in maize under various stresses. In this comprehensive analysis, we review the primary types of stresses that threaten sustainable maize production; underscore the recent advances in maize stress omics, especially proteomics; and discuss the opportunities, challenges, and future directions of maize stress omics, with a view to sustainable food production. The knowledge gained from studying maize stress omics is instrumental for improving maize to cope with various stresses and to meet the food demands of the exponentially growing global population. Omics systems science offers actionable potential solutions for sustainable food production, and we present maize as a notable case study.

AB OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relationships between supportive and obstructive family behaviors and patients' diabetes self-care activities and HbA1C, and potential interaction effects and differences by demographic characteristics.; METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 192 adults with type 2 diabetes completed the Diabetes Family Behavior Checklist-II, the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and a glycemic control (HbA1C) test.; RESULTS: Participants reported similar rates of supportive and obstructive behaviors that were positively correlated (rho=0.61, p<0.001). In adjusted analyses, supportive family behaviors were associated with adherence to different self-care behaviors (beta=0.20 to 0.50, p<0.05), whereas obstructive family behaviors were associated with less adherence to self-care behaviors (beta=-0.28 to -0.39, p<0.01) and worse HbA1C (beta=0.18, p<0.05). Supportive behaviors protected against the detrimental effect of obstructive behaviors on HbA1C (interaction beta=-0.22, p<0.001). Non-Whites reported more supportive and obstructive behaviors than Whites, but race did not affect the relationships between family behaviors and self-care or HbA1C.; CONCLUSION: Involving family members in patients' diabetes management may impede patients' self-care and compromise their glycemic control unless family members are taught to avoid obstructive behaviors.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our findings endorse interventions that help family members develop actionable plans to support patients' self-care and train them to communicate productively about diabetes management.

AB PURPOSE: Recent policies specifying criteria about which individual research results to return leave considerable discretion to researchers. This study investigated the types of results that the public wants when participating in genetic research and whether preferences differ based on willingness to participate.; METHODS: A representative survey of US adults used conjoint analysis to measure priorities among eight principles of a results policy for a proposed large-cohort study. Policy preferences were measured using 12 tasks in which respondents chose between two groupings of the policy principles. Stratified analysis compared those self-identified as likely or unlikely to participate in genomic research.; RESULTS: Of 1,515 respondents, 56% would participate in the proposed study. All eight principles were positively endorsed by participants (all P < 0.003), with priority placed on providing results at no cost and returning well-validated results for treatable and serious diseases. Providing detailed result reports was more highly valued than providing staff to explain results (P = 0.0005). Receiving results about major changes in risk was marginally disvalued by those unlikely to participate (P = 0.35).; CONCLUSION: Public preferences for well-validated individual research results for serious, actionable diseases agree with emerging recommendations. However, because preferences for receiving individual research results vary, some choices should be offered to research participants.

AB Lung cancer is characterized by a number of genetic alterations, of which a proportion is still unknown. Nevertheless numerous pathogenetically important driver changes have been already been detected in a substantial fraction of patients and translated into a system to improve detection and outcome of the disease. In this scenario, the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium developed an ambitious project aimed to perform on large scale the molecular profile of lung adenocarcinoma in order to identify actionable targets. The review analyses the paper - recently published showing study findings- taking into account if the car and not the driver matters in lung cancer precision management.

AB BACKGROUND: Prenatal care provider weight gain advice consistent with the Institute of Medicine recommendations is related to guideline-adherent gestational weight gain (GWG), yet many women may not receive guideline-congruent advice. We examined pregnant women's recall of prenatal care provider GWG advice in relation to prepregnancy body mass index (BMI).; METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of women (n = 149) receiving prenatal care for a singleton pregnancy at a large academic medical center in 2010. Data were collected via a survey during late pregnancy and medical record abstraction.; RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of women did not recall receiving the provider GWG advice; 33 percent recalled advice consistent with 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations. Recalled advice differed by prepregnancy BMI; 29 percent of normal weight, 26 percent of overweight, and 45 percent of obese women reported not receiving advice, and 6, 37, and 39 percent, respectively, recalled advice exceeding Institute of Medicine recommendations. Among the 62 percent who recalled that their provider had labeled their prepregnancy BMI, 100 percent of normal weight, 32 percent of overweight, and 23 percent of obese women recalled the labels "normal weight," "overweight," and "obese," respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Helping providers give their patients memorable and guideline-consistent GWG advice is an actionable step toward preventing excessive GWG and associated maternal and child health consequences. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Next-generation sequencing enables testing for multiple genes simultaneously ('panel-based testing') as opposed to sequential testing for one inherited condition at a time ('syndrome-based testing'). This study presents results from patients who underwent hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) panel-based testing ('ColoNext() '). De-identified data from a clinical testing laboratory were used to calculate (1) frequencies for patient demographic, clinical, and family history variables and (2) rates of pathogenic mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS). The proportion of individuals with a pathogenic mutation who met national syndrome-based testing criteria was also determined. Of 586 patients, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 10.4%, while 20.1% had at least one VUS. After removing eight patients with CHEK2 mutations and 11 MUTYH heterozygotes, the percentage of patients with 'actionable' mutations that would clearly alter cancer screening recommendations per national guidelines decreased to 7.2%. Of 42 patients with an 'actionable' result, 30 (71%) clearly met established syndrome-based testing guidelines. This descriptive study is among the first to report on a large clinical series of patients undergoing panel-based testing for inherited CRC. Results are discussed in the context of benefits and concerns that have been raised about panel-based testing implementation.  © 2014 The Authors.

AB The current classification system for breast cancer is based on expression of empirical prognostic and predictive biomarkers. As an alternative, we propose a hypothesis-based ontological breast cancer classification modeled after the taxonomy of species in evolutionary biology. This approach uses normal breast epithelial cell types and differentiation lineages as the gold standard to classify tumors. We show that there are at least eleven previously undefined normal cell types in human breast epithelium and that each breast carcinoma is related to one of these normal cell types. We find that triple negative breast cancers do not have a 'basal-like' phenotype. Normal breast epithelial cells conform to four novel hormonal differentiation states and almost all human breast tumors duplicate one of these hormonal differentiation states which have significant survival differences. This ontological classification scheme provides actionable treatment strategies and provides an alternative approach for understanding tumor biology with wide-ranging implications for tumor taxonomy.

AB INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The Actionable Bladder Symptom Screening Tool (ABSST) was initially developed to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who could benefit from lower urinary tract assessment and treatment. Assessment of the measurement properties of the ABSST, including its ability to identify patients experiencing bladder symptoms related to overactive bladder (OAB), was undertaken in a general female population.; METHODS: One hundred women completed the ABSST, OAB Questionnaire Short Form (OAB-q SF), and a patient global impression of severity (PGI-S) scale. Half of the sample had urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), while the other half did not. Descriptive statistics, reliability, and validity were examined, as was sensitivity and specificity of the previous cut-off score established in MS.; RESULTS: Fifty-three women with UUI/OAB and 47 controls took part (71.0 % Caucasian). Patients with UUI/OAB were older (54.6 vs 40.4 years), had a higher body mass index (31.1 vs 26.4 kg/m(2)), and more comorbid conditions. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of ABSST was 0.90. High correlations with OAB-q SF Symptom Bother and Health Related Quality of Life (r=0.83 and -0.81 respectively) supported concurrent validity. Using the PGI-S severity scores as a reference, the ABSST was able to distinguish patients with differing severity levels (known-group validity). Physician assessment of the need for further evaluation/treatment showed sensitivity (79 %) and specificity (98 %), supporting a cut-off score of ≥3.; CONCLUSIONS: The previous MS ABSST scoring algorithm was validated in a non-neurogenic female population. ABSST is a reliable, valid, and sensitive tool for screening women with UUI/OAB.

AB BACKGROUND: Recognizing that clergy and spiritual care providers are a key part of mental health care systems, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) jointly examined chaplains' current and potential roles in caring for veterans and service members with mental health needs.; OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the intersection of chaplain and mental health care practices in VA and DoD in order to determine if improvement is needed, and if so, to develop actionable recommendations as indicated by evaluation findings.; DESIGN: A 38-member multidisciplinary task group partnered with researchers in designing, implementing, and interpreting a mixed methods study that included: 1) a quantitative survey of VA and DoD chaplains; and 2) qualitative interviews with mental health providers and chaplains.; PARTICIPANTS: Quantitative: the survey included all full-time VA chaplains and all active duty military chaplains (n=2,163 completed of 3,464 invited; 62 % response rate). Qualitative: a total of 291 interviews were conducted with mental health providers and chaplains during site visits to 33 VA and DoD facilities.; MAIN MEASURES: Quantitative: the online survey assessed intersections between chaplaincy and mental health care and took an average of 37 min to complete. Qualitative: the interviews assessed current integration of mental health and chaplain services and took an average of 1 h to complete.; KEY RESULTS: When included on interdisciplinary mental health care teams, chaplains feel understood and valued (82.8-100 % of chaplains indicated this, depending on the team). However, findings from the survey and site visits suggest that integration of services is often lacking and can be improved.; CONCLUSIONS: Closely coordinating with a multidisciplinary task group in conducting a mixed method evaluation of chaplain-mental health integration in VA and DoD helped to ensure that researchers assessed relevant domains and that findings could be rapidly translated into actionable recommendations.

AB In its 1999 report, the Institute of Medicine estimated that medical error leads to between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths per year. Given that statistic, public reporting of quality and safety metrics is a welcome response that may serve to reduce the rate of adverse events and restore patients' trust in the health care system. To ensure that any public reporting system fulfills its potential, several questions must be addressed: Are we measuring the right metrics? Are the metrics accurate, valid, and is their public reporting effecting change? Based on a review of the literature, it is clear that current metrics suffer from low reliability, low validity, and possibly minimal relevance to the intended consumer. To improve data collection and analysis, both physicians and health care consumers need to be involved in the design and collection of metrics. Until we have a valid, reliable, and actionable data set at our fingertips, it would behoove patients, providers, and institutions to look at outcome and safety metrics with a skeptical and discerning eye.

AB To improve healthcare quality and reduce costs, the Affordable Care Act places hospitals at financial risk for excessive readmissions associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia (PN). Although predictive analytics is increasingly looked to as a means for measuring, comparing, and managing this risk, many modeling tools require data inputs that are not readily available and/or additional resources to yield actionable information. This article demonstrates how hospitals and clinicians can use their own structured discharge data to create decision trees that produce highly transparent, clinically relevant decision rules for better managing readmission risk associated with AMI, HF, and PN. For illustrative purposes, basic decision trees are trained and tested using publically available data from the California State Inpatient Databases and an open-source statistical package. As expected, these simple models perform less well than other more sophisticated tools, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (or AUC) of 0.612, 0.583, and 0.650, respectively, but achieve a lift of at least 1.5 or greater for higher-risk patients with any of the three conditions. More importantly, they are shown to offer substantial advantages in terms of transparency and interpretability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. By enabling hospitals and clinicians to identify important factors associated with readmissions, target subgroups of patients at both high and low risk, and design and implement interventions that are appropriate to the risk levels observed, decision trees serve as an ideal application for addressing the challenge of reducing hospital readmissions.

AB OPINION STATEMENT: Lung cancer is still responsible for the highest number of cancer deaths worldwide. Despite this fact, significant progress has been made in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, efforts to identify and treat genetic alterations (gene mutations, gene fusions, gene amplification events, etc.) that result in oncogenic drivers are now standard of care (EGFR and ALK) or an intense area of research. The most prevalent oncogenic drivers have likely already been identified; thus, there is now a focus on subgroups of tumors with less common genetic alterations. Interestingly, as we explore these less common mutations, we are discovering that many occur across other tumor types (i.e., non-lung cancer), further justifying their study. Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated that by searching broadly for multiple genetic alterations in large subsets of patients they are able to identify potentially targetable alterations in the majority of patients. Although individually, the rare oncogenic drivers subgroups may seem to occur too infrequently to justify their exploration, the fact that the majority of patients with NSCLC harbor a potentially actionable driver mutation within their tumors and the fact that different types of cancers often have the same oncogenic driver justifies this approach.

AB Cancer survivors who continue to smoke following diagnosis are at increased risk for recurrence. Yet, smoking prevalence among survivors is similar to the general population. Adherence to cystoscopic surveillance is an important disease-management strategy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) survivors, but data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (SEER) suggest current adherence levels are insufficient to identify recurrences at critically early stages. This study was conducted to identify actionable targets for educational intervention to increase adherence to cystoscopic monitoring for disease recurrence or progression. NMIBC survivors (n=109) completed telephone-based surveys. Adherence was determined by measuring time from diagnosis to interview date; cystoscopies received were then compared to American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests for univariate and logistic regression for multivariable analyses. Participants averaged 65 years (SD=9.3) and were primarily white (95 %), male (75 %), married (75 %), and non-smokers (84 %). Eighty-three percent reported either Ta- or T1-stage bladder tumors. Forty-five percent met AUA guidelines for adherence. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers reported increased fear of recurrence and psychological distress (p<0.05). In regression analyses, non-adherence was associated with smoking (OR=33.91, p<0.01), providing a behavioral marker to describe a survivor group with unmet needs that may contribute to low cystoscopic adherence. Research assessing survivorship needs and designing and evaluating educational programs for NMIBC survivors should be a high priority. Identifying unmet needs among NMIBC survivors and developing programs to address these needs may increase compliance with cystoscopic monitoring, improve outcomes, and enhance quality of life.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite universal recognition of the importance of hand hygiene in reducing the incidence of healthcare associated infections, health care workers' compliance with best practice has been sub-optimal. Senior hospital managers have responsibilities for implementing patient safety initiatives and are therefore ideally placed to provide suggestions for improving strategies to increase hand hygiene compliance. This is an under-researched area, accordingly the aim of this study was to identify senior hospital managers' views on current and innovative strategies to improve hand hygiene compliance.; METHODS: Qualitative design comprising face-to-face interviews with thirteen purposively sampled senior managers at a major teaching and referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Data were analysed thematically.; RESULTS: Seven themes emerged: culture change starts with leaders, refresh and renew the message, connect the five moments to the whole patient journey, actionable audit results, empower patients, reconceptualising non-compliance and start using the hammer.; CONCLUSIONS: To strengthen hand hygiene programmes, strategies based on the five moments of hand hygiene should be tailored to specific roles and settings and take into account the whole patient journey including patient interactions with clinical and non-clinical staff. Senior clinical and non-clinical leaders should visibly champion and mandate best practice initiatives and articulate that hand hygiene non-compliance is culturally and professionally unacceptable to the organization. Strategies that included a disciplinary component and which conceptualise hand hygiene non-compliance as a patient safety error may be worth evaluating in terms of staff acceptability and effectiveness.

AB Cancer genome sequencing is being used at an increasing rate to identify actionable driver mutations that can inform therapeutic intervention strategies. A comparison of two of the most prominent cancer genome sequencing databases from different institutes (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) revealed marked discrepancies in the detection of missense mutations in identical cell lines (57.38% conformity). The main reason for this discrepancy is inadequate sequencing of GC-rich areas of the exome. We have therefore mapped over 400 regions of consistent inadequate sequencing (cold-spots) in known cancer-causing genes and kinases, in 368 of which neither institute finds mutations. We demonstrate, using a newly identified PAK4 mutation as proof of principle, that specific targeting and sequencing of these GC-rich cold-spot regions can lead to the identification of novel driver mutations in known tumor suppressors and oncogenes. We highlight that cross-referencing between genomic databases is required to comprehensively assess genomic alterations in commonly used cell lines and that there are still significant opportunities to identify novel drivers of tumorigenesis in poorly sequenced areas of the exome. Finally, we assess other reasons for the observed discrepancy, such as variations in dbSNP filtering and the acquisition/loss of mutations, to give explanations as to why there is a discrepancy in pharmacogenomic studies, given recent concerns with poor reproducibility of data. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB IMPORTANCE: Clinical whole-exome sequencing is increasingly used for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected genetic disorders.; OBJECTIVE: To perform clinical whole-exome sequencing and report (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) the spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental findings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Observational study of 2000 consecutive patients with clinical whole-exome sequencing analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. Whole-exome sequencing tests were performed at a clinical genetics laboratory in the United States. Results were reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily pediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), demonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental delay.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Whole-exome sequencing diagnosis rate overall and by phenotypic category, mode of inheritance, spectrum of genetic events, and reporting of incidental findings.; RESULTS: A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously reported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 (27.2%; 95% CI, 23.5%-31.2%) for the neurological group, 282/1147 (24.6%; 95% CI, 22.1%-27.2%) for the neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 (36.1%; 95% CI, 26.1%-47.5%) for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 (20.1%; 95% CI, 15.6%-25.8%) for the nonneurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal dominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessive (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X-linked, and 1 (0.2%) mitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene defects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations in disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 medically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for management in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Whole-exome sequencing provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients referred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations contributing to disease. The yield of whole-exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular diagnostic approaches in certain patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Organizational factors influencing failure-to-rescue (FTR)-or death after postoperative complications-are poorly understood. Case studies were conducted to generate hypotheses that could inform future FTR research and improvement strategies.; METHODS: Publicly reported 2009-2011 data were used to identify 144 outlier hospitals with statistically better or worse FTR performance than the national average. Of these 144 hospitals, 7 were selected for case studies in a purposive sample. Outliers enabled a focus on the organizational factors and processes at the extremes of performance. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013 with key informants at each hospital, and transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method to identify emergent organizational behavioral themes.; RESULTS: The 7 hospitals-4 high- and 3 low-performing-yielded 106 interviews. Critical barriers to effective rescue were ineffective communication, lack of psychological safety, staffing discontinuity, imbalance of shared ownership and individual responsibility, lack of appropriate training and education, and difficulty using current metrics. Participants also identified strategies to overcome these barriers-rapid response teams, flattening the hierarchy, escalation strategies, health information technology, structured communication tools, constant team structures, standardized care pathways, and organizational learning.; CONCLUSION: FTR is a complex process that is viewed, defined, and acted on differently across and within organizations. Early recognition of patients deviating from normal recovery was enhanced in high-performing hospitals through the use of standardized postoperative recovery pathways and automated escalation protocols. Current FTR measures may be less actionable for the purposes of quality improvement.

AB Over the last few years, the use of molecular profiling to direct patients to specific targeted therapies has irrevocably changed how we treat lung cancer. Despite this, many randomized trials have failed to show an apparent survival advantage from this approach in stage IV disease. Are we using targeted therapy for no real benefit, lulled into a false sense of security by impressive radiographic responsesonly to shorten the patients life later? Of course not, as anyone who treats lung cancer patients can tell by how the quality and quantity of our patients lives have improved in the last few years. Profound and durable responses now can be achieved in an increasing proportion of patients across a range of actionable abnormalities; historical trends and meta-analyses of trials all suggest the overall survival benefit is really there; and, when large populations are explored, key subsets of patients, who are likely to be the ones harboring the most actionable molecular markers, are now living longer than they did before targeted therapies were available. Is it easy to point to a single irrefutable piece of evidence proving the survival benefit of targeted therapy in lung cancer? No, but it is also impossible to ignore.

AB CONTEXT: Outpatient programs have been traditionally offered in the U.S. under programs such as the Medicare Hospice Benefit. Recommendations now emphasize a blended model in which palliative care is offered concurrently with curative approaches at the onset of serious or life-limiting disease. The efficacy of nonhospice outpatient palliative care programs is not well understood.; OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical impact of a home-based palliative care program, Home Connections, implemented as a partnership between a not-for-profit hospice and two private insurers.; METHODS: This was a prospective, observational, database study of 499 Home Connections participants enrolled between July 1, 2008, and May 31, 2013. Measured outcomes were advance directive completion, site of death, symptom severity over time, program satisfaction, and hospice referral and average length of stay.; RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of participants completed actionable advance directives after enrollment, and the site of death was home for 47% of those who died during or after participation in the program. Six of eight symptom domains (anxiety, appetite, dyspnea, well-being, depression, and nausea) showed improvement. Patients, caregivers, and physicians gave high program satisfaction scores (93%-96%). Home Connections participants who subsequently enrolled in hospice care had a longer average length of stay of 77.9 days compared with all other hospice referrals (average length of stay 56.5 days).; CONCLUSION: A home-based palliative care program was developed between two local commercial payers and a not-for-profit hospice. Not only did this program improve symptom management, advance directive completion, and satisfaction, but it also facilitated the transition of patients into hospice care, when appropriate.

AB Dashboards are data-driven clinical decision support tools used to analyze data from multiple databases using easy-to-read, color-coded graphical displays, much like the dashboards of automobiles. Dashboards can be used to promote data-driven decision making and improve adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines. The purpose of this article was to provide a review of dashboards used to query electronic health records for the purpose of guiding clinical practice and research. An inductive content analysis approach was used to identify emerging themes directly from the literature. Five basic dashboard properties identified include the type of database integration, visual properties, purpose, time focus (ie, retrospective, real time, or predictive), and type of process monitored. These dashboard properties are determined by the characteristics of the specific organization, user, and purpose of data analysis. Using dashboards to perform automated analytical reviews of clinical data will prove more efficient when data elements stored in electronic health records become standardized. Other limitations of dashboard use include user anxiety, information overload, and technology overload. The increased use of electronic documentation in healthcare settings will provide a wealth of data, and dashboards will play a pivotal role in converting these data into actionable knowledge.

AB It is increasingly well recognized that the design and operation of the communities in which people live, work, learn, and play significantly influence their health. However, within the real estate industry, the health impacts of transportation, community development, and other construction projects, both positive and negative, continue to operate largely as economic externalities: unmeasured, unregulated, and for the most part unconsidered. This lack of transparency limits communities' ability to efficiently advocate for real estate investment that best promotes their health and well-being. It also limits market incentives for innovation within the real estate industry by making it more difficult for developers that successfully target health behaviors and outcomes in their projects to differentiate themselves competitively. In this article we outline the need for actionable, community-relevant, practical, and valuable metrics jointly developed by the health care and real estate sectors to better evaluate and optimize the "performance" of real estate development projects from a population health perspective. Potential templates for implementation, including the successful introduction of sustainability metrics by the green building movement, and preliminary data from selected case-study projects are also discussed.

AB We present a precision medicine application developed for multiple sclerosis (MS): the MS BioScreen. This new tool addresses the challenges of dynamic management of a complex chronic disease; the interaction of clinicians and patients with such a tool illustrates the extent to which translational digital medicine-that is, the application of information technology to medicine-has the potential to radically transform medical practice. We introduce 3 key evolutionary phases in displaying data to health care providers, patients, and researchers: visualization (accessing data), contextualization (understanding the data), and actionable interpretation (real-time use of the data to assist decision making). Together, these form the stepping stones that are expected to accelerate standardization of data across platforms, promote evidence-based medicine, support shared decision making, and ultimately lead to improved outcomes. © 2014 American Neurological Association.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess manpower and resource consumption of the HomeGuide workflow model for remote monitoring (Biotronik Home Monitoring [HM], Biotronik SE & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) of cardiac implantable electronic devices in daily clinical practice.; METHODS: The model established a cooperative interaction between a reference nurse (RN) for ordinary management, and a responsible physician (RP) for medical decisions in each outpatient clinic. RN reviewed remote transmissions and alerts, addressing critical cases to the RP.; RESULTS: A total of 1,650 patients were enrolled in 75 sites: 25% pacemakers (PM), 22% dual-, 27% single-chamber implantable defibrillators (ICD), 2% PM with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and 24% ICD-CRT. During a median follow-up of 18 (10-31) months, 3,364 HM sessions were performed (74% by the RN, 26% by the RP) to complete 18,478 remote follow-ups. Median duration of remote follow-ups was 1.2 (0.6-2.0) minutes, corresponding to a manpower of 43.3 (4.2-94.8) minutes/month every 100 patients for nurses and 10.2 (0.1-31.1) for physicians (P < 0.0001). RN submitted 15% of remote transmissions to RP, who decided unscheduled follow-ups in 12% of the cases. The median manpower for phone calls was 1.9 (0.8-16.5) minutes/month every 100 contacted patients. There were 2.84 in-hospital visits/patient, 0.46 of which triggered by HM findings. A cumulative per-patient HM follow-up time of 15.4 minutes (20% of total follow-up time) allowed remote detection of 73% of actionable events.; CONCLUSIONS: HM implemented in the HomeGuide workflow model required <1 hour/month every 100 patients to detect the majority of actionable events with limited administrative workload. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Multiple-point glucose profiles are now acknowledged, in the diabetes literature, as a key way for people with diabetes to analyze and interpret blood glucose control (BGC).(1-3) Combined methods to visualize relevant blood glucose information are increasingly recognized as a more effective method of explaining actionable glucose profiles.(4,15(p564)) This commentary is written from the perspective of a person with type 1 diabetes and might add value to the existing understanding about relevant ways to display BGC data. Through discussion of the limits to current multiple-point glucose displays, for example, AGP "dashboard," a proposed alternative method of graphical display that brings together HbA1c and self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) test data is presented. © 2014 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB Sequencing of the entire exome or genome is increasingly used in clinical practice. Debate continues, however, regarding which incidental findings (IFs) should be returned and who should be involved in those decisions. Previous empirical research regarding stakeholder attitudes to the return of IFs has primarily involved genetics professionals; non-genetics health professionals have not been widely surveyed. Given this, a survey regarding return of IFs was administered at the Best Practices in Pediatrics Conference following an educational presentation on genetics terminology and genetic condition examples. A total of 258 participants completed the survey. Of particular note, respondents who were positively disposed to sequencing did not always report wanting to learn about IFs, even if actionable. This is noteworthy given recent American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines recommending particular actionable IF be returned 'without reference to patient preference'. This study's findings are important because they provide insight regarding the attitudes to the return of genome sequencing results for an important professional group, primary care providers. Ultimately, as likely gatekeepers to referrals for this technology, their opinions about the test will be key to its successful deployment.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB Disaster epidemiology (i.e., applied epidemiology in disaster settings) presents a source of reliable and actionable information for decision-makers and stakeholders in the disaster management cycle. However, epidemiological methods have yet to be routinely integrated into disaster response and fully communicated to response leaders. We present a framework consisting of rapid needs assessments, health surveillance, tracking and registries, and epidemiological investigations, including risk factor and health outcome studies and evaluation of interventions, which can be practiced throughout the cycle. Applying each method can result in actionable information for planners and decision-makers responsible for preparedness, response, and recovery. Disaster epidemiology, once integrated into the disaster management cycle, can provide the evidence base to inform and enhance response capability within the public health infrastructure.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pharmacogenomics is the study of differences in drug response on the basis of individual genetic background. With rapidly advancing genomic technologies and decreased costs of genotyping, the field of pharmacogenomics continues to develop. Application to patients with kidney disease provides growing opportunities for improving drug therapy.; RECENT FINDINGS: Pharmacogenomics studies are lacking in patients with chronic kidney disease and dialysis, but are abundant in the kidney transplant field. A potentially clinically actionable genetic variant exists in the CYP3A5 gene, with the initial tacrolimus dose selection being optimized based on CYP3A5 genotype. Although many pharmacogenomics studies have focused on transplant immunosuppression pharmacokinetics, an expanding literature on pharmacodynamic outcomes, such as calcineurin inhibitor toxicity and new onset diabetes, is providing new information on patients at risk.; SUMMARY: Appropriately powered pharmacogenomics studies with well-defined phenotypes are needed to validate existing studies and unearth new findings in patients with kidney disease, especially the chronic kidney disease and dialysis population.

AB AIM: Screening for cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and neuropsychiatric problems is not always performed in children with epilepsy. The aim of this study was to assess the value of this screening and its validity for determining previously unidentified ('actionable') problems in children with epilepsy.; METHOD: New and existing patients with epilepsy were recruited from a hospital-based epilepsy center. The parent of the child completed screening evaluations for development (Ages and Stages Questionnaire [ASQ], 0-66mo), autism (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers [mCHAT], 16-30mo), social communication (Social Communication Questionnaire [SCQ], ≥4y), and psychiatric concerns (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ], 4-17y).; RESULTS: We screened 236 children overall (136 males [58%], 100 females [42%]; mean age [SD] 6y 7mo [4y 6mo]). Of these, 176 children (75%) had established epilepsy diagnoses and 60 (25%) were patients with new-onset epilepsy. Of those with new-onset disease, 22 (37%) were determined not to have epilepsy. Positive findings by test were 82% (ASQ), 54% (mCHAT), 15%, (SCQ), and 58% (SDQ). Findings were actionable in 46 children (20%): 18% of findings in children with established epilepsy and 23% of findings in patients with new-onset epilepsy. Of the 46 children for whom further referrals were made, the parents of 28 (61%) have pursued further evaluations.; INTERPRETATION: In this study, children with existing and new-onset diagnoses of epilepsy had actionable screening findings. These findings support the development of systematic screening of comorbidities for children with epilepsy. © 2014 Mac Keith Press.

AB The focus of the great majority of climate change impact studies is on changes in mean climate. In terms of climate model output, these changes are more robust than changes in climate variability. By concentrating on changes in climate means, the full impacts of climate change on biological and human systems are probably being seriously underestimated. Here, we briefly review the possible impacts of changes in climate variability and the frequency of extreme events on biological and food systems, with a focus on the developing world. We present new analysis that tentatively links increases in climate variability with increasing food insecurity in the future. We consider the ways in which people deal with climate variability and extremes and how they may adapt in the future. Key knowledge and data gaps are highlighted. These include the timing and interactions of different climatic stresses on plant growth and development, particularly at higher temperatures, and the impacts on crops, livestock and farming systems of changes in climate variability and extreme events on pest-weed-disease complexes. We highlight the need to reframe research questions in such a way that they can provide decision makers throughout the food system with actionable answers, and the need for investment in climate and environmental monitoring. Improved understanding of the full range of impacts of climate change on biological and food systems is a critical step in being able to address effectively the effects of climate variability and extreme events on human vulnerability and food security, particularly in agriculturally based developing countries facing the challenge of having to feed rapidly growing populations in the coming decades.  © 2014 The Authors.

AB Ongoing cancer genome characterization studies continue to elucidate the spectrum of genomic abnormalities that drive many cancers, and in the clinical arena assessment of the driver genetic alterations in patients is playing an increasingly important diagnostic and/or prognostic role for many cancer types. However, the landscape of genomic abnormalities is still unknown for less common cancers, and the influence of specific genotypes on clinical behavior is often still unclear. To address some of these deficiencies, we developed Profile, a prospective cohort study to obtain genomic information on all patients at a large tertiary care medical center for cancer-related care. We enrolled patients with any cancer diagnosis, and, for each patient (unselected for cancer site or type) we applied mass spectrometric genotyping (OncoMap) of 471 common recurrent mutations in 41 cancer-related genes. We report the results of the first 5000 patients, of which 26% exhibited potentially actionable somatic mutations. These observations indicate the utility of genotyping in advancing the field of precision oncology.

AB BACKGROUND: Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a highly aggressive subtype of salivary gland cancers and there is no established standard therapy for this disease. Thus, development of molecular markers for SDC will be important to guide the diagnosis and therapy of this aggressive tumor.; METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq cancer panel, which explores the mutational status of hotspot regions in 50 cancer-associated genes, and we analyzed copy number variations (CNVs) of 21 genes by NanoString nCounter for 37 patients with SDC. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was also conducted to confirm ERBB2 gene amplification. Clinical records and tumor histopathology of the patients were retrospectively reviewed.; RESULTS: Genetic alterations were detected in 29 of 37 (78.3%) tumors, including mutations in PIK3CA (N = 9, 24.3%), ERBB2 (N = 4, 10.8%), and EGFR (N = 4, 10.8%). To our knowledge, this is the first time that ERBB2 mutations have been reported in this tumor type. Both PIK3CA and ERBB2 mutation status were associated with poor overall survival, but without statistical significance. ERBB2 amplification was strong and common in SDC and almost all cases also exhibited EGFR and ERBB3 amplifications.; CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the largest and most comprehensive analysis of DNA aberrations in SDC. Our results show that PIK3CA and/or ERBB2 alterations in the development of SDC might be a useful diagnostic tool and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

AB The recent elucidation of the genomic landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has provided a unique opportunity to develop selective cancer treatment options. These efforts will require the establishment of relevant HNSCC models for preclinical testing. Here, we performed full exome and transcriptome sequencing of a large panel of HNSCC-derived cells from different anatomical locations and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status. These cells exhibit typical mutations in TP53, FAT1, CDK2NA, CASP8, and NOTCH1, and copy number variations (CNVs) and mutations in PIK3CA, HRAS, and PTEN that reflect the widespread activation of the PI3K-mTOR pathway. SMAD4 alterations were observed that may explain the decreased tumor suppressive effect of TGF-beta in HNSCC. Surprisingly, we identified HPV+ HNSCC cells harboring TP53 mutations, and documented aberrant TP53 expression in a subset of HPV+ HNSCC cases. This analysis also revealed that most HNSCC cells harbor multiple mutations and CNVs in epigenetic modifiers (e.g., EP300, CREBP, MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, KDM6A, and KDM6B) that may contribute to HNSCC initiation and progression. These genetically-defined experimental HNSCC cellular systems, together with the identification of novel actionable molecular targets, may now facilitate the pre-clinical evaluation of emerging therapeutic agents in tumors exhibiting each precise genomic alteration.

AB How malignant gliomas arise in a mature brain remains a mystery, hindering the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions. We previously showed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can be transformed into glioma when mutations are introduced perinatally. However, adult OPCs rarely proliferate compared with their perinatal counterparts. Whether these relatively quiescent cells have the potential to transform is unknown, which is a critical question considering the late onset of human glioma. Additionally, the premalignant events taking place between initial mutation and a fully developed tumor mass are particularly poorly understood in glioma. Here we used a temporally controllable Cre transgene to delete p53 and NF1 specifically in adult OPCs and demonstrated that these cells consistently give rise to malignant gliomas. To investigate the transforming process of quiescent adult OPCs, we then tracked these cells throughout the premalignant phase, which revealed a dynamic multistep transformation, starting with rapid but transient hyperproliferative reactivation, followed by a long period of dormancy, and then final malignant transformation. Using pharmacological approaches, we discovered that mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is critical for both the initial OPC reactivation step and late-stage tumor cell proliferation and thus might be a potential target for both glioma prevention and treatment. In summary, our results firmly establish the transforming potential of adult OPCs and reveal an actionable multiphasic reactivation process that turns slowly dividing OPCs into malignant gliomas.

AB Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an infectious cancer occurring in immune-compromised patients, caused by Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Our vision is to simplify the process of KS diagnosis through the creation of a smartphone based point-of-care system capable of yielding an actionable diagnostic readout starting from a raw biopsy sample. In this work we develop the sensing mechanism for the overall system, a smartphone accessory capable of detecting KSHV nucleic acids. The accessory reads out microfluidic chips filled with a colorimetric nanoparticle assay targeted at KSHV. We calculate that our final device can read out gold nanoparticle solutions with an accuracy of 0.05 OD, and we demonstrate that it can detect DNA sequences from KSHV down to 1 nM. We believe that through integration with our previously developed components, a smartphone based system like the one studied here can provide accurate detection information, as well as a simple platform for field based clinical diagnosis and research.

AB BACKGROUND: Mortality reviews are a foundation of inpatient quality improvement (QI), but low levels of harm among a random or sequential sample may not yield actionable improvement opportunities. To increase the efficiency of mortality reviews at identifying QI opportunities, Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) developed a condition-specific hybrid electronic/manual chart review called the "e-autopsy."; METHODS: KPSC hospital deaths are filtered electronically by predetermined criteria. Teams consisting of a registered nurse and physician trained in QI at each hospital then manually review selected charts using a structured data-extraction tool to identify gaps in provision of evidence-based care. Results are aggregated and studied to identify improvement opportunities.; RESULTS: E-autopsy has identified opportunities amenable to system improvements. The first e-autopsy of all KPSC members who died with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a KPSC hospital indicated that many patients meeting criteria had not been screened for AAA. This study showed KPSC leaders the value of point-of-care electronic decision support to increase evidence-based AAA screening and of a tracking system for patients with positive results. Screening among high-risk patients in 2012 increased by more than 8,000 individuals, compared with the annual average during the previous four years. E-autopsies have also been conducted of patients who died with aspiration pneumonia; after unplanned transfers to the ICU; and after diagnosis of colon cancer.; CONCLUSION: E-autopsy reveals actionable opportunities to improve care systems, complementing other QI activities. This hybrid electronic/manual process can be applied to a wide variety of patient conditions and settings.

AB BACKGROUND: Use of genome sequencing in the clinic continues to increase. In addition to its potential to provide findings of clinical benefit, it also has the potential to identify findings unrelated to the indication for testing (incidental findings). Incidental findings are the subject of considerable debate, particularly following the publication of recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. This debate involves how and which results should be returned as well as stakeholders' desires for such results. Part of the difficulty in determining best practice in relation to returning incidental findings is the dearth of empirical data available regarding laypersons' attitudes and desire for the sometimes controversial information.; METHODS: In an effort to contribute data on views regarding the return of incidental findings following genome sequencing in a clinical setting, a survey specifically designed around the various types of incidental findings that occur, ranging from clinically actionable to nonactionable, was administered to a nonmedical population of medical coders working at a medical school (N = 97). Almost all (98%) of the respondents were women, 80% had 6 or more years of experience as a medical coder, and about three-fourths (74%) of participants reported that they had children.; RESULTS: The group surveyed was considerably more interested in receiving all types of results for both themselves and their children than previously surveyed genetics professionals.; CONCLUSION: Results from this study offer a snapshot of opinions beyond those of the professional genetic community and demonstrate a striking difference between genetic professionals and a more lay population in terms of their attitudes and desires regarding the return of incidental findings. Additional research is needed to explain the nuances in the perspectives motivating these variations.

AB Heart failure is a syndrome with a pathophysiological basis that can be traced to dysfunction in several interconnected molecular pathways. Identification of biomarkers of heart failure that allow measurement of the disease on a molecular level has resulted in enthusiasm for their use in prognostication and selection of appropriate therapies. However, despiteconsiderable amounts of information available on numerous biomarkers, inconsistent research methodologies and lack of clinical correlations have made bench-to-bedside translations rare and left the literature with countless publications of varied quality. There is a need for a systematic and collaborative approach aimed at definitively studying the clinical benefits of novel biomarkers. In this review, on the basis of input from academia, industry, and governmental agencies, we propose a systematized approach based on adherence to specific quality measures for studies looking to augment current prediction model or use biomarkers to tailor therapeutics. We suggest that study quality, rather than results, should determine publication and propose a system for grading biomarker studies. We outline the need for collaboration between clinical investigators and statisticians to introduce more advanced statistical methodologies into the field of biomarkers that would allow for data from a large number of variables to be distilled into clinically actionable information. Lastly, we propose the creation of a heart failure biomarker consortium that would allow for a comprehensive list of biomarkers to be concomitantly analyzed in a pooled sample of randomized clinical trials and hypotheses to be generated for testing in biomarker-guided trials. Such a consortium could collaborate in sharing samples to identify biomarkers, undertake meta-analyses on completed trials, and spearhead clinical trials to test the clinical utility of new biomarkers.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become an important tool for identifying clinically relevant variants in both inherited disorders and oncology. Variants annotation that enables the creation of meaningful clinical reports often requires mining multiple publicly available databases. There are a number of such resources that have been designed to catalog and mine a plethora of germline variants or mutations. However, when analyzing tumor specimens in clinical settings, one may need to use different or ancillary resources that are specific for somatic variants or actionable mutations that may have clinical or treatment implications. The purpose of this review is to recapitulate the state of the art of somatic variation databases, which can aid in the clinical interpretation of NGS-based assays in oncology. In addition, the current need for collating various annotation sources into one-stop solutions to facilitate faster query execution and better integration into existing laboratory information systems are discussed. © 2014 The Authors.

AB Comments on the articles by A. E. Skodol et al. (see record 2013-24395-001), E. Ronningstam (see record 2014-42878-005), D. Diamond et al. (see record 2014-42878-004), and A. L. Pincus et al. (see record 2014-01439-001). Good delineation of the phenomenology of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is necessary but insufficient for informing us on what to do clinically. Perry suspects that we will see reams of publications comparing Section III and II diagnoses with various external measures and possibly experimental procedures. We will learn some important things, along with many facts without actionable consequences. However, because NPD does not show many differential relationships to particular functional measures, I believe that treatment studies will likely be the most informative.

AB OBJECTIVES: This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated a telepharmacy service model using a conceptual framework to compare documented remote pharmacist interventions by year, hospital, and remote pharmacist and across rural hospitals with or without an on-site rural hospital pharmacist.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Documented remote pharmacist interventions for patients at eight rural hospitals in the Midwestern United States during prospective prescription order review/entry from 2008 to 2011 were extracted from RxFusion() database (a home-grown system, i.e., internally developed program at The Nebraska Medical Center (TNMC) for capturing remote pharmacist-documented intervention data). The study authors conceptualized an analytical framework, mapping the 37 classes of remote pharmacist interventions to three broader-level definitions: (a) intervention, eight categories (interaction/potential interaction, contraindication, adverse effects, anticoagulation monitoring, drug product selection, drug regimen, summary, and recommendation), (b) patient medication management, two categories (therapy review and action), and (c) health system-centered medication use process, four categories (prescribing, transcribing and documenting, administering, and monitoring). Frequencies of intervention levels were compared by year, hospital, remote pharmacist, and hospital pharmacy status (with a remote pharmacist and on-site pharmacist or with a remote pharmacist only) using chi-squared test and univariate logistic regression analyses, as appropriate.; RESULTS: For 450,000 prescription orders 19,222 remote pharmacist interventions were documented. Frequency of interventions significantly increased each year (36% in 2009, 55% in 2010, and 7% in 2011) versus the baseline year (2008, 3%) when service started. The frequency of interventions also differed significantly across the eight hospitals and 16 remote pharmacists for the three defined intervention levels and categories. Remote pharmacist interventions at hospitals with an on-site and remote pharmacist (n=12,141) versus those with a remote pharmacist alone (n=7,081) were significantly more likely to be (1) patient-centered, (2) related to "actionable" medication management recommendations (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.12), and (3) related to the "transcribing" (OR=1.47) and "prescribing" (OR=1.40) steps of the health system-centered medication use process level (all p<0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to demonstrate the patient- and health system-centered nature of pharmaceutical care delivered via a telepharmacy service model by evaluating documented remote pharmacist interventions with an analytical framework.

AB BACKGROUND: Molecular testing for oncogenic gene mutations and chromosomal rearrangements plays a growing role in the optimal management of thyroid nodules, yet lacks standardized testing modalities and systematic validation data. Our objective was to assess the performance of molecular cytology on preoperative thyroid nodule fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) across a broad range of variables, including independent collection sites, clinical practices, and anatomic pathology interpretations.; METHODS: Single-pass FNAs were prospectively collected from 806 nodules 1cm or larger by ultrasonography at five independent sites across the United States. Specimens were shipped in a nucleic acid stabilization solution and tested at a centralized clinical laboratory. Seventeen genetic alterations (BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS mutations, PAX8-PPARG and RET-PTC rearrangements) were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and liquid bead array cytometry in 769 FNAs that met inclusion criteria. Cytology, histology, and clinical care followed local procedures and practices. All results were double-blinded.; RESULTS: Thirty-two specimens (4.2%) failed to yield sufficient nucleic acid to generate molecular data. A single genetic alteration was detected in 80% of cytology malignant cases, 21% of indeterminate, 7.8% of nondiagnostic, and 3.5% of benign cases. Among 109 nodules with surgical histology reference standard, oncogenic mutations were present in 50% of malignant nodules missed by cytology. There were 14 cancers not identified by cytology or molecular tests, including 5 carcinomas with histologic sizes less than 1cm (3 multifocal) and 8 noninvasive follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (4 encapsulated). No mutations were detected in 89% of the nodules benign by histopathology with 6 false-positive molecular results in 5 adenomas (2-5.5cm) and 1 cystic nodule with an incidental papillary microcarcinoma (0.15cm). The posttest probability of thyroid cancer was 100% for nodules positive for BRAF or RET-PTC, 70% for RAS or PAX8-PPARG, and 88% for molecular cytology overall.; CONCLUSIONS: Centralized and standardized molecular testing for genetic alterations associated with a high risk of malignancy efficiently complements the local cytopathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodule aspirates in the clinical setting. Actionable molecular cytology can improve the personalized surgical and medical management of patients with thyroid cancers, facilitating one-stage total thyroidectomy and reducing the number of unnecessary diagnostic surgeries.

AB Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common actionable genetic abnormalities yet discovered in lung cancer. However, targeting these mutations with kinase inhibitors is not curative in advanced disease and has yet to demonstrate an impact on potentially curable, early-stage disease, with some data suggesting adverse outcomes. Here, we report that treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines with erlotinib, while showing robust cell death, enriches the ALDH(+) stem-like cells through EGFR-dependent activation of Notch3. In addition, we demonstrate that erlotinib treatment increases the clonogenicity of lung cancer cells in a sphere-forming assay, suggesting increased stem-like cell potential. We demonstrate that inhibition of EGFR kinase activity leads to activation of Notch transcriptional targets in a gamma secretase inhibitor-sensitive manner and causes Notch activation, leading to an increase in ALDH high(+) cells. We also find a kinase-dependent physical association between the Notch3 and EGFR receptors and tyrosine phosphorylation of Notch3. This could explain the worsened survival observed in some studies of erlotinib treatment at early-stage disease, and suggests that specific dual targeting might overcome this adverse effect. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB INTRODUCTION: Drug prescriptions represent an actionable item in the prevention of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aims of this study were to identify risk factors for the occurrence of ADRs, and to describe symptoms and drug interactions.; METHODS: This was a longitudinal study over a period of 19 months in an acute geriatric ward specializing in the management of dementia. Independent risk factors for ADRs were identified by logistic regression. Drug interactions were also recorded.; RESULTS: In total, 293 patients were included (age 82 ± 8 years). The prevalence of ADRs was 24 %. Patients were taking 8 ± 3 drugs per day; 72 (24.6 %) were taking more than three psychotropics. The main therapeutic classes prescribed were anxiolytics and hypnotics (57.7 %), antidementia drugs (54.6 %), antidepressants (54.3 %), antithrombotics (54.0 %), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs] (37.5 %). The risk of ADRs was significantly higher in patients taking neuroleptics (odds ratio [OR] 2.04; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.06-3.92), ACEIs/ARBs (OR 2.07; 95 % CI 1.13-3.77) and antidementia drugs (OR 1.84; 95 % CI 1.01-3.36). The risk of serious ADRs was significantly higher in patients taking ACEIs/ARBs (OR 2.95; 95 % CI 1.40-6.21), type I, III or IV antiarrhythmics (OR 2.71; 95 % CI 1.07-6.88) or neuroleptics (OR 2.42; 95 % CI 1.09-5.40). Drug interactions were involved in 26.3 % (n = 21) of ADRs; the combination of an ADR plus a drug interaction was associated with increased severity (p = 0.02).; CONCLUSION: Caution is needed when prescribing ACEIs/ARBs, neuroleptics, antidementia drugs, or certain types of antiarrhythmics in patients suffering from dementia. Psychotropics should be avoided because of the associated risk of ADRs and drug interactions.

AB AIMS: The Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) classification has been proposed by consensus to standardize bleeding endpoint definition and reporting in cardiovascular clinical trials. There are no prospective studies on its prognostic impact.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We explored the association of BARC-defined bleeding with mortality and compared its prognostic value against two validated bleeding scales: the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) scales. Non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)-related bleedings within the PRODIGY trial were prospectively adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Event Committee and analysed according to multiple statistical modelling. At 2 years, bleeding occurred in 143 patients (7.1%) according to BARC Type 2, 3, or 5; in 50 patients (2.5%) according to TIMI minor or major; and in 61 patients (3.1%) according to GUSTO moderate or severe. One hundred sixty-three patients died (8.1%). After multivariable modelling, BARC Type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding was associated with increased 2-year mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 3.77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.37-5.98]. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 3 or 5 was associated with an increased mortality rate at 2 years (adjusted HR: 7.72; 95% CI: 4.75-12.54) similar to that provided by TIMI (HR: 7.64, 95% CI: 4.53-12.87) or GUSTO (HR: 7.36, 95% CI: 4.38-12.34) criteria.; CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary, all-comer percutaneous coronary intervention trial actionable BARC bleedings were associated with increased risk of mortality with BARC Type 3 or 5 bleedings providing a similar mortality risk to that posed by TIMI or GUSTO scales.

AB Rising health care costs will result in reduced payments to providers, but across-the-board provider payment reductions are not the answer. Instead, existing payment systems should be reformed to strengthen value for the dollars spent. This can be accomplished by increasing efficiency, improving quality and outcomes, and lowering costs. Payment system reforms must be practical, transparent, identify opportunities for care improvement, and demonstrate material cost savings. Most importantly, because the current growth in health care costs is unsustainable, these reforms must be able to be implemented today. A set of comprehensive measures is being used by state government and private payers in the United States to adjust payment, based on improved outcomes quality. This article details the use of this set of measures, referred to as potentially preventable events, and demonstrates how they are being applied to achieve health care value.

AB Numerous solid malignancies have been reported to contain cancer stem cells (CSCs). Distinct functional characteristics have been attributed to CSCs, and thus it is widely believed that these unique cells may have genetic and phenotypic homogeneity. Recent exciting but limited evidence, however, contradicts this tenet and supports the intriguing concept of genetic and phenotypic diversity in the CSC population. We propose that CSC heterogeneity at the inter- and intrapatient levels may be due to the cell of origin, to environmental cues, and/or to human papillomavirus infection. Additional insight into CSC heterogeneity is needed to identify actionable targets for optimal eradication of the diverse CSC subpopulations within a tumor. ©AlphaMed Press.

AB To identify actionable opportunities for improving Partner Notification (PN) for HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), we characterized the perspectives and experiences of PN among Medical Case Managers (case managers), Disease Intervention Specialists (DIS), and MSM. In partnership with an AIDS service organization and the Connecticut State Health Department, we conducted a focus group of case managers (n = 14) and in-depth interviews with DIS (n = 7) and MSM (n = 24). We found differences between MSM's and providers' (case managers and DIS) perspectives regarding (1) determinants of sexual risk behaviors; (2) considerations impacting HIV disclosure; and (3) barriers to trusting relationships between MSM and providers. Factors impacting MSM perspectives on PN were incompletely appreciated by both case managers and DIS. PN may be improved through improving provider understanding of the complexities for MSM regarding sexual risk behaviors and disclosure and transcending barriers to trusting relationships between MSM and providers.

AB MOTIVATION: Computational methods are essential to extract actionable information from raw sequencing data, and to thus fulfill the promise of next-generation sequencing technology. Unfortunately, computational tools developed to call variants from human sequencing data disagree on many of their predictions, and current methods to evaluate accuracy and computational performance are ad hoc and incomplete. Agreement on benchmarking variant calling methods would stimulate development of genomic processing tools and facilitate communication among researchers.; RESULTS: We propose SMaSH, a benchmarking methodology for evaluating germline variant calling algorithms. We generate synthetic datasets, organize and interpret a wide range of existing benchmarking data for real genomes and propose a set of accuracy and computational performance metrics for evaluating variant calling methods on these benchmarking data. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of SMaSH to evaluate the performance of some leading single-nucleotide polymorphism, indel and structural variant calling algorithms.; AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We provide free and open access online to the SMaSH tool kit, along with detailed documentation, at smash.cs.berkeley.edu © The Author 2014.

AB BACKGROUND: The advent of clinical next generation sequencing is rapidly changing the landscape of rare disease medicine. Molecular diagnosis of long QT syndrome (LQTS) can affect clinical management, including risk stratification and selection of pharmacotherapy on the basis of the type of ion channel affected, but results from the current gene panel testing requires 4-16 weeks before return to clinicians.; OBJECTIVE: A term female infant presented with 2:1 atrioventricular block and ventricular arrhythmias consistent with perinatal LQTS, requiring aggressive treatment including epicardial pacemaker and cardioverter-defibrillator implantation and sympathectomy on day of life 2. We sought to provide a rapid molecular diagnosis for the optimization of treatment strategies.; METHODS: We performed Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) with a speed-optimized bioinformatics platform to achieve molecular diagnosis at 10 days of life.; RESULTS: We detected a known pathogenic variant in KCNH2 that was demonstrated to be paternally inherited by follow-up genotyping. The unbiased assessment of the entire catalog of human genes provided by WGS revealed a maternally inherited variant of unknown significance in a novel gene.; CONCLUSION: Rapid clinical WGS provides faster and more comprehensive diagnostic information at 10 days of life than does standard gene panel testing. In selected clinical scenarios such as perinatal LQTS, rapid WGS can provide more timely and clinically actionable information than can a standard commercial test.

AB Delivering on the promise of personalized medicine has become a focus of the pharmaceutical industry as the era of the blockbuster drug is fading. Central to realizing this promise is the need for improved analytical strategies for effectively integrating information across various biological assays (for example, copy number variation and targeted protein expression) toward identification of a treatment-specific subgroup-identifying the right patients. We propose a novel combination of elastic net followed by a maximal chi(2) and semiparametric bootstrap. The combined approaches are presented in a two-stage strategy that estimates patient-specific multi-marker molecular signatures (MMMS) to identify and directly test for a biomarker-driven subgroup with enhanced treatment effect. This flexible strategy provides for incorporation of business-specific needs, such as confining the search space to a subgroup size that is commercially viable, ultimately resulting in actionable information for use in empirically based decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic alterations in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients are not well-understood.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surgical specimens and tumor biopsies from 42 patients with MPM were collected from 2003 to 2012. The samples were analyzed for mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2 and amplifications in EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2. In addition, 21 patients' samples were analyzed using amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing for actionable mutations in 48 cancer-related genes.; RESULTS: Genetic alterations were detected in 4 patients (one KRAS mutation and 3 PIK3CA amplifications). Patients harboring genetic alterations showed significantly poorer survival than patients with no genetic alterations. Moreover, significance was maintained if the patients only harbored PIK3CA amplification. A total 16 genetic mutations were identified in the 9 patients' samples (4 TP53 mutations, 3 APC mutations, 3 PIK3CA mutations, and 2 VHL mutations, etc.) by deep sequencing.; CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations that are potential targets for molecular targeted therapy were detected in MPM. Amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing was shown to have the advantage of more comprehensive genetic analysis. Further investigation in a larger cohort is necessary to uncover more targetable genetic alterations in MPM and to validate their clinical significance. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In healthcare, big data tools and technologies have the potential to create significant value by improving outcomes while lowering costs for each individual patient. Diagnostic images, genetic test results and biometric information are increasingly generated and stored in electronic health records presenting us with challenges in data that is by nature high volume, variety and velocity, thereby necessitating novel ways to store, manage and process big data. This presents an urgent need to develop new, scalable and expandable big data infrastructure and analytical methods that can enable healthcare providers access knowledge for the individual patient, yielding better decisions and outcomes. In this paper, we briefly discuss the nature of big data and the role of semantic web and data analysis for generating "smart data" which offer actionable information that supports better decision for personalized medicine. In our view, the biggest challenge is to create a system that makes big data robust and smart for healthcare providers and patients that can lead to more effective clinical decision-making, improved health outcomes, and ultimately, managing the healthcare costs. We highlight some of the challenges in using big data and propose the need for a semantic data-driven environment to address them. We illustrate our vision with practical use cases, and discuss a path for empowering personalized medicine using big data and semantic web technology.

AB PURPOSE: Efforts to advance the ASHP Pharmacy Practice Model Initiative (PPMI) in the Michigan Society of Health-System Pharmacists (MSHP) are described.; SUMMARY: After the Pharmacy Practice Model Summit in November 2010, the board of directors of MSHP began to strategize ways to help health-system pharmacists in Michigan achieve the vision and concepts envisioned by the PPMI. The ultimate goal was to develop a process for acting on recommendations developed by the PPMI to advance the practice of health-system pharmacy in Michigan. A task force was formed and reviewed the 147 national recommendations from the ASHP Pharmacy Practice Model Summit and grouped them into related areas of focus. Six focus areas were identified: acute care, ambulatory care, education and training, organizational affairs and leadership, pharmacy technicians, and technology and information systems. A PPMI Michigan conference was arranged in which focus groups would assess these six areas. Each focus group was limited to six or seven participants, with a member of the task force serving as the facilitator for the group. Individual focus groups then formulated recommendations MSHP could develop into actionable strategies to address the key issues identified during the morning session. A total of 56 recommendations were submitted by the focus groups for consideration by all conference participants. Over 80% of the recommendations were deemed to be high impact/high feasibility.; CONCLUSION: A process for acting on recommendations of the ASHP PPMI to advance the practice of health-system pharmacy within the state of Michigan was developed.

AB BACKGROUND: Rapidly evolving advances in the understanding of theorized unique driver mutations within individual patient's cancers, as well as dramatic reduction in the cost of genomic profiling, have stimulated major interest in the role of such testing in routine clinical practice. The aim of this study was to report our initial experience with genomic testing in heavily pretreated breast cancer patients.; METHODS: Patients with primary or recurrent breast cancer managed at any of our five hospitals and whose malignancy had failed to respond to therapy or had progressed on all recognized standard-of-care options were offered the opportunity to have their cancer undergo next-generation sequencing genomic profiling.; RESULTS: Of a total of 101 patients, 98 (97 %) had at least one specific genomic alteration identified. A total of 465 different somatic genetic abnormalities were revealed in this group of patients. Although 52 % of patients were found to have an abnormality for which an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug was available, 69 % of patients had an FDA-approved agent for an indication other than breast cancer. The most common genomic alterations of potential clinical consequence were PIK3 (25 %), FGFR1 (16 %), AKT (11 %), PTEN (10 %), ERBB2 (8 %), JAK2 (6 %), and RAF1 (5 %).; CONCLUSIONS: Almost all advanced breast cancers possess at least one well-characterized genomic alteration that might be actionable at the clinical level. Further, in most cases, a plausible argument can be advanced for the potential biological and clinical relevance of an FDA-approved antineoplastic agent not currently indicated in the treatment of breast cancer.

AB INTRODUCTION: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15 - 20% of all lung cancer cases with few advances made in the systemic treatment and outcomes for extensive-stage SCLC. Many strategies have been evaluated over the past 15 years but none of these approaches has resulted in improved survival rates for patients with SCLC. The IGF receptor (IGF-R) pathway represents a potential actionable target in SCLC patients. Indeed, the IGF-R pathway is involved in cancer development and progression and regulates different vital processes including fetal development, growth and metabolism.; AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of insulin inhibitors and the strategies undertaken in recent years with SCLC. Specifically, the article discusses ganitumab and its applicability to SCLC patients.; EXPERT OPINION: At present, there is a lack of therapeutic choices for patients with advanced SCLC. Unfortunately, ganitumab, administered in combination with chemotherapy, demonstrated no clinical activity in patients with SCLC, although it could have utility with other cancers. Furthermore, insulin inhibitors may have some utility in the treatment of SCLC and further studies are required to identify subsets of patients most likely to benefit from their use. The authors also believe that it is important to determine the exact role of the IGF pathway in the pathogenesis and propagation of SCLC.

AB Unprecedented progress in sequencing technologies and decreasing cost have brought genomic testing into the clinical setting. At the same time, the debate in the literature concerning the return of incidental findings (IFs) has made this an important issue internationally. These developments reflect a shift in genetics that will also affect smaller countries, such as Greece, that are just starting to implement these technologies and may look to other countries for examples of good practice. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted with Greek experts in clinical sequencing. Previous experiences and attitudes toward IFs and clinical sequencing were investigated as well as views on the existing policy regarding managing genetic information generated through testing.. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. All participants reported the lack of any legal or other supportive mechanism. IFs are currently managed at a "local" level, i.e. within the clinic or the laboratory in an ad hoc way. All participants thought that clinically valid and actionable IFs should be returned, but always with caution and in respect to patients' wishes, although several experts reported returning IFs according to their clinical discretion. Experts reported that most patients ask for all tests available but they felt that more counselling is needed to understand and manage genetic information. Due to the lack of any supporting mechanisms, professionals in Greece, even those with established experience in the field of genetic and genomic testing, have difficulties dealing with IFs. All experts agreed that it is now time, before the full integration of genomic testing into everyday clinical practice, for guidance to help Greek physicians work with patients and their families when IFs are discovered.

AB BACKGROUND: Oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (TSCC) are a unique subset of head and neck cancers with a distinct demographic profile, where up to half of the cases are never smokers. A small proportion of patients with OSCC are known to respond to EGFR TKI. We used a high-sensitivity mass spectrometry-based mutation profiling platform to determine the EGFR mutation status, as well as other actionable alterations in a series of Asian TSCC.; METHODS: 66 TSCC patients treated between 1998-2009 with complete clinico-pathologic data were included in this study. Somatic mutation profiling was performed using Sequenom LungCarta v1.0, and correlated with clinical parameters.; RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 20/66(30.3%) of samples and involved TP53, STK11, MET, PIK3CA, BRAF and NRF2. No activating EGFR mutations or KRAS mutations were discovered in our series, where just over a third were never smokers. The most common mutations were in p53 (10.6%; n=7) and MET (10.6%, n=11) followed by STK11 (9.1%, n=6) and PIK3CA (4.5%, n=3). BRAF and NRF2 mutations, which are novel in TSCC, were demonstrated in one sample each. There was no significant correlation between overall mutation status and smoking history (p=0.967) or age (p=0.360). Positive MET alteration was associated with poorer loco-regional recurrence free survival (LRFS) of 11months [vs 90months in MET-negative group (p=0.008)]. None of the other mutations were significantly correlated with LRFS or overall survival. Four of these tumors were propagated as immortalized cell lines and demonstrated the same mutations as the original tumor.; CONCLUSIONS: Using the Sequenom multiplexed LungCarta panel, we identified mutations in 6 genes, TP53, STK11, MET, PIK3CA, BRAF and NRF2, with the notable absence of EGFR and HER2 mutations in our series of Asian OSCC. Primary cell line models recapitulated the mutation profiles of the original primary tumours and provide an invaluable resource for experimental cancer therapeutics.

AB Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy in which significant advances have been observed during the last 15 years. Our understanding of the disease has been advanced through its molecular characterization. We have also seen improvements in patient care with the development of 2 new classes of active agents, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), resulting in a significant improvement in overall survival of myeloma patients such that it can now be debated as to whether some subsets of myeloma patients can be cured. However, the advances in our understanding of myeloma biology occurred in parallel with advances in treatment as opposed to being directly informed by the research. Moreover, the molecular characterization of malignant plasma cells would not have predicted the effectiveness of these novel therapies.We hypothesize that proteasome inhibitors and IMiDs are highly active because malignant plasma cells are constrained by many of the characteristics of their normal counterparts and these novel therapies target both normal plasma cell biology and the cancer biology of myeloma. Thus, a better understanding of normal plasma cell biology will likely yield as many actionable targets as mapping the genomic landscape of this disease.

AB For many domains of basic and applied science, a key set of scientific facts is well established and there is a need for public action in light of those facts. However, individual citizens do not consistently follow science-based recommendations, even when they accept the veracity of the advice. To address this challenge, science communicators need to develop a guideline that individuals can commit to memory easily and act on straightforwardly at moments of decision. We draw on research from psychology to discuss several characteristics that will enhance a guideline's memorability and actionability and illustrate using a case study from the US Department of Agriculture's communications based on nutrition science. We conclude by discussing the importance of careful research to test whether any given guideline is memorable and actionable by the intended target audience.

AB Large-scale, genomic studies of specific tumors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas have provided a better understanding of the alterations of pathways involved in the development of solid tumors including glioblastoma, breast cancer, ovarian and endometrial cancers, colon cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma. This tremendous effort of the scientific community has confirmed the view that cancer actually represents a wide variety of diseases originating from different organs. These studies showed that TP53 and PI3KCA are the two most mutated genes in all types of cancers and that 30-70% of all solid tumors harbor potentially 'actionable' mutations that can be exploited for patient stratification or treatment optimization. Translation of this huge oncogenomic data set to clinical application in personalized medicine programs is now the main challenge for the future. The gap between our basic knowledge and clinical application is still wide. Closing the gap will require translational personalized trials, which may initiate a radical change in our routine clinical practice in oncology.  © The Author 2014.

AB Cancer treatment decisions rely on genetics, large data screens and clinical pharmacology. Here we point out that genetic analysis and treatment decisions may overlook critical elements in cancer development, progression and drug resistance. Two critical structural elements are missing in genetics-based decision-making: the mechanisms of oncogenic mutations and the cellular network which is rewired in cancer. These lay the foundation for the structural basis for cancer treatment decisions, which is rooted in the physical principles of the molecular conformational behavior of single molecules and their interactions. Improved tumor mutational analysis platforms and knowledge of the redundant pathways which can take over in cancer, may not only supplement known actionable findings, but forecast possible cancer progression and resistance. Such forward-looking can be powerful, endowing the oncologist with mechanistic insight and cancer prognosis, and consequently more informed treatment options. Examples include redundant pathways taking over after inhibition of EGFR constitutive activation, mutations in PIK3CA p110alpha and p85, and the non-hotspot AKT1 mutants conferring constitutive membrane localization.

AB Following the fanfare of initial, often dramatic, success with small molecule inhibitors in the treatment of defined genomic subgroups, it can be argued that the extension of targeted therapeutics to the majority of patients with solid cancers has stalled. Despite encouraging FDA approval rates, the attrition rates of these compounds remains high in early stage clinical studies, with single agent studies repeatedly showing poor efficacy In striking contrast, our understanding of the complexity of solid neoplasms has increased in huge increments, following the publication of large-scale genomic and transcriptomic datasets from large collaborations such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC http://www.icgc.org/) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). However, there remains a clear disconnect between these rich datasets describing the genomic complexity of cancer, including both intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity, and what a treating oncologist can consider to be a clinically "actionable" mutation profile. Our understanding of these data is in its infancy and we still find difficulties ascribing characteristics to tumours that consistently predict therapeutic response for the majority of small molecule inhibitors. This article will seek to explore the recent studies of the patterns and impact of mutations in drug resistance, and demonstrate how we may use this data to reshape our thinking about biological pathways, critical dependencies and their therapeutic interruption.

AB The Triple Aim of better health, better care, and lower costs has become a fundamental framework for understanding the need for broad health care reform and describing health care value. While the framework is not specific to any clinical setting, this article focuses on the alignment between the framework and Emergency Department (ED) care. The paper explores where emergency care is naturally aligned with each Aim, as well as current barriers which must be addressed to meet the full vision of the Triple Aim. We propose a vision of EDs serving as a nexus for care coordination optimally consistent with the Triple Aim and the requirements for such a role. These requirements include: (1) substantial integration in coordinated care models; (2) development of reliable and actionable data on ED quality, population health, and cost outcomes; (3) specific initiatives to control and optimize ED utilization; and (4) payment models which preserve surge and disaster response capacity.

AB A major challenge in monitoring universal health coverage (UHC) is identifying an indicator that can adequately capture the multiple components underlying the UHC initiative. Effective coverage, which unites individual and intervention characteristics into a single metric, offers a direct and flexible means to measure health system performance at different levels. We view effective coverage as a relevant and actionable metric for tracking progress towards achieving UHC. In this paper, we review the concept of effective coverage and delineate the three components of the metric - need, use, and quality - using several examples. Further, we explain how the metric can be used for monitoring interventions at both local and global levels. We also discuss the ways that current health information systems can support generating estimates of effective coverage. We conclude by recognizing some of the challenges associated with producing estimates of effective coverage. Despite these challenges, effective coverage is a powerful metric that can provide a more nuanced understanding of whether, and how well, a health system is delivering services to its populations.

AB AIMS: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) carries a poor prognosis, and the systemic therapies currently used as treatments are only modestly effective, as demonstrated by a low 5-year survival at only 5%. In this retrospective collected from March 2013 to study, we performed comprehensive genomic profiling of 98 small cell undifferentiated lung cancer (SCLC) samples to identify potential targets of therapy not currently searched for in routine clinical practice.; METHODS: DNA from 98 SCLC was sequenced to high, uniform coverage (Illumina HiSeq 2500) and analysed for all classes of genomic alterations.; RESULTS: A total of 386 alterations were identified for an average of 3.9 alterations per tumour (range 1-10). Fifty-two (53%) of cases harboured at least 1 actionable alteration with the potential to personalise therapy including base substitutions, amplifications or homozygous deletions in RICTOR (10%), KIT (7%), PIK3CA (6%), EGFR (5%), PTEN (5%), KRAS (5%), MCL1 (4%), FGFR1 (4%), BRCA2, (4%), TSC1 (3%), NF1 (3%), EPHA3 (3%) and CCND1. The most common non-actionable genomic alterations were alterations in TP53 (86% of SCLC cases), RB1 (54%) and MLL2 (17%).; CONCLUSIONS: Greater than 50% of the SCLC cases harboured at least one actionable alteration. Given the limited treatment options and poor prognosis of patients with SCLC, comprehensive genomic profiling has the potential to identify new treatment paradigms and meet an unmet clinical need for this disease.

AB Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with adenocarcinoma being the most common histological subtype. Deeper understanding of the pathobiology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has led to the development of small molecules that target genetic mutations known to play critical roles in progression to metastatic disease and to influence response to targeted therapies. The principle goal of precision medicine is to define those patient populations most likely to respond to targeted therapies. However, the cancer genome landscape is composed of relatively few "mountains" [representing the most commonly mutated genes like KRAS, epidermal growth factor (EGFR), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)] and a vast number of "hills" (representing low frequency but potentially actionable mutations). Low-frequency lesions that affect a druggable gene product allow a relatively small population of cancer patients for targeted therapy to be selected.

AB To identify previously reported disease mutations that are compatible with extraordinary longevity, we screened the coding regions of the genomes of 44 Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians. Individual genome sequences were generated with 30* coverage on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and single-nucleotide variants were called with the genome analysis toolkit (GATK). We identified 130 coding variants that were annotated as "pathogenic" or "likely pathogenic" based on the ClinVar database and that are infrequent in the general population. These variants were previously reported to cause a wide range of degenerative, neoplastic, and cardiac diseases with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance. Several of these variants are located in genes that harbor actionable incidental findings, according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics. In addition, we found risk variants for late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as the APOE epsilon4 allele that was even present in a homozygous state in one centenarian who did not develop Alzheimer's disease. Our data demonstrate that the incidental finding of certain reported disease variants in an individual genome may not preclude an extraordinarily long life. When the observed variants are encountered in the context of clinical sequencing, it is thus important to exercise caution in justifying clinical decisions.

AB Prostate cancer is among the most prevalent life-threatening cancers diagnosed in the male population today. Various methods have been exploited in an attempt to treat this disease but these treatments, alongside preventative tactics, have been insufficient to control mortality rates and have usually resulted in detrimental adverse events. An opportunity to devise more-specific and potentially more-effective approaches for the eradication of prostate tumours can be found by targeting specific biological pathways. NUMB (protein numb homologue), a key regulator of cell fate, represents an attractive, actionable target in prostate cancer. NUMB participates in the observed deregulation of NOTCH (neurogenic locus notch homologue protein) signalling in prostate tumours, and the NUMB-NOTCH interaction regulates cell fate. NUMB has potential both as a target for control of prostate tumorigenesis and as a biomarker for identification of patients with prostate cancer who are likely to benefit from NOTCH inhibition.

AB OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology "Consensus conference on obesity: building an evidence base for comprehensive action" convened March 23-25, 2014, in Washington, D.C. The premise of the conference was that by bringing together stakeholders in U.S. obesity care, representing the biomedical and public health models, new information would emerge to formulate actionable recommendations.; RESULTS: Key conference findings include 5 affirmed and 8 emergent concepts. These concepts include the need for a medically meaningful and actionable diagnosis of obesity, research that evaluates and refines a complications-centric clinical approach to obesity, the need for a better understanding of reimbursement mechanisms and the value associated with obesity prevention and management, increased nutrition and obesity education, and enhanced public awareness and health literacy.; CONCLUSION: Next steps include deriving a more robust medical definition of obesity, translation of the affirmed and emergent concepts into actionable recommendations in the interests of patients with obesity, and developing logistics for effective implementation.

AB With over 16 million tweets per hour, 600 new blog posts per minute, and 400 million active users on Facebook, businesses have begun searching for ways to turn real-time consumer-based posts into actionable intelligence. The goal is to extract information from this noisy, unstructured data and use it for trend analysis and prediction. Current practices support the idea that visual analytics (VA) can help enable the effective analysis of such data. However, empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of a VA solution is still lacking. A proposed VA toolkit extracts data from Bitly and Twitter to predict movie revenue and ratings. Results from the 2013 VAST Box Office Challenge demonstrate the benefit of an interactive environment for predictive analysis, compared to a purely statistical modeling approach. The VA approach used by the toolkit is generalizable to other domains involving social media data, such as sales forecasting and advertisement analysis.

AB PURPOSE: This study tested the combination of an episode payment coupled with actionable use and quality data as an incentive to improve quality and reduce costs.; METHODS: Medical oncologists were paid a single fee, in lieu of any drug margin, to treat their patients. Chemotherapy medications were reimbursed at the average sales price, a proxy for actual cost.; RESULTS: Five volunteer medical groups were compared with a large national payer registry of fee-for-service patients with cancer to examine the difference in cost before and after the initiation of the payment change. Between October 2009 and December 2012, the five groups treated 810 patients with breast, colon, and lung cancer using the episode payments. The registry-predicted fee-for-service cost of the episodes cohort was $98,121,388, but the actual cost was $64,760,116. The predicted cost of chemotherapy drugs was $7,519,504, but the actual cost was $20,979,417. There was no difference between the groups on multiple quality measures.; CONCLUSION: Modifying the current fee-for-service payment system for cancer therapy with feedback data and financial incentives that reward outcomes and cost efficiency resulted in a significant total cost reduction. Eliminating existing financial chemotherapy drug incentives paradoxically increased the use of chemotherapy. Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: Actionable Nuggets for spinal cord injury (SCI) are a knowledge translation tool facilitating evidence-based primary care practice, originally developed in 2010 and refined in 2013. Evaluation results from these two phases of development have informed the design of SkillScribe, an innovative electronic platform intended to offer reflective continuing medical education (CME) programming through mobile devices in order to support the key features of the Actionable Nuggets approach. This brief article describes the ongoing development of Actionable Nuggets for SCI on SkillScribe by: (1) summarizing the work to date on Actionable Nuggets; (2) describing evaluation results of Actionable Nuggets; (3) placing SkillScribe in the context of adult education.; DESIGN: Developmental Research Design.; SETTING: Canadian primary care.; PARTICIPANTS: Primary care physicians; specialist physicians.; INTERVENTIONS: Twenty educational modules on SCI.; OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and post-test knowledge survey, feedback and use statistics, impact assessment survey, qualitative analysis of evaluation data.; RESULTS: In both hard copy and electronic form, physicians report that Actionable Nuggets are an acceptable and useful approach to providing CME for low-prevalence, high-impact conditions like SCI. The key elements of this tool are that they: offer evidence-based information in small, focused "nuggets"; position information where physicians most frequently seek it; offer information in a format that permits direct translation into action in primary care; allow time for reflection; attach practice tools; and offer CME credit.; CONCLUSION: Actionable Nuggets for SCI, delivered using a convenient and portable electronic medium, with time-released content and interactive testing has the potential to improve the primary care of patients with SCI.

AB IMPORTANCE: Screening adolescents for substance use and intervening immediately can reduce the burden of addiction and substance-related morbidity. Several screening tools have been developed to identify problem substance use for adolescents, but none have been calibrated to triage adolescents into clinically relevant risk categories to guide interventions.; OBJECTIVE: To describe the psychometric properties of an electronic screen and brief assessment tool that triages adolescents into 4 actionable categories regarding their experience with nontobacco substance use.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent patients (age range, 12-17 years) arriving for routine medical care at 2 outpatient primary care centers and 1 outpatient center for substance use treatment at a pediatric hospital completed an electronic screening tool from June 1, 2012, through March 31, 2013, that consisted of a question on the frequency of using 8 types of drugs in the past year (Screening to Brief Intervention). Additional questions assessed severity of any past-year substance use. Patients completed a structured diagnostic interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module), yielding Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) substance use diagnoses.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the entire screen and the Screening to Brief Intervention, sensitivity and specificity for identifying nontobacco substance use, substance use disorders, severe substance use disorders, and tobacco dependence were calculated using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module as the criterion standard.; RESULTS: Of 340 patients invited to participate, 216 (63.5%) enrolled in the study. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 84% (95% CI, 76%-89%) for identifying nontobacco substance use, 90% (95% CI, 77%-96%) and 94% (95% CI, 89%-96%) for substance use disorders, 100% and 94% (95% CI, 90%-96%) for severe substance use disorders, and 75% (95% CI, 52%-89%) and 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for nicotine dependence. No significant differences were found in sensitivity or specificity between the full tool and the Screening to Brief Intervention.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A single screening question assessing past-year frequency use for 8 commonly misused categories of substances appears to be a valid method for discriminating among clinically relevant risk categories of adolescent substance use.

AB PURPOSE: Existing recommendations for communicating with patients with metastatic cancer about redefining goals of care when anticancer treatment is unlikely to provide benefit are based on limited evidence. This study was designed to elicit patient and family views on commonly used communication practices.; STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 37 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancer and 20 bereaved family members who listened to audiorecordings of oncology fellows instructed to discuss a transition in goals of care with a standardized patient for whom evidence-based palliative chemotherapy was no longer effective. During semistructured qualitative interviews, participants commented on the audiorecordings to give feedback on what they liked or disliked about the oncologist's communication. These comments were transcribed and analyzed.; RESULTS: Three preferred communication practices were identified from participants' comments. The first practice involves a necessary disruption of the patient's expectations about "trying another chemo" ("We're in a different place"). The second practice is offering actionable responses to the disruption ("Here's what we can do now"). The third practice is to find a new place that acknowledges death is closer yet still allows for "living forward" ("Use your inner wisdom").; CONCLUSION: This study of patient and family feedback indicates that patients and families perceive a conversation about goals of care to require disruption of an existing routine, followed by a process of searching and then reconfiguration, rather than a logical decision process. These findings suggest that assessing quality from patient perspectives must take into account a period of disruption and chaos.

AB BACKGROUND: The natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) suggests that some remain slow in growth rate whereas many develop a more accelerated growth rate and reach a threshold for intervention. We hypothesized that different mechanisms are responsible for AAAs that remain slow growing and never become actionable vs the aggressive AAAs that require intervention and may be reflected by distinct associations with genetic polymorphisms.; METHODS: AAA growth rate was determined from serial imaging data in 168 control and 141 AAA patients with ultrasound or computed tomography imaging studies covering 5 years. Genetic polymorphisms all previously reported as showing a significant correlation with AAA with functional effects on the expression or function were determined by analysis of the genomic DNA, including angiotensin 1 receptor (rs5186), interleukin-10 (IL-10; rs1800896), methyl-tetrahydrofolate reductase (rs1801133), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1; rs1466535), angiotensin-converting enzyme (rs1799752), and several matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) single nucleotide polymorphisms.; RESULTS: Of the AAA patients, 81 were classified as slow AAA growth rate (<3.25 mm/y) vs 60 with aggressive AAA growth rate (>3.25 mm/y, those presenting with a rupture, or those with maximal aortic diameter >5.5 cm [male] or >5.0 cm [female]). Discriminating confounds between the groups were identified by logistic regression. Analyses identified MMP-9 p-2502 single nucleotide polymorphism (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.94; P = .029) as a significant confound discriminating between control vs slow-growth AAA, MMP-9 D165N (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.95; P = .035) and LRP1 (OR, 4.99; 95% CI, 1.13-22.1; P = .034) between control vs aggressive-growth AAAs, and methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.01-8.86; P = .048), MMP-9 p-2502 (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.05-4.58; P = .037), and LRP1 (OR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.03-23.9; P = .046) as the statistically significant confounds distinguishing slow-growth AAAs vs aggressive-growth AAAs.; CONCLUSIONS: Logistic regression identified different genetic confounds for the slow-growth and aggressive-growth AAAs, indicating a potential for different genetic influences on AAAs of distinct aggressiveness. Future logistic regression studies investigating for potential genetic or clinical confounds for this disease should take into account the growth rate and size of the AAA to better identify confounds likely to be associated with aggressive AAAs likely to require intervention.

AB PURPOSE: Tumor somatic mutation analysis is part of the standard management of metastatic lung cancer. However, physicians often have to deal with small biopsies and consequently with challenging mutation testing. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising tool for accessing the tumor genome as a liquid biopsy. Here, we evaluated next-generation sequencing (NGS) on cfDNA samples obtained from a consecutive series of patients for the screening of a range of clinically relevant mutations.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 107 plasma samples were collected from the BioCAST/IFCT-1002 lung cancer study (never-smokers cohort). Matched tumor DNA (tDNA) was obtained for 68 cases. Multiplex PCR-based assays were designed to target specific coding regions in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, and PI3KCA genes, and amplicon sequencing was performed at deep coverage on the cfDNA/tDNA pairs using the NGS IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine Platform.; RESULTS: CfDNA concentration in plasma was significantly associated with both stage and number of metastatic sites. In tDNA, 50 mutations (36 EGFR, 5 ERBB2, 4 KRAS, 3 BRAF, and 2 PIK3CA) were identified, of which 26 were detected in cfDNA. Sensitivity of the test was 58% (95% confidence interval, 43%-71%) and the estimated specificity was 87% (62%-96%).; CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the feasibility and potential utility of mutation screening in cfDNA using IonTorrent NGS for the detection of a range of tumor biomarkers in patients with metastatic lung cancer. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Circulating Tumor cells (CTCs) represent tumor cells in the blood stream dislodged from the primary tumor. The presence of CTCs in the bloodstream provides a unique opportunity to sample cancer tissue by means of a relatively less-invasive "liquid biopsy." Over the past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of research examining the potential clinical utility of CTCs in the management of cancer. A number of techniques to refine the sensitivity and range of CTC assays are also in development. In this article, we review the recent developments in the current and potential clinical applications of CTCs in breast cancer. CTC enumeration already has an established role as a prognostic biomarker in metastatic breast cancer, while molecular characterization of CTCs can serve as a potential predictive biomarker for therapy selection, pharmacodynamic evaluation, and identification of novel actionable targets for novel therapies. The role of CTCs in breast cancer screening and detection of recurrence is currently limited. Further development in techniques will be pivotal in enhancing the broad applicability of CTCs and advancing the field of personalized breast cancer therapy.

AB Designed experiments provide product developers feedback on the relationship between formulation and consumer acceptability. While actionable, this approach typically assumes a simple psychophysical relationship between ingredient concentration and perceived intensity. This assumption may not be valid, especially in cases where perceptual interactions occur. Additional information can be gained by considering the liking-intensity function, as single ingredients can influence more than one perceptual attribute. Here, 20 coffee-flavored dairy beverages were formulated using a fractional mixture design that varied the amount of coffee extract, fluid milk, sucrose, and water. Overall liking (liking) was assessed by 388 consumers using an incomplete block design (4 out of 20 prototypes) to limit fatigue; all participants also rated the samples for intensity of coffee flavor (coffee), milk flavor (milk), sweetness (sweetness) and thickness (thickness). Across product means, the concentration variables explained 52% of the variance in liking in main effects multiple regression. The amount of sucrose (beta = 0.46) and milk (beta = 0.46) contributed significantly to the model (p's <0.02) while coffee extract (beta = -0.17; p = 0.35) did not. A comparable model based on the perceived intensity explained 63% of the variance in mean liking; sweetness (beta = 0.53) and milk (beta = 0.69) contributed significantly to the model (p's <0.04), while the influence of coffee flavor (beta = 0.48) was positive but marginally (p = 0.09). Since a strong linear relationship existed between coffee extract concentration and coffee flavor, this discrepancy between the two models was unexpected, and probably indicates that adding more coffee extract also adds a negative attribute, e.g. too much bitterness. In summary, modeling liking as a function of both perceived intensity and physical concentration provides a richer interpretation of consumer data.

AB Chronic, complex diseases represent the majority of healthcare utilization and spending in the USA today. Despite this, therapeutics that account for the heterogeneity of these diseases are lacking, begging for more personalized approaches. Improving our understanding of disease phenotypes through retrospective trials of electronic health record data will enable us to better categorize patients. Increased usage of next-generation sequencing will further our understanding of the genetic variants involved in chronic disease. Utilization of data warehousing will be necessary in order to securely handle, integrate and analyze the large sets of data produced with these methods. Finally, increased use of clinical decision support will enable the return of clinically actionable results that physicians can use to apply these personalized approaches.

AB Children with unexplained developmental disabilities or congenital anomalies are increasingly being referred for genetic diagnostic testing using array-comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Their parents will have to deal with the secondary variants that will inevitably arise. We conducted 16 prospective semi-structured interviews with native Dutch-speaking parents whose children had undergone clinical array-CGH testing. The interviews explored the parents' experiences, expectations and opinions, specifically regarding the communication of results. Concrete examples of 'unexpected results' were provided to help guide the discussion, differing in severity, treatability, time of onset, level of risk, and carrier status. Data was analysed using content and narrative analysis methodologies. Parental motivations for and against the disclosure of unexpected results cluster around four main themes: actionability; knowledge; context; and characteristics of the result. Most parents wished to know all types of results. Disclosure was framed within a holistic, contextual, family-wide view. Genetic counselling should aim to integrate explorations of the motivations of parents surrounding the disclosure of results with good clinical care.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable and valid instrument to assess the understandability and actionability of print and audiovisual materials.; METHODS: We compiled items from existing instruments/guides that the expert panel assessed for face/content validity. We completed four rounds of reliability testing, and produced evidence of construct validity with consumers and readability assessments.; RESULTS: The experts deemed the PEMAT items face/content valid. Four rounds of reliability testing and refinement were conducted using raters untrained on the PEMAT. Agreement improved across rounds. The final PEMAT showed moderate agreement per Kappa (Average K=0.57) and strong agreement per Gwet's AC1 (Average=0.74). Internal consistency was strong (alpha=0.71; Average Item-Total Correlation=0.62). For construct validation with consumers (n=47), we found significant differences between actionable and poorly-actionable materials in comprehension scores (76% vs. 63%, p<0.05) and ratings (8.9 vs. 7.7, p<0.05). For understandability, there was a significant difference for only one of two topics on consumer numeric scores. For actionability, there were significant positive correlations between PEMAT scores and consumer-testing results, but no relationship for understandability. There were, however, strong, negative correlations between grade-level and both consumer-testing results and PEMAT scores.; CONCLUSIONS: The PEMAT demonstrated strong internal consistency, reliability, and evidence of construct validity.; PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The PEMAT can help professionals judge the quality of materials (available at: http://www.ahrq.gov/pemat).

AB Exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing (ES/WGS) present individuals with the opportunity to benefit from a broad scope of genetic results of clinical and personal utility. Yet, it is unclear which genetic results people want to receive (i.e., what type of genetic information they want to learn about themselves) or conversely not receive, and how they want to receive or manage results over time. Very little is known about whether and how attitudes toward receiving individual results from ES/WGS vary among racial/ethnic populations. We conducted 13 focus groups with a racially and ethnically diverse parent population (n = 76) to investigate attitudes toward return of individual results from WGS. We report on our findings for non-African American (non-AA) participants. Non-AA participants were primarily interested in genetic results on which they could act or "do something about." They defined "actionability" broadly to include individual medical treatment and disease prevention. The ability to plan for the future was both a motivation for and an expected benefit of receiving results. Their concerns focused on the meaning of results, specifically the potential inaccuracy and uncertainty of results. Non-AA participants expected healthcare providers to be involved in results management by helping them interpret results in the context of their own health and by providing counseling support. We compare and contrast these themes with those we previously reported from our analysis of African American (AA) perspectives to highlight the importance of varying preferences for results, characterize the central role of temporal orientation in framing expectations about the possibility of receiving ES/WGS results, and identify potential avenues by which genomic healthcare disparities may be inadvertently perpetuated. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in transforming the lives of HIV-infected individuals with access to these drugs is tempered by the increasing threat of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) to their overall health and quality of life. Intensive investigations over the past two decades have underscored the role of host immune responses, inflammation, and monocyte-derived macrophages in HAND, but the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying HAND remain only partially delineated. Complicating research efforts and therapeutic drug development are the sheer complexity of HAND phenotypes, diagnostic imprecision, and the growing intersection of chronic immune activation with aging-related comorbidities. Yet, genetic studies still offer a powerful means of advancing individualized care for HIV-infected individuals at risk. There is an urgent need for 1) longitudinal studies using consistent phenotypic definitions of HAND in HIV-infected subpopulations at very high risk of being adversely impacted, such as children, 2) tissue studies that correlate neuropathological changes in multiple brain regions with genomic markers in affected individuals and with changes at the RNA, epigenomic, and/or protein levels, and 3) genetic association studies using more sensitive subphenotypes of HAND. The NIH Brain Initiative and Human Connectome Project, coupled with rapidly evolving systems biology and machine learning approaches for analyzing high-throughput genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, hold promise for identifying actionable biological processes and gene networks that underlie HAND. This review summarizes the current state of understanding of host genetic factors predisposing to HAND in light of past challenges and suggests some priorities for future research to advance the understanding and clinical management of HAND in the cART era.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current NCCN guidelines recommend epirubicin (E), cisplatin (C), and 5-fluorouracil (F) as a first-line therapeutic approach for operable gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). Molecular profiling (MP) was used to evaluate the expression of chemotherapy targeted biomarkers associated with ECF therapy and other first-line cytotoxic regimens for GC.; METHODS: GC specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TOP2A, TS, ERCC1, PGP, and TOPO1 expression (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ) from 2009 to 2012.; RESULTS: A total of 230 GC specimens were analyzed. The median age of patients was 61 (IQR: 50-72) years with the majority being male (n = 139, 60%). IHC actionable targets included: 60% (n = 138) high TOP2A, 55% (n = 127) negative ERCC1, and 63% (n = 145) negative TS, indicating potential benefit from E, C, and F, respectively. Simultaneous expression analysis demonstrated only 24% (n = 55) of patients had gene expression levels that suggested uniform sensitivity to ECF. Biomarker results of 6.5% (n = 15) of patients revealed a potential complete lack of sensitivity to first-line ECF.; CONCLUSIONS: MP of GC has the potential to define patients who would derive the greatest benefit from current therapies. Prospective controlled studies are required to validate the role of biomarkers in the management of GC patients. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Metastatic bladder cancer is a lethal disease. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy, including the combination regimens gemcitabine-cisplatin and methotrexate-vinblastine-doxorubicin-cisplatin, are the standard first-line therapies. Second-line therapies have modest activity and no significant improvement in patient outcomes. Agents targeting growth, survival, and proliferation pathways have been added to cytotoxic therapy with limited added benefit to date. Modulating host immune response to cancer-associated antigens appears promising, with multiple new therapeutic approaches being pursued. Next-generation sequencing of invasive urothelial carcinoma has provided insights into the biology of this disease and potential actionable targets. Alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway represent potential therapeutic targets in advanced disease, and novel agents are in development. Recent data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network bladder cancer cohort and other efforts suggest that mutations in chromatin-regulatory genes are very common in invasive bladder tumors, and are more frequent than in other studied tumors. The discovery of new genomic alterations challenges drug development to change the course of this disease.

AB BACKGROUND: The US Army suicide rate has increased sharply in recent years. Identifying significant predictors of Army suicides in Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative records might help focus prevention efforts and guide intervention content. Previous studies of administrative data, although documenting significant predictors, were based on limited samples and models. A career history perspective is used here to develop more textured models.; METHOD: The analysis was carried out as part of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS). De-identified data were combined across numerous Army and DoD administrative data systems for all Regular Army soldiers on active duty in 2004-2009. Multivariate associations of sociodemographics and Army career variables with suicide were examined in subgroups defined by time in service, rank and deployment history.; RESULTS: Several novel results were found that could have intervention implications. The most notable of these were significantly elevated suicide rates (69.6-80.0 suicides per 100000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100000 person-years in the total Army) among enlisted soldiers deployed either during their first year of service or with less than expected (based on time in service) junior enlisted rank; a substantially greater rise in suicide among women than men during deployment; and a protective effect of marriage against suicide only during deployment.; CONCLUSIONS: A career history approach produces several actionable insights missed in less textured analyses of administrative data predictors. Expansion of analyses to a richer set of predictors might help refine understanding of intervention implications.

AB Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease, with a burden of genomic alterations exceeding most other tumors. The goal of our study was to evaluate the frequencies of co-occurring mutations and copy-number aberrations (CNAs) within the same tumor and to evaluate their potential clinical impact. Mass-spectrometry based mutation profiling using a customized lung cancer panel evaluating 214 mutations across 26 key NSCLC genes was performed on 230 nonsquamous NSCLC and integrated with genome-wide CNAs and clinical variables. Among the 138 cases having at least one mutation, one-third (41, 29.7%) showed two or more mutations, either in the same gene (double mutation) or in different genes (co-mutations). In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant cancers, there was a double mutation in 18% and co-mutations in the following genes: TP53 (10%), PIK3CA (8%), STK11 (6%) and MET (4%). Significant relationships were detected between EGFR mutation and 1p, 7p copy gains (harboring the EGFR gene) as well as 13q copy loss. KRAS mutation was significantly related with 1q gain and 3q loss. For Stage I, tumors harboring at least one mutation or PIK3CA mutation were significantly correlated with poor prognosis (p-value=0.02). When combining CNAs and mutational status, patients having both KRAS mutation and the highest related CNA (3q22.3 copy loss) showed a significant poorer prognosis (p-value=0.03). Our study highlights the clinical relevance of studying tumor complexity by integrative genomic analysis and the need for developing assays that broadly screen for both "actionable" mutations and copy-number alterations to improve precision of stratified treatment approaches.  © 2014 UICC.

AB Since first sequencing the human genome in 2003, emerging genetic/genomic technologies have ushered in a revolutionary era of medicine that purports to bridge molecular biology and clinical care. The field of translational medicine is charged with mediating this revolution. Sequencing innovations are far outpacing guidelines intended to ease their practice-based applications, including in primary care. As a result, genomic medicine's full integration in primary care settings especially, has been slow to materialize. Researchers and clinicians alike face substantial challenges in navigating contentious ethical issues raised in translation and implementation, namely preserving the spirit of whole-person approaches to care; maintaining respect for persons and communities; and translating genetic risk into clinical actionability. This commentary therefore explores practical barriers to, and ethical implications of, incorporating genomic technologies in the primary care sector. These ethical challenges are both philosophical and infrastructural. From a primary care perspective, the commentary further reviews the ethical, legal and social implications of the Center for Disease Control's proposed model for assessing the validity and utility of genomic testing and family health history applications. Lastly, the authors provide recommendations for future translational initiatives that aim to maximize the capacities of genomic medicine, without compromising primary care philosophies and foundations of practice.

AB Much research is underway on the links between diet and obesity. So too are long-running disputes among nutritionists on core questions about the relationship. This editorial reviews the state-of-play on four issues: what makes people fat, how to lose weight, how much do we eat, and what policies to adopt towards obesity. The practical consequence is that, at present, frontline health professionals will not find in nutrition science agreed, actionable solutions to assist overweight patients. But research and debate continues actively.

AB BACKGROUND: Predictive biomarker development is a key challenge for novel cancer therapeutics. We explored the feasibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to validate exploratory genomic biomarkers that impact phase I trial selection.; METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 158 patients with advanced solid tumours referred for phase I clinical trials at the Royal Marsden Hospital (October 2012 to March 2013). After fresh and/or archived tumour tissue were obtained, 93 patients remained candidates for phase I trials. Results from tumour sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq were cross-validated in 27 out of 93 patients on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (IT-PGM) blinded to results. MiSeq validation with Sequenom MassARRAY OncoCarta 1.0 (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was performed in a separate cohort.; RESULTS: We found 97% concordance of mutation calls by MiSeq and IT-PGM at a variant allele frequency ⩾13% and ⩾500 * depth coverage, and 91% concordance between MiSeq and Sequenom. Common 'actionable' mutations involved deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair (51%), RAS-RAF-MEK (35%), Wnt (26%), and PI3K-AKT-mTOR (24%) signalling. Out of 53, 29 (55%) patients participating in phase I trials were recommended based on identified actionable mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Targeted high-coverage NGS panels are a highly feasible single-centre technology well-suited to cross-platform validation, enrichment of trials with molecularly defined populations and hypothesis testing early in drug development.

AB BACKGROUND: High-throughput next generation sequencing technologies have enabled rapid characterization of clinical and environmental samples. Consequently, the largest bottleneck to actionable data has become sample processing and bioinformatics analysis, creating a need for accurate and rapid algorithms to process genetic data. Perfectly characterized in silico datasets are a useful tool for evaluating the performance of such algorithms. Background contaminating organisms are observed in sequenced mixtures of organisms. In silico samples provide exact truth. To create the best value for evaluating algorithms, in silico data should mimic actual sequencer data as closely as possible.; RESULTS: FASTQSim is a tool that provides the dual functionality of NGS dataset characterization and metagenomic data generation. FASTQSim is sequencing platform-independent, and computes distributions of read length, quality scores, indel rates, single point mutation rates, indel size, and similar statistics for any sequencing platform. To create training or testing datasets, FASTQSim has the ability to convert target sequences into in silico reads with specific error profiles obtained in the characterization step.; CONCLUSIONS: FASTQSim enables users to assess the quality of NGS datasets. The tool provides information about read length, read quality, repetitive and non-repetitive indel profiles, and single base pair substitutions. FASTQSim allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software. In this regard, in silico datasets generated with the FASTQsim tool hold several advantages over natural datasets: they are sequencing platform independent, extremely well characterized, and less expensive to generate. Such datasets are valuable in a number of applications, including the training of assemblers for multiple platforms, benchmarking bioinformatics algorithm performance, and creating challenge datasets for detecting genetic engineering toolmarks, etc.

AB OBJECTIVES: As technology continues to evolve and rise in various industries, such as healthcare, science, education, and gaming, a sophisticated concept known as Big Data is surfacing. The concept of analytics aims to understand data. We set out to portray and discuss perspectives of the evolving use of Big Data in science and healthcare and, to examine some of the opportunities and challenges.; METHODS: A literature review was conducted to highlight the implications associated with the use of Big Data in scientific research and healthcare innovations, both on a large and small scale.; RESULTS: Scientists and health-care providers may learn from one another when it comes to understanding the value of Big Data and analytics. Small data, derived by patients and consumers, also requires analytics to become actionable. Connectivism provides a framework for the use of Big Data and analytics in the areas of science and healthcare. This theory assists individuals to recognize and synthesize how human connections are driving the increase in data. Despite the volume and velocity of Big Data, it is truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. Concluding Thoughts: The concept of Big Data and associated analytics are to be taken seriously when approaching the use of vast volumes of both structured and unstructured data in science and health-care. Future exploration of issues surrounding data privacy, confidentiality, and education are needed. A greater focus on data from social media, the quantified self-movement, and the application of analytics to "small data" would also be useful.

AB OBJECTIVES: Implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems continues to expand. The massive number of patient encounters results in high amounts of stored data. Transforming clinical data into knowledge to improve patient care has been the goal of biomedical informatics professionals for many decades, and this work is now increasingly recognized outside our field. In reviewing the literature for the past three years, we focus on "big data" in the context of EHR systems and we report on some examples of how secondary use of data has been put into practice.; METHODS: We searched PubMed database for articles from January 1, 2011 to November 1, 2013. We initiated the search with keywords related to "big data" and EHR. We identified relevant articles and additional keywords from the retrieved articles were added. Based on the new keywords, more articles were retrieved and we manually narrowed down the set utilizing predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.; RESULTS: Our final review includes articles categorized into the themes of data mining (pharmacovigilance, phenotyping, natural language processing), data application and integration (clinical decision support, personal monitoring, social media), and privacy and security.; CONCLUSION: The increasing adoption of EHR systems worldwide makes it possible to capture large amounts of clinical data. There is an increasing number of articles addressing the theme of "big data", and the concepts associated with these articles vary. The next step is to transform healthcare big data into actionable knowledge.

AB Despite increasing recent emphasis on the social and structural determinants of HIV-related behavior, empirical research and interventions lag behind, partly because of the complexity of social-structural approaches. This article provides a comprehensive and practical review of the diverse literature on multi-level approaches to HIV-related behavior change in the interest of contributing to the ongoing shift to more holistic theory, research, and practice. It has the following specific aims: (1) to provide a comprehensive list of relevant variables/factors related to behavior change at all points on the individual-structural spectrum, (2) to map out and compare the characteristics of important recent multi-level models, (3) to reflect on the challenges of operating with such complex theoretical tools, and (4) to identify next steps and make actionable recommendations. Using a multi-level approach implies incorporating increasing numbers of variables and increasingly context-specific mechanisms, overall producing greater intricacies. We conclude with recommendations on how best to respond to this complexity, which include: using formative research and interdisciplinary collaboration to select the most appropriate levels and variables in a given context; measuring social and institutional variables at the appropriate level to ensure meaningful assessments of multiple levels are made; and conceptualizing intervention and research with reference to theoretical models and mechanisms to facilitate transferability, sustainability, and scalability.

AB Gastric cancer is currently the second leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality. Ongoing collaborative sequencing efforts have highlighted recurrent somatic genomic aberrations in gastric cancer, however, despite advances in characterizing the genomic landscape, there have been few advances in patient outcomes. Prognosis remains poor with a median overall survival of 12 months for advanced disease. The improved survival with trastuzumab, and more recently ramucirumab, underscore the promise of targeted and biologic therapies and the importance of molecular tumor characterization in gastric cancer. Here we review the most frequent actionable alterations in gastric cancer and highlight ongoing clinical investigations attempting to translate biologic understanding into improved clinical outcomes.

AB According to recent reports, the success rate of targeted therapy directed by "actionable mutations" found in tumour DNA is rather low (10 to 20%). Interesting attempts have been made to improve this by establishing mouse "avatars" and testing drugs on them. The first results are promising, but the clinical utility of this expensive and cumbersome approach needs to be ascertained by more extensive testing.  © 2014 medecine/sciences - Inserm.

AB Bringing clinical and financial data together is critical to effectively running and operating service lines. Helping clinicians use cost data to make decisions requires a shared vision and a partnership between finance leaders and physicians. Hosting a "jam session" of technical, financial, and clinical experts can accelerate an organization's business intelligence strategy. Labor and supply costs represent the most actionable cost data for clinicians. Clinician buy-in hinges on education and support. It is important to focus on easy wins at the beginning of the project.

AB BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequencing analysis detects variants of uncertain clinical significance in approximately 2% of patients undergoing clinical diagnostic testing in our laboratory. The reclassification of these variants into either a pathogenic or benign clinical interpretation is critical for improved patient management. We developed a statistical variant reclassification tool based on the premise that probands with disease-causing mutations are expected to have more severe personal and family histories than those having benign variants. The algorithm was validated using simulated variants based on approximately 145,000 probands, as well as 286 BRCA1 and 303 BRCA2 true variants. Positive and negative predictive values of ≥99% were obtained for each gene. Although the history weighting algorithm was not designed to detect alleles of lower penetrance, analysis of the hypomorphic mutations c.5096G>A (p.Arg1699Gln; BRCA1) and c.7878G>C (p.Trp2626Cys; BRCA2) indicated that the history weighting algorithm is able to identify some lower penetrance alleles. The history weighting algorithm is a powerful tool that accurately assigns actionable clinical classifications to variants of uncertain clinical significance. While being developed for reclassification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, the history weighting algorithm is expected to be applicable to other cancer- and non-cancer-related genes.

AB Single-cell sequencing approaches are needed to characterize the genomic diversity of complex tumors, shedding light on their evolutionary paths and potentially suggesting more effective therapies. In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Francis and colleagues develop a novel integrative approach to identify distinct tumor subpopulations based on joint detection of clonal and subclonal events from bulk tumor and single-nucleus whole-genome sequencing, allowing them to infer a subclonal architecture. Surprisingly, the authors identify convergent evolution of multiple, mutually exclusive, independent EGFR gain-of-function variants in a single tumor. This study demonstrates the value of integrative single-cell genomics and highlights the biologic primacy of EGFR as an actionable target in glioblastoma. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB UNLABELLED: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a neoplasm that typically occurs in children. The genetic landscape of this tumor is incompletely understood and therapeutic options are limited. Although 50% of IMTs harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, no therapeutic targets have been identified in ALK-negative tumors. We report for the first time that IMTs harbor other actionable targets, including ROS1 and PDGFRbeta fusions. We detail the case of an 8-year-old boy with treatment-refractory ALK-negative IMT. Molecular tumor profiling revealed a ROS1 fusion, and he had a dramatic response to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. This case prompted assessment of a larger series of IMTs. Next-generation sequencing revealed that 85% of cases evaluated harbored kinase fusions involving ALK, ROS1, or PDGFRbeta. Our study represents the most comprehensive genetic analysis of IMTs to date and also provides a rationale for routine molecular profiling of these tumors to detect therapeutically actionable kinase fusions.; SIGNIFICANCE: Our study describes the most comprehensive genomics-based evaluation of IMT to date. Because there is no "standard-of-care" therapy for IMT, the identification of actionable genomic alterations, in addition to ALK, is expected to redefine management strategies for patients with this disease. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Annually, the sudden death of thousands of young people remains inadequately explained despite medicolegal investigation. Postmortem genetic testing for channelopathies/cardiomyopathies may illuminate a potential cardiac mechanism and establish a more accurate cause and manner of death and provide an actionable genetic marker to test surviving family members who may be at risk for a fatal arrhythmia. Whole exome sequencing allows for simultaneous genetic interrogation of an individual's entire estimated library of approximately 30000 genes. Following an inconclusive autopsy, whole exome sequencing and gene-specific surveillance of all known major cardiac channelopathy/cardiomyopathy genes (90 total) were performed on autopsy blood-derived genomic DNA from a previously healthy 16-year-old adolescent female found deceased in her bedroom. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed a R249Q-MYH7 mutation associated previously with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sudden death, and impaired beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC-beta) actin-translocating and actin-activated ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity. Whole exome sequencing may be an efficient and cost-effective approach to incorporate molecular studies into the conventional postmortem examination.

AB We report the case of a young, never-smoker woman with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and advanced lung adenocarcinoma refractory to multiple lines of conventional chemotherapy and negative for actionable alterations by routine testing. Comprehensive genomic profiling by clinical-grade next generation sequencing was performed on 3320 exons of 184 cancer-related genes and 37 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. The tumor was found to harbor both EGFR L858R and ERBB2 S310F alterations and also tested positive for a known TP53 germline mutation. The presence of the EGFR mutation was further validated by direct sequencing. Based on these results, a dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor, afatinib, was chosen for treatment. The patient achieved a rapid, complete, and durable response to afatinib monotherapy, both clinically and radiographically. The treatment was very well tolerated. This unique case raises practical questions as to the challenges of molecular testing and highlights the potential association of p53 mutations with concurrent EGFR and ERBB2 aberrations. As this case powerfully illustrates, the combination of broad genomic profiling and targeted therapy guided by mutational analysis offers the possibility of precision management of refractory advanced adenocarcinoma in the background of neoplastic syndromes.

AB Regenerative medicine is a rapidly evolving field that faces novel scientific and regulatory challenges. In September 2013, the International Workshop on Regulatory Pathways for Cell Therapies was convened to discuss the nature of these challenges and potential solutions and to highlight opportunities for potential convergence between different regulatory bodies that might assist the field's development. The workshop discussions generated potentially actionable steps in five main areas that could mitigate cell therapy development pathway risk and accelerate moving promising therapies to patients. These included the need for convergence of regulatory guidelines on donor eligibility and suitability of lines for use in clinical trials and subsequent commercialization for cell therapies to move forward on a global basis; the need to challenge and encourage investigators in the regenerative medicine field to share information and provide examples of comparability studies related to master cell banks; the need for convergence of guidelines across regulatory jurisdictions on requirements for tumorigenicity studies, based on particular cell types and on biodistribution studies; the need to increase transparency in sharing clinical trial information more broadly and disseminating results more rapidly; and the need to establish a forum for sharing the experiences of various approaches being developed to expedite regulatory approvals and access for patients to innovative cell and regenerative therapies in the different regulatory jurisdictions and to assess their potential strengths and weaknesses.  ©AlphaMed Press.

AB Molecular selection has led to the successful use of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). For instance, mutations in EGFR and translocations and fusions in ALK render tumor cells sensitive to some TKIs, leading to substantial clinical benefits. Molecular testing such as DNA sequencing or fragment analysis following PCR, and evaluation of copy number and gene positioning by FISH, have been developed and used clinically to identify mutations/fusions. Meanwhile, TKIs to target actionable mutations/fusions in several other oncogenes are being evaluated. High-throughput sequencing can provide therapy-predictive information as well as identify novel targetable genomic alterations. In this article, we report our experience enabling single-gene testing, and our evolution to panel-based next-generation sequencing.

AB Constitutive phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling has been implicated in multiple myeloma (MM) pathophysiology and is regarded as an actionable target for pharmacological intervention. Isoform-specific PI3K inhibition may offer the most focused treatment approach and could result in greater clinical efficacy and reduced side effects. We therefore performed isoform-specific knockdown of PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG to analyse their individual contributions to MM cell survival and downstream signalling. In addition, we tested the effectivity of the novel PI3K isoform-specific inhibitors BYL-719 (PIK3CA), TGX-221 (PIK3CB), CAL-101 (PIK3CD), and CAY10505 (PIK3CG). We found the PIK3CA isoform to be of paramount importance for constitutive Akt activity in MM cells, and - in contrast to inhibition of other class I isoforms - only the blockade of PIK3CA was sufficient to induce cell death in a sizeable subgroup of MM samples. Furthermore, pharmacological PIK3CA inhibition in combination treatments of BYL-719 and established anti-myeloma agents resulted in strongly enhanced MM cell death. Our data thus clearly indicate therapeutic potential of PIK3CA inhibitors and support their clinical evaluation in multiple myeloma.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Complications affect up to 37% of patients hospitalized for injury and increase mortality, morbidity, and costs. One of the keys to controlling complications for injury admissions is to monitor in-hospital complication rates. However, there is no consensus on which complications should be used to evaluate the quality of trauma care. The objective of this study was to develop a consensus-based list of complications that can be used to assess the acute phase of adult trauma care.; METHODS: We used a three-round Web-based Delphi survey among experts in the field of trauma care quality with a broad range of clinical expertise and geographic diversity. The main outcome measure was median importance rating on a 5-point Likert scale (very low to very high); complications with a median of 4 or greater and no disagreement were retained. A secondary measure was the perceived quality of information on each complication available in patient files.; RESULTS: Of 19 experts invited to participate, 17 completed the first (brainstorming) round and 16 (84%) completed all rounds. Of 73 complications generated in Round 1, a total of 25 were retained including adult respiratory distress syndrome, hospital-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound infection, decubitus ulcers, and delirium. Of these, 19 (76%) were perceived to have high-quality or very high-quality information in patient files by more than 50% of the panel members.; CONCLUSION: This study proposes a consensus-based list of 25 complications that can be used to evaluate the quality of acute adult trauma care. These complications can be used to develop an informative and actionable quality indicator to evaluate trauma care with the goal of decreasing rates of hospital complications and thus improving patient outcomes and resource use.

AB Sustainability appraisals produce evidence for how well water governance regimes operate and where problems exist. This evidence is particularly relevant for regions that face water scarcity and conflicts. In this study, we present a criteria-based and participatory sustainability appraisal of water governance in a region with such characteristics-the dry tropics of NW Costa Rica. Data collection included 47 interviews and three stakeholder workshops. The appraisal was conducted through a collaborative and iterative process between researchers and stakeholders. Out of the 25 sustainability criteria used, seven posed a significant challenge for the governance regime. We found challenges faced by the governance regime primarily clustered around and were re-enforced by failing coordination related to the use, management, and protection of groundwater resources; and inadequate leadership to identify collective goals and to constructively deliberate alternative ways of governing water with diverse groups. The appraisal yielded some positive impact in the study area, yet we found its application provided only limited strategic information to support broader problem-solving efforts. Insights from this study suggest key starting points for sustainable water governance in the Central American dry tropics, including investing in increasingly influential collective organizations that are already active in water governance; and leveraging policy windows that can be used to build confidence and disperse more governing authority to regional and local governing actors that are in-tune with the challenges faced in the dry tropics. We conclude the article with reflections on how to produce research results that are actionable for sustainable water governance.

AB There are several unresolved challenges associated with the clinical application of genome-wide sequencing technologies. One of the most discussed issues is incidental findings (IF), which are defined as discoveries made as a result of genetic testing that are unrelated to the indication for the test. The discussion surrounding IF began in the context of research, which we have used to frame consideration of IF in the clinical context. There is growing consensus that analytically valid and medically actionable IF should be offered to patients, but whether and to what extent clinicians should disclose other kinds of IF is debated. While others have systematically reviewed the literature concerning genetic IF, previous reviews focus on ethical and research-related issues and do not consider the implications for the genetic counseling profession specifically. This review discusses the practical considerations, ethical concerns and genetic counseling issues related to IF, with a particular focus on clinical genome-wide sequencing. To date, the bulk of the literature with respect to IF in the clinical context consists of commentaries, reviews and case reports. There is a need for more empirical studies to provide a foundation for institutional protocols and evidence-based clinical practice standards.

AB Use of genomic information in healthcare is increasing; however data on the needs of consumers of genomic information is limited. The Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (CPMC) is a longitudinal study investigating the utility of personalized medicine. Participants receive results reflecting risk of common complex conditions and drug-gene pairs deemed actionable by an external review board. To explore the needs of individuals receiving genomic information we reviewed all genetic counseling sessions with CPMC participants. A retrospective qualitative review of notes from 157 genetic counseling inquiries was conducted. Notes were coded for salient themes. Five primary themes; "understanding risk", "basic genetics", "complex disease genetics", "what do I do now?" and "other" were identified. Further review revealed that participants had difficulty with basic genetic concepts, confused relative and absolute risks, and attributed too high a risk burden to individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these hurdles, counseled participants recognized that behavior changes could potentially mitigate risk and there were few comments alluding to an overly deterministic or fatalistic interpretation of results. Participants appeared to recognize the multifactorial nature of the diseases for which results were provided; however education to understand the complexities of genomic risk information was often needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Public health professionals are increasingly expected to engage in evidence-informed decision making to inform practice and policy decisions. Evidence-informed decision making involves the use of research evidence along with expertise, existing public health resources, knowledge about community health issues, the local context and community, and the political climate. The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools has identified a seven step process for evidence-informed decision making. Tools have been developed to support public health professionals as they work through each of these steps. This paper provides an overview of tools used in three Canadian public health departments involved in a study to develop capacity for evidence-informed decision making.; METHODS: As part of a knowledge translation and exchange intervention, a Knowledge Broker worked with public health professionals to identify and apply tools for use with each of the steps of evidence-informed decision making. The Knowledge Broker maintained a reflective journal and interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of decision makers and public health professionals. This paper presents qualitative analysis of the perceived usefulness and usability of the tools.; RESULTS: Tools were used in the health departments to assist in: question identification and clarification; searching for the best available research evidence; assessing the research evidence for quality through critical appraisal; deciphering the 'actionable message(s)' from the research evidence; tailoring messages to the local context to ensure their relevance and suitability; deciding whether and planning how to implement research evidence in the local context; and evaluating the effectiveness of implementation efforts. Decision makers provided descriptions of how the tools were used within the health departments and made suggestions for improvement. Overall, the tools were perceived as valuable for advancing and sustaining evidence-informed decision making.; CONCLUSION: Tools are available to support the process of evidence-informed decision making among public health professionals. The usability and usefulness of these tools for advancing and sustaining evidence-informed decision making are discussed, including recommendations for the tools' application in other public health settings beyond this study. Knowledge and awareness of these tools may assist other health professionals in their efforts to implement evidence-informed practice.

AB Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Recently, NACT (Neo Adjuvant Chemotherapy) has been tested as alternative approach for the management of ovarian cancer patients. A biological predictor helpful in selecting patients for NACT would be desirable. This study was aimed at identifying actionable mechanisms of resistance to NACT. Expression of a panel of microRNAs was screened in a discovery set of 85 patients. Analysis of the potential targets was conducted in the same RNAs by calculating significant correlations between microRNAs and genes. Quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry was employed in a validation set of 109 patients. MiR-193a-5p was significantly overexpressed in the NACT setting. Analysis of its potential targets demonstrated that this microRNA is also significantly correlated with HGF and MET genes. Analysis of protein expression in samples taken before and after NACT demonstrated that both HGF and c-Met are increased after NACT. Patients who relapse shortly after NACT exhibited the highest relative basal expression of both HGF and c-Met, while the opposite phenomenon was observed in the best responders. Mir-193a-5p, HGF and c-Met expression may help select eligible patients for this modality of treatment. Moreover, inhibitors of this pathway may improve the efficacy of NACT.

AB Professional recommendations for the return of results from exome and whole-genome sequencing (ES/WGS) have been controversial. The lack of clear guidance about whether and, if so, how to return ES/WGS incidental results limits the extent to which individuals and families might benefit from ES/WGS. The perspectives of genetics professionals, particularly those at the forefront of using ES/WGS in clinics, are largely unknown. Data on stakeholder perspectives could help clarify how to weigh expert positions and recommendations. We conducted an online survey of 9,857 genetics professionals to learn their attitudes on the return of incidental results from ES/WGS and the recent American College of Medical Genetic and Genomics Recommendations for Reporting of Incidental Findings in Clinical Exome and Genome Sequencing. Of the 847 respondents, 760 completed the survey. The overwhelming majority of respondents thought that incidental ES/WGS results should be offered to adult patients (85%), healthy adults (75%), and the parents of a child with a medical condition (74%). The majority thought that incidental results about adult-onset conditions (62%) and carrier status (62%) should be offered to the parents of a child with a medical condition. About half thought that offered results should not be limited to those deemed clinically actionable. The vast majority (81%) thought that individual preferences should guide return. Genetics professionals' perspectives on the return of ES/WGS results differed substantially from current recommendations, underscoring the need to establish clear purpose for recommendations on the return of incidental ES/WGS results as professional societies grapple with developing and updating recommendations.

AB Personalized medicine is the cornerstone of medical practice. It tailors treatments for specific conditions of an affected individual. The borders of personalized medicine are defined by limitations in technology and our understanding of biology, physiology and pathology of various conditions. Current advances in technology have provided physicians with the tools to investigate the molecular makeup of the disease. Translating these molecular make-ups to actionable targets has led to the development of small molecular inhibitors. Also, detailed understanding of genetic makeup has allowed us to develop prognostic markers, better known as companion diagnostics. Current attempts in the development of drug delivery systems offer the opportunity of delivering specific inhibitors to affected cells in an attempt to reduce the unwanted side effects of drugs.

AB The amount of data in healthcare is increasing at an astonishing rate. However, in general, the industry has not deployed the level of data management and analysis necessary to make use of those data. As a result, healthcare executives face the risk of being overwhelmed by a flood of unusable data. In this essay I argue that, in order to extract actionable information, leaders must take advantage of the promise of data analytics. Small data, predictive modeling expansion, and real-time analytics are three forms of data analytics. On the basis of my analysis for this study, I recommend all three for adoption. Recognizing the uniqueness of each organization's situation, I also suggest that practices, hospitals, and healthcare systems examine small data and conduct real-time analytics and that large-scale organizations managing populations of patients adopt predictive modeling. I found that all three solutions assist in the collection, management, and analysis of raw data to improve the quality of care and decrease costs.

AB BACKGROUND: Walkrounds, introduced as Leadership (or Executive) WalkRounds, are a widely advocated model for increasing leadership engagement in patient safety to improve safety culture, but evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. In the English National Health Service (NHS), hospitals have been strongly encouraged to make use of methods closely based on the walkrounds approach. A study was conducted to explore how walkrounds are used in practice and to identify variations in implementation that might mediate their impact on safety and culture.; METHODS: The data, collected from 82 semistructured interviews in the English NHS, were drawn from two components of a wider study of culture and behavior around quality and safety in the English system. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method.; FINDINGS: Our analysis highlights how local, pragmatic adjustments to the walkrounds approach could radically alter its character and the way in which it is received by those at the front line. The modification and expansion of walkrounds to increase the scope of knowledge produced could increase the value that executives draw from them. However, it risks replacing the main objectives of walkrounds--specific, actionable knowledge about safety issues, and a more positive safety culture and relationship between ward and board--with a form of surveillance that could alienate frontline staff and produce fallible insights.; CONCLUSION: The studys findings suggest some plausible explanations for the mixed evidence for walkrounds' effectiveness in creating a safety culture. On a practical level, they point to critical questions that executives must ask themselves in practicing interventions of this nature to ensure that adaptations align rather than conflict with the intervention's model of change.

AB Patients with CKD are at high risk for adverse safety events because of the complexity of their care and impaired renal function. Using data from our observational study of predialysis patients with CKD enrolled in the Safe Kidney Care study, we estimated the baseline frequency of adverse safety events and determined to what extent these events co-occur. We examined patient-reported adverse safety incidents (class I) and actionable safety findings (class II), conditioned on participant use of drugs that might cause such an event, and we used association analysis as a data-mining technique to identify co-occurrences of these events. Of 267 participants, 185 (69.3%) had at least one class I or II event, 102 (38.2%) had more than one event, and 48 (18.0%) had at least one event from both classes. The adjusted conditional rates of class I and class II events ranged from 2.9 to 57.6 per 100 patients and from 2.2 to 8.3 per 100 patients, respectively. The most common conditional class I and II events were patient-reported hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia (serum potassium>5.5 mEq/L), respectively. Reporting of hypoglycemia (in patients with diabetes) and falling or severe dizziness (in patients without diabetes) were most frequently paired with other adverse safety events. We conclude that adverse safety events are common and varied in CKD, with frequent association between disparate events. Further work is needed to define the CKD "safety phenotype" and identify patients at highest risk for adverse safety events. Copyright © 2014 by the American Society of Nephrology.

AB Pediatric obesity treatment programs report high attrition rates, but it is unknown if family experience and satisfaction contributes. This review surveys the literature regarding satisfaction in pediatric obesity and questions used in measurement. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline, PsychINFO, and CINAHL. Studies of satisfaction in pediatric weight management were reviewed, and related studies of obesity were included. Satisfaction survey questions were obtained from the articles or from the authors. Eighteen studies were included; 14 quantitative and 4 qualitative. Only one study linked satisfaction to attrition, and none investigated the association of satisfaction and weight outcomes. Most investigations included satisfaction as a secondary aim or used single-item questions of overall satisfaction; only one assessed satisfaction in noncompleters. Overall, participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with obesity treatment or prevention programs. Surveys focused predominantly on overall satisfaction or specific components of the program. Few in-depth studies of satisfaction with pediatric obesity treatment have been conducted. Increased focus on family satisfaction with obesity treatment may provide an avenue to lower attrition rates and improve outcomes. Enhancing measurement of satisfaction to yield actionable responses could positively influence outcomes, and a framework, via patient-centered care principles, is provided.  © 2013 National Association for Healthcare Quality.

AB BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring (RM) of defibrillators (implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs]) and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRTDs) has been shown to be cost effective, convenient, and associated with reduced mortality and a reduction in the time to physician intervention for actionable events. However, patient compliance with monitoring over time and what factors might influence such compliance have not been well described. This study sought to identify factors contributing to patient noncompliance with RM of ICDs and CRTDs in a large real-world population.; METHODS: Deidentified data on U.S. patients enrolled in the Medtronic CareLink RM system were used to compare patients with no (noncompliant, n = 14,848) and with ≥ 2 RM transmissions (compliant, n = 103,284) during a 14-month period.; RESULTS: Overall noncompliance with RM was 21%. Younger age (≤ 40), female sex, wanded device, Medicare Census Division, and small clinic size all predicted patient noncompliance (P < 0.01). Device type (ICD vs CRTD) did not (P = 0.52). Multivariate analysis suggested clinically important predictors of noncompliance to be: age ≤ 40, odds ratio (OR) 2.64 (95% confidence interval, 2.42-2.88); Medicare Census Division (Mountain vs West North Central), OR 2.15 (1.96-2.37); and small clinic size (1-4 vs >100 patients), OR 4.38 (3.92-4.91).; CONCLUSIONS: There is room for improvement in RM usage among enrolled patients. Younger patients, smaller clinics, and certain geographic areas may be targets for research into interventions to further improve the use of RM. ©2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB As the largest single payer for health care in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) generates enormous amounts of data. Historically, CMS has faced technological challenges in storing, analyzing, and disseminating this information because of its volume and privacy concerns. However, rapid progress in the fields of data architecture, storage, and analysis--the big-data revolution--over the past several years has given CMS the capabilities to use data in new and innovative ways. We describe the different types of CMS data being used both internally and externally, and we highlight a selection of innovative ways in which big-data techniques are being used to generate actionable information from CMS data more effectively. These include the use of real-time analytics for program monitoring and detecting fraud and abuse and the increased provision of data to providers, researchers, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders.

AB The goal of comparative effectiveness research is to assess medical therapies and allow patients, health care providers, payers, and policy makers to make evidence-based decisions about the most appropriate therapies in routine clinical practice. To conduct this type of research and to inform health care delivery, data about the impact of interventions on patient outcomes are needed. Methods of generating evidence for comparative effectiveness research provide opportunities to engage patients and understand their experiences with illness and its treatment. In this article we assess the need for, uses of, and strengths and weaknesses of patient-generated data. We also review in brief federal and medical society efforts to create new streams of patient-generated data for clinical and research use. We observe that the key to high-quality patient-generated data is to have immediate and actionable data so that patients experience the importance of the data for their own care as well as research purposes. We conclude that leveraging the emerging wealth of "big data" being generated by patient-facing technologies such as systems to collect patient-reported outcomes data and patient-worn sensors is critical to developing the evidence base that informs decisions made by patients, providers, and policy makers in pursuit of high-value medical care.

AB Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to characterize the overall genomic landscape of melanomas. Here, we systematically examined mutations from recently published melanoma NGS data involving 241 paired tumor-normal samples to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations. Melanomas were characterized according to an in-house clinical assay that identifies well-known specific recurrent mutations in five driver genes: BRAF (affecting V600), NRAS (G12, G13, and Q61), KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816), GNAQ (Q209), and GNA11 (Q209). Tumors with none of these mutations are termed "pan negative." We then mined the driver mutation-positive and pan-negative melanoma NGS data for mutations in 632 cancer genes that could influence existing or emerging targeted therapies. First, we uncovered several genes whose mutations were more likely associated with BRAF- or NRAS-driven melanomas, including TP53 and COL1A1 with BRAF, and PPP6C, KALRN, PIK3R4, TRPM6, GUCY2C, and PRKAA2 with NRAS. Second, we found that the 69 "pan-negative" melanoma genomes harbored alternate infrequent mutations in the five known driver genes along with many mutations in genes encoding guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha-subunits. Third, we identified 12 significantly mutated genes in "pan-negative" samples (ALK, STK31, DGKI, RAC1, EPHA4, ADAMTS18, EPHA7, ERBB4, TAF1L, NF1, SYK, and KDR), including five genes (RAC1, ADAMTS18, EPHA7, TAF1L, and NF1) with a recurrent mutation in at least two "pan-negative" tumor samples. This meta-analysis provides a road map for the study of additional potentially actionable genes in both driver mutation-positive and pan-negative melanomas. ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: Approaches to return individual results to participants in genomic research variably focus on actionability, duty to share, or participants' preferences. Our group at Boston Children's Hospital has prioritized participants' preferences by implementing the Gene Partnership, a genomic research repository, based on the "Informed Cohort" model that offers return of results in accordance with participant preferences. Recognizing that ethical oversight is essential, the Gene Partnership Informed Cohort Oversight Board was convened in 2009.; METHODS: Over 3 years, the Informed Cohort Oversight Board developed guidelines for the return of individual genomic research results.; RESULTS: The Informed Cohort Oversight Board defined its guiding principles as follows: to respect the developing autonomy of pediatric participants and parental decision-making authority by returning results consistent with participants' preferences and to protect participants from harm. Potential harms and strategies to eliminate harm were identified. Guidelines were developed for participant preferences that consider the child's development and family dynamics. The Informed Cohort Oversight Board agreed that to prevent harm, including harms related to interfering with a child's future autonomy, there will be results that should not be returned regardless of participant preferences.; CONCLUSION: The Informed Cohort Oversight Board developed guidelines for the return of results that respect the preferences of parents, children, and adult participants while seeking to protect against harm.

AB The NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary tumors provide recommendations for the evaluation, workup, management, and follow-up of patients with occult primary tumors (cancers of unknown primary). These NCCN Guidelines Insights summarize major discussion points of the 2014 NCCN Occult Primary panel meeting. The panel discussed gene expression profiling (GEP) for the identification of the tissue of origin and concluded that, although GEP has a diagnostic benefit, a clinical benefit has not been demonstrated. The panel recommends against GEP as standard management, although 20% of the panel believes the diagnostic benefit of GEP warrants its routine use. In addition, the panel discussed testing for actionable mutations (eg, ALK) to help guide choice of therapy, but declined to add this recommendation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare asthma control assessment using the Asthma APGAR system, a tool developed by primary care clinicians, in a multicenter primary care sample with the Asthma Control Test (ACT)/Childhood Asthma Control Test (CACT), a tool developed by asthma specialists.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a substudy of a multicenter, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of the Asthma APGAR system in primary care practices. As part of the study, enrolled patients completed both the ACT/CACT and the Asthma APGAR system between March 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the results of questionnaires.; RESULTS: Of the 468 patients in our sample, 306 (65%) were classified as not controlled by the ACT/CACT or the Asthma APGAR system. The overall agreement was 84.4%, with a kappa value of .68 (substantial agreement) and a McNemar test P value of .35 (suggesting no significant difference in the direction of disagreement). Of those with poor control as defined by the Asthma APGAR system, 23.8% (73) had no controller medications and 76.5% (234) were seldom or sometimes able to avoid identified triggers for their asthma. Of those who stated that they had been prescribed controller medications, 116 of 332 (35%) stated that they did not use the controller medication on a daily basis.; CONCLUSION: The Asthma APGAR system and the ACT/CACT similarly assess asthma control in a multicenter primary care-based sample. The Asthma APGAR system identified an "actionable item" in more than 75% (234) of the individuals with poor asthma control, thus linking an assessment of poor asthma control with a management strategy.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this project was to develop a set of quality indicators to assess surgical decision making in the care of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).; METHODS: A multidisciplinary Expert Panel of 16 physicians used a modified Delphi process to identify quality indicators that evaluated the processes of care in patients with NSCLC. A systematic review identified potential indicators, which were rated on actionability, validity, usefulness, discriminability, and feasibility in two rounds of questionnaires. The first questionnaire was completed by the Expert Panel and by the larger thoracic surgical community of practice; the second questionnaire was sent to only the Expert Panel. Expert Panel members attended an in-person meeting to review the results of the two questionnaires and to compile the final list of indicators by consensus.; RESULTS: From the literature review, 41 potential indicators were identified. An additional 16 indicators were suggested by the Expert Panel: 13 indicators in thetwo rounds of questionnaires and three after the discussion at the in-person meeting. One further indicator was identified after the in-person meeting. In the end, 17 indicators were chosen from seven domains: preoperative assessment, staging, surgical procedures, pathology, adjuvant therapy, surgical outcomes, and miscellaneous; CONCLUSIONS: By use of a modified Delphi process, 17 indicators to assess the quality of processes of surgical care for patients with NSCLC were developed.

AB PURPOSE: Multiple-gene sequencing is entering practice, but its clinical value is unknown. We evaluated the performance of a customized germline-DNA sequencing panel for cancer-risk assessment in a representative clinical sample.; METHODS: Patients referred for clinical BRCA1/2 testing from 2002 to 2012 were invited to donate a research blood sample. Samples were frozen at -80° C, and DNA was extracted from them after 1 to 10 years. The entire coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and all known pathogenic variants in other regions were sequenced for 42 genes that had cancer risk associations. Potentially actionable results were disclosed to participants.; RESULTS: In total, 198 women participated in the study: 174 had breast cancer and 57 carried germline BRCA1/2 mutations. BRCA1/2 analysis was fully concordant with prior testing. Sixteen pathogenic variants were identified in ATM, BLM, CDH1, CDKN2A, MUTYH, MLH1, NBN, PRSS1, and SLX4 among 141 women without BRCA1/2 mutations. Fourteen participants carried 15 pathogenic variants, warranting a possible change in care; they were invited for targeted screening recommendations, enabling early detection and removal of a tubular adenoma by colonoscopy. Participants carried an average of 2.1 variants of uncertain significance among 42 genes.; CONCLUSION: Among women testing negative for BRCA1/2 mutations, multiple-gene sequencing identified 16 potentially pathogenic mutations in other genes (11.4%; 95% CI, 7.0% to 17.7%), of which 15 (10.6%; 95% CI, 6.5% to 16.9%) prompted consideration of a change in care, enabling early detection of a precancerous colon polyp. Additional studies are required to quantify the penetrance of identified mutations and determine clinical utility. However, these results suggest that multiple-gene sequencing may benefit appropriately selected patients. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB The patient׳s experiences and costs related to their care are largely dictated by each patient-physician interaction along the continuum of care. However, the amount of time that a physician spends with a patient creating a medical action plan is highly variable and often not related to the severity or complexity of the patient׳s condition. Adding a structured process to guide and inform patient-physician encounters, including outlining expectations and follow-up by both sides is needed. Addressing these barriers to the physician-patient relationship would reduce variation in care, minimize unnecessary trial and error tactics and instead focus on predicted cost effective actions.

AB Drug response shows significant interpatient variability and evidence that genetics influences outcome of drug therapy has been known for more than five decades. However, the translation of this knowledge to clinical practice remains slow. Using examples from clinical practice six considerations about the implementation of pharmacogenetics (PGx) into routine care are discussed: the need for PGx biomarkers; the sources of genetic variability in drug response; the amount of variability explained by PGx; whether PGx test results are actionable; the level of evidence needed for implementation of PGx and the sources of information regarding interpretation of PGx data.

AB Molecular testing for oncogenic gene alterations provides clinically actionable information essential for the optimal management of follicular cell thyroid cancer. We aimed to establish the distribution and frequency of common oncogenic gene mutations and chromosomal rearrangements in a comprehensive set of benign and malignant thyroid lesions. A case-control study was conducted in 413 surgical cases comprising 17 distinct histopathologic categories, 244 malignant, 169 benign, and 304 double-blinded specimens. Seventeen alterations of BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PAX8, and RET genes were evaluated using a single validated technology platform. Following verification of analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and precision in model and surgical specimens, 152 molecular positive results were generated in lesions representing multiple stages of progression and epithelial differentiation as well as rare subtypes of primary, secondary, or recurring tumors. Single mutations were found in 58% of primary malignant lesions and 12% of benign (P < .001). In the blinded validation set, mutation distribution and frequency were distinct across variants of follicular and papillary carcinomas. BRAF or RET-PTC was detected exclusively in malignant lesions but not in follicular carcinomas (P < .001). RAS or PAX8-PPARG were present in 23% of adenomas, and NRAS was found in a single nonneoplastic lesion (P = .0014). These data substantiate the diagnostic utility of molecular testing for oncogenic mutations and validate its performance in a variety of surgical specimens. Standardized and validated multianalyte molecular panels can complement the preoperative and postoperative assessment of thyroid nodules and support a growing number of clinical and translational applications with potential diagnostic, prognostic, or theranostic utility.

AB UNLABELLED: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive malignancy and the most effective treatment regime has a high relapse rate. Increasingly, the development of therapies involves defining drug-diagnostic combinations where the presence of a molecular target or marker identifies patients who are most likely to respond to a specific therapy. Trials in other solid cancers have demonstrated clear utility in the incorporation of biomarkers to stratify patients to targeted treatment, however, there are no mutations that are currently used to inform treatment options for GBM.; AIMS: We piloted the use of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology to identify genetic mutations in 44 GBM specimens that may be amenable to current or future targeted therapeutic strategies.; METHOD: Somatic mutation profiling was performed using the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 and semiconductor sequencing technology.; RESULTS: A total of 66 mutations were detected in 35/44 (80%) patients. The number of mutations per tumour ranged from 0 to 4 (average per tumour=1.5). The most frequent mutations were in TP53 (n=12), PTEN (n=9), EGFR (n=8) and PIK3CA (n=5). Clinically actionable somatic mutations were detected in 24/35 (69%) patients.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the use of an 'off-the-shelf' oncogene primer panel and benchtop next-generation sequencer can identify mutations and potentially actionable targets in the majority of GBM patients. Data from this pilot highlights the potential for targeted genetic resequencing to identify mutations that may inform treatment options and predict outcomes.

AB The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is aberrantly activated in a number of tumors. In medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, mutations in Hh pathway genes lead to ligand-independent pathway activation. In many other tumor types, ligand-dependent activation of Hh signaling is potentiated through crosstalk with other critical molecular signaling pathways. Among such pathways, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, and Notch are of particular interest because agents that selectively inhibit these pathways are available and can be readily combined with agents such as vismodegib, sonidegib (LDE225), and BMS-833923, which target smoothened-a key Hh pathway regulator. Numerous preclinical studies have revealed the ways in which Hh intersects with each of these pathways, and combination therapies have resulted in improved antitumor efficacy and survival in animal models. Hh also plays an important role in hematopoiesis and in the maintenance of BCR-ABL-driven leukemic stem cells. Thus, combined inhibition of the Hh pathway and BCR-ABL has emerged as a promising potential therapeutic strategy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A number of clinical trials evaluating combinations of Hh inhibitors with other targeted agents are now underway in CML and a variety of solid tumors. This review highlights these trials and summarizes preclinical evidence of crosstalk between Hh and four other actionable pathways-RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, and Notch-as well as the role of Hh in the maintenance of BCR-ABL-driven leukemic stem cells.

AB Our goal was to evaluate the Bethesda system (TBS) in comparison to the previously used system at our institution. One hundred consecutive thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) and 45 consecutive indeterminate FNAs were reviewed by two cytopathology-boarded pathologists, diagnosed based on TBS and correlated with management and follow-up. Re-evaluation led to a diagnosis change in 48% of cases. Thirty-nine percent of benign cases were unsatisfactory under TBS. For malignant diagnoses the positive predictive value (PPV) was unchanged, while the negative predictive value (NPV) was slightly improved using TBS. Both the PPV and NPV were improved for actionable diagnoses. Inter-observer variability across all categories was in moderate agreement. Clinical management of both follicular lesion (FL) and indeterminate cases ranged from none to immediate surgery. Repeat FNA resolved the diagnosis in 50% of indeterminate cases. Indeterminate cases had an overall malignancy rate of 27%; higher in pre- (46%) than post-TBS cases (8%). Inter-observer variability between the reviewing pathologists and the original pathologists for indeterminate cases was fair, and between the two reviewing pathologists was moderate. Using TBS criteria increased the unsatisfactory rate and led to improved prediction of malignancy and actionable diagnoses. The pre-Bethesda diagnosis of FL at our institution led to inconsistent clinical management. Clinical management of patients with indeterminate diagnoses was essentially unchanged following adoption of TBS. The moderate inter-observer agreement between the reviewing pathologists may be related to level of cytology experience, strict adherence to TBS, and the exclusive use of cytomorphology for diagnosis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The Reno Orthopaedic Center (ROC) Trauma Fellowship business curriculum is designed to provide the fellow with a graduate level business practicum and research experience. The time commitments in a typical 12-month trauma fellowship are significant, rendering a traditional didactic master's in business administration difficult to complete during this short time. An organized, structured, practical business education can provide the trauma leaders of tomorrow with the knowledge and experience required to effectively navigate the convoluted and constantly changing healthcare system. The underlying principle throughout the curriculum is to provide the fellow with the practical knowledge to participate in cost-efficient improvements in healthcare delivery. Through the ROC Trauma Fellowship business curriculum, the fellow will learn that delivering healthcare in a manner that provides better outcomes for equal or lower costs is not only possible but a professional and ethical responsibility. However, instilling these values without providing actionable knowledge and programs would be insufficient and ineffective. For this reason, the core of the curriculum is based on individual teaching sessions with a wide array of hospital and private practice administrators. In addition, each section is equipped with a suggested reading list to maximize the learning experience. Upon completion of the curriculum, the fellow should be able to: (1) Participate in strategic planning at both the hospital and practice level based on analysis of financial and clinical data, (2) Understand the function of healthcare systems at both a macro and micro level, (3) Possess the knowledge and skills to be strong leaders and effective communicators in the business lexicon of healthcare, (4) Be a partner and innovator in the improvement of the delivery of orthopaedic services, (5) Combine scientific and strategic viewpoints to provide an evidence-based strategy for improving quality of care in a cost-efficient manner, (6) Understand the political, economic, and strategic basics of private practice orthopaedics.

AB Somatic sequencing of cancers has produced new insight into tumorigenesis, tumor heterogeneity, and disease progression, but the vast majority of genetic events identified are of indeterminate clinical significance. Here, we describe a NextGen sequencing approach to fully analyzing 248 genes, including all those of known clinical significance in melanoma. This strategy features solution capture of DNA followed by multiplexed, high-throughput sequencing and was evaluated in 31 melanoma cell lines and 18 tumor tissues from patients with metastatic melanoma. Mutations in melanoma cell lines correlated with their sensitivity to corresponding small molecule inhibitors, confirming, for example, lapatinib sensitivity in ERBB4 mutant lines and identifying a novel activating mutation of BRAF. The latter event would not have been identified by clinical sequencing and was associated with responsiveness to a BRAF kinase inhibitor. This approach identified focal copy number changes of PTEN not found by standard methods, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Actionable mutations were found in 89% of the tumor tissues analyzed, 56% of which would not be identified by standard-of-care approaches. This work shows that targeted sequencing is an attractive approach for clinical use in melanoma. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe acute care length of stay (LOS) over all consecutive hospitalizations for the injury and according to level of care [intensive care unit (ICU), intermediate care, general ward], compare observed and expected LOS, and identify predictors of LOS.; BACKGROUND: Prolonged LOS has important consequences in terms of costs and outcome, yet detailed information on LOS after trauma is lacking.; METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study was based on adults discharged alive from a Canadian trauma system (1999-2010; n = 126,513). Registry data were used to calculate index LOS (LOS in trauma center with highest designation level) and were linked to hospital discharge data to calculate total LOS (all consecutive hospitalizations for the injury). Expected LOS was obtained by matching general provincial discharge statistics to study data by year, age, and sex. Potential predictors of LOS were evaluated using linear regression.; RESULTS: Mean index and total LOS were 8.6 and 9.4 days, respectively. ICU, intermediate care unit, and general ward care constituted 8.9%, 2.5%, and 88.6% of total hospital days. Observed mean index and ICU LOS in our trauma patients were 2.9 and 1.3 days longer than expected LOS (P < 0.0001). The strongest determinants of index LOS were discharge destination, age, transfer status, and injury severity.; CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that acute care LOS after injury is underestimated when only information on the index hospitalization is used and that ICU or intermediate care constitute an important part of LOS. This information should be used to inform the development of an informative and actionable quality indicator.
