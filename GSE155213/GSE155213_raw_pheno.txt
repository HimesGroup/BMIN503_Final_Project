Briefly, the bronchoscope was wedged into a subsegment of either the right middle lobe or lingula, followed by instillation of 50-mL aliquots of sterile, room temperature 0.9% saline. Each 50-mL aliquot (up to four total) was immediately hand aspirated back into the syringe, then transferred to sterile 50-mL conical tubes, whereupon they were transported to the laboratory. The first aliquot of BAL was not used in these experiments. Second and subsequent BAL aliquots were combined, then centrifuged to separate cellular and acellular components. Cell counts were performed, and ≥ 95% BAL cell viability was determined for all subjects via trypan blue exclusion. Differentials were assessed after Diff-Quik staining by a single blinded observer. A proportion of BAL cells were snap frozen for RNA applications, while the remainder were used in ex vivo cell culture experiments.	RNA library creation and sequencing were performed at the Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core in two batches: Batch 1 (TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit and Illumina HiSeq4000; Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) and Batch 2 (Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit, HiSeq2500) using manufacturer directions.

Using skewer v0.2.2, we removed Illumina universal library adaptors, trimmed the end of the read until bases had Phred Q-Score ≥ 10, and removed reads with length ≤31bp after trimming.	We used kallisto6 v0.46.0 for pseudo-alignment, with reference to the Ensembl v79 Homo sapiens genome assembly (pre-indexed by the kallisto developers).
