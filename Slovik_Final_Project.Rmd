### Overview
The opioid epidemic is a serious public health problem in the United States. The National Vital Statistics System provides data made available by the CDC and U.S. Department of Health regarding national mortality for drug overdoses over the past several years. The goal of this project is to perform statistical analyses to learn about the relationships between variables in the data set, geospatial analyses to understand the critical centers of the epidemic, as well as forcasting to predict future overdose trajectories.

### Introduction 
Over the past 20 years, the United States has experienced an increase in the amount of deaths that can be attributed to drug overdoses.  In particular, opioids have been at the heart of this problem, including both prescription medications and illegal opioids. Opioids are used to treat pain by interacting with opioid receptors in the body and brain. In addition to pain relief, opioids also elicit a feeling of pleasure.  This combination of pain relief and pleasure provides some explanation for the addictive quality of opioid drugs. Over-prescribing by clinicians and access to illicit drugs have allowed this to become a severe epidemic that has shown little indication of slowing down, that both local and national agencies are attempting to address. 

To understand the nature of the problem of drug overdose mortality, an interdisciplinary approach can provide the most insight.  Firstly this is a public health issue, requiring the knowledge of clinicians, psychiatrists, and public health officials. This is also an economic and geographic issue, as socioeconomic status and location may have a large affect on drug overdose mortality. Using additional data sets from SAMHSA, NIDA and the DEA to integrate with the drug overdose mortality data will provide more insight for correlative analysis and trends regarding the opioid epidemic.

### Methods
The primary data set used for this project was obtained from the publicly available data from the National Vital Statistics System.  The link to the data download is [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/vsrr-provisional-drug-overdose-death-counts-54e35). The data analyzed is titled "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts" and contains provisional monthly counts for drug overdose deaths and total number of deaths (from mortality data) for all 50 states in the United States over the years 2015-2017.  The data also includes information on the specific drug categories determined to be the cause of overdose for 18 states.

The main goal is to analyze the data with some exploratory analysis as well as graphical analysis to visualize data in a meaningful way to help understand the scale and severity of the opioid epidemic in the United States.

First, necessary packages are loaded.
```{r, message=FALSE}
# load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tigris)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(grid)
library(leaflet)
library(forecast)
library(ggthemes)
```

Next, data needs to be loaded and cleaned for analysis. The `dplyr` package from `tidyverse` will be used to organize the data. First, all of the necessary variables will be created to perform some geospatial analysis to look at the total number of drug overdoses by state for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Our map shapefile was downloaded from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html). The package `sf` is used to import the shapefile as an sf object.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load in data
data <- read.csv("VSRR_drug_od.csv", header=TRUE)

# need for subsequent analysis
drop.cols <- "State.Name"

# total deaths by state for each year
totalDeathsbyState <- data %>% 
  select(-one_of(drop.cols)) %>%
  group_by(State, Year, Indicator) %>%
  filter(Year %in% c("2015", "2016", "2017"), 
         Indicator == "Number of Deaths", 
         State != "US",
         State != "YC") %>%
  summarize(TotalDeath = sum(Data.Value))

drugODbyState <- data %>% 
  select(-one_of(drop.cols)) %>%
  group_by(State, Year, Indicator) %>%
  filter(Year  %in% c("2015", "2016", "2017"), 
         Indicator == "Number of Drug Overdose Deaths",
         State != "US",
         State != "YC") %>%
  summarize(TotalODDeath = sum(Data.Value))

totalDeathsandOD <- inner_join(drugODbyState, totalDeathsbyState, by=c("State", "Year"))
percentOD <- totalDeathsandOD %>%
  mutate(percent = ((TotalODDeath / TotalDeath) * 100))

# importing state shapefile as sf object
US.sf <- st_read("cb_2017_us_state_20m/cb_2017_us_state_20m.shp")
str(US.sf)
US.sf <- US.sf %>%
  select(STATENS, AFFGEOID, GEOID, STUSPS, NAME, LSAD, ALAND, AWATER, geometry) %>%
  rename(State='STUSPS')

# need to join data here so we can plot stuff!
USdeaths <- inner_join(US.sf, drugODbyState, by = "State")
```

Now, we can visualize the total number of overdose deaths across the entire United States by implementing the package `tmap`. Using a for loop to iterate over the 3 years of interest, a static map for each year can be generated and saved.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# setting up for plotting static maps
for (year in list("2015", "2016", "2017")){

US_cont <- USdeaths %>% 
  filter(Year == year) %>%
  subset(!GEOID %in% c("02", "15", "72")) %>% 
  simplify_shape(0.2)

US_AK <- USdeaths %>%
  filter(Year == year) %>%
  subset(GEOID == "02") %>% 
  simplify_shape(0.2) 

US_HI <- USdeaths %>% 
  filter(Year == year) %>%
  subset(GEOID == "15") %>% 
  simplify_shape(0.2) 

US_states <- US_cont %>% 
  dplyr::select(geometry) %>% 
  aggregate(by = list(US_cont$State), FUN = mean)

# Contiguous US map
m_cont <- tm_shape(US_cont, projection = 2163) +
  tm_polygons("TotalODDeath", title = "Number of Deaths", showNA = FALSE,
              border.col = "white", border.alpha = .5,
              style = "fixed",
              labels = c("0 to 1k", "1k to 2.5k", 
                         "2.5k to 5k", "5k to 10k",

            frame = FALSE,
            inner.margins = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))

m_AK <-  tm_shape(US_AK, projection = 3338) +
  tm_polygons("TotalODDeath",

                         "10k to 15k", "15k to 25k", 
                         "25k to 50k", "50k to 100k"),
              breaks = c(0, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 15000, 25000, 50000, 100000), 
              palette = "YlOrRd") + 
  tm_layout("Alaska",
            legend.show = FALSE,
            bg.color = NA,
            title.size = 0.8,
            frame = FALSE)

# Hawaii map
m_HI <-  tm_shape(US_HI, projection = 3759) +
  tm_polygons("TotalODDeath",
              border.col = "white",
              border.alpha = .5,
              style = "fixed",
              labels = c("0 to 1k", "1k to 2.5k", 
                         "2.5k to 5k", "5k to 10k", 
                         "10k to 15k", "15k to 25k", 
                         "25k to 50k", "50k to 100k"),
              breaks = c(0, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 15000, 25000, 50000, 100000),
              palette = "YlOrRd") +
  tm_layout("Hawaii",
            legend.show = FALSE,

            title.position = c("LEFT", "BOTTOM"),
            title.size = 0.8,
            frame = FALSE)

# Use grid package to set where AK and HI map should be plotted on the contiguous map
vp_AK <- viewport(x = 0.15, y = 0.15, width = 0.3, height = 0.3)
vp_HI <- viewport(x = 0.4, y = 0.1, width = 0.2, height = 0.1)

# plot map to save individual figures
tmap_save(m_cont, 
          insets_tm = list(m_AK, m_HI), 
          insets_vp = list(vp_AK, vp_HI),
          filename=paste("ODinUS", year, ".png", sep=""))
graphics.off() # clears after each plot
}
```

The exported `.png` maps can be re-imported and printed for viewing:
![](ODinUS2015.png)
![](ODinUS2016.png)
![](ODinUS2017.png)

Next, the percentage of deaths attributed to drug overdoses was calculated for each state for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.  The data for each year can be plotted as a interactive choropleth map using the `leaflet` package. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# OD percentage join with shapefile
percentODinUS <- inner_join(US.sf, percentOD, by = "State")
ODmap2015 <- percentODinUS %>% filter(Year == "2015")
ODmap2016 <- percentODinUS %>% filter(Year == "2016")
ODmap2017 <- percentODinUS %>% filter(Year == "2017")

**Want to implement a leaflet map to show percent change from 2015 to 2017... need to play with the data though**
