# Variables to be included in models

## Variables from the Linked Birth and Death Certificate Data

There are data available from the CDC Wonder queries regarding the outcome of data including through 2017. These data do not have a linked birth and death cohort available through that late of a date. The most recent data set avialable through the National Economic Research Bureau is 2013. There is; however, linked birth and death certificate for both the numerator of all deaths as well as the denominator of all births. 

Variables to be included in models:
