# 1. Check for duplicates
# NOTE: At last count there are 3126 in terms of FULL_PROJECT_NUM, PI_IDS, PUB_
# TITLE, and SUBPROJECT_ID

  poss_duplicates <- select(data, FULL_PROJECT_NUM, PI_IDS, PUB_TITLE)

  # Remove duplicates
  data <- distinct(data, FULL_PROJECT_NUM, PI_IDS, PUB_TITLE, 
                   .keep_all = TRUE)
  
  
# 2. Relabel variables 
# TODO: undoubtedly there is redundancy in the ORG_NAME variable. Ex: 'Albert 
# Einstein College of Medicine' and 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, INC'
# However, a quick glance shows it is not egregious and largely 
# will be skipped for now. 

  # STUDY_SECTION_NAME  
  data$STUDY_SECTION_NAME <- gsub(" $", "", data$STUDY_SECTION_NAME)
  
  # PI_IDS
  data$PI_IDS <- gsub(";", "", data$PI_IDS) # some only contain ';'
  data$PI_IDS <- gsub(" ", "", data$PI_IDS) # some have random spaces
  

# 3. Check for missingness
# NOTE: Only missingness is for records that didn't have SCImago data (about 1/3)

sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

  # Drop observations that have missing PI_IDS (n = 11)
  data <- filter(data, !is.na(PI_IDS))


# 4. Fix classes 
# NOTE: ISSNs have characters, sometimes (ex: 1931857X)
# Interestingly, sapply used too much memory.

# 5. Date variables processing

    data <- filter(data, BUDGET_START < "2017-12-31")

# 6. Constructing new variables 
  
  # Publication counts 
  # NOTE: each APPLICATION_ID corresponds to a unique FULL_PROJECT_NUM.
  # We want the number of publications for each PI before a particular
  # FULL_PROJECT_NUM was funded.

  data[, count_grants := cumsum(grants)-1, by = "PI_IDS"]
  
  # Log-transformed outcome variable TOTAL_COST
  data <- mutate(data, TOTAL_COST_log = log(TOTAL_COST))
  
  
# 7. Remove unnecessary variables, objects

               STUDY_SECTION_NAME, TOTAL_COST, pubs_to_date,
