Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation in class will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name and text below with your own, but leave the headers.

### Overview
In this section, give a brief a description of your project and its goal, what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

The goal of my project is to characterize the use and effectiveness of blood cultures for detecting bloodstream infections in patients at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). I will be using data from monthly reports of blood cultures at HUP for FY2015.

### Introduction 
In the first paragraph, describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

In the second paragraph, explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Blood cultures are frequently used and are important for detecting the presence of microbes in the bloodstream. However, excessive use of blood cultures can be detrimental to patients and may not significantly contribute to patient care. Furthermore, there are different guidelines for blood culture utilization, and it is unclear to what extent health professionals are aware of these guidelines. Investigating blood culture utilization is critical for improving the practice of blood cultures, their effectiveness in detecting bloodstream infections, and patient care management. In addition, analyzing blood cultures data may reveal information on the frequency of false positives due to contamination and the prevalence of bacteremia in different patient populations. In addiiton, analysis of blood cultures utilization data may result in the dentification of low-risk populations for bacteremia, which may will help reduce unnecessary use of blood cultures. Finally, analysis of high-utilizers of blood cultures may also be useful for addressing the practice of blood cultures utilization.

This is an interdisciplinary problem that draws knowledge from data science, clinical microbiology, statistics, and data visualization. I have been working with Dr. Irv Nachamkin, Director of the Divison of Laboratory Medicine at HUP. He has helped direct me to relevant analyses based on his domain knowledge of clinical microbiology. I have also met with Dr. Rebecca Hubbard, Associate Professor of Biostatistics. She gave me useful advice on conducting linear regressions on my data and visualizing the data.



### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 

I will be using monthly reports of blood cultures utilization at HUP for FY2015. This is a record that includes information for each patient who had blood drawn for a blood culture test. The report shows the number of sets of blood cultures taken per day, the location by hospital floor, whether a phlebotomist drew the culture, and the final result (ex. no growth or the name of the microbial species isolated). 

I will first use descriptive statistics to look at the distribution of sets of blood cultures taken per patient and by hospital floor. I will also look at the distribution of pathogens isolated. Then, I will analyze the number of follow-up cultures taken after a positive identification to test the hypothesis that the number of sets of blood cultures taken is linked to the organism identified. I will also analyze the high utilizers to see what floors they are coming from and whether there is an association.

### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

I am first looking at the overall distribution of number of blood cultures taken per patient and by location. This is a highly skewed distribution. Of 45,767 sets of blood cultures taken in FY2015, there were 11,737 different patients (based on MRN). I will be using the 45,757 complete cases (11,735 patients) for subsequent analyses. The number of sets taken ranged from 1 to 90, with a median of 2 and a mean of 3.899 sets. The number of days in between sets ranged from 0 to 364, with a median of 0 and a mean of 30.82. This is because some patients had multiple hospital visits within FY2015. Of 125 locations where patients had blood cultures taken in FY2015, the number of sets ranged from 1 to 4531, with a median of 17 and a mean of 366.1.

Since we don't have information on the length of each patient's hospital encounter, I will split the bc into 30-day periods, which is a reasonable amount of time to clear an infection and probably accounts for the duration of most hospital stays. After splitting into 30-day periods, the number of bc taken ranged from 1 to 52, with a median of 2 and a mean of 3.084.

Next, I will use descriptive statistics to characterize the rate of contamination and of positive identification. I will also look at the distribution of pathogens isolated.

Of 45,767 sets taken, there are 45,752 sets included in this analysis after cleaning up the data. 426 sets were contaminated, which gives a contamination rate of 0.93%. 3,484 cultures yielded a positive identification, which gives a rate of 7.6%. There were 151 different pathogens identified (after grouping some species). The number of times a pathogen was identified ranged from 1 to 763, with a median of 3 and a mean of 22.65.

```{r Descriptive statistics on isolation of pathogens}
#Look at the frequency of contamination and of positive identification. Look at distribution of pathogens isolated.
#I will be using the dataframe cultures, since that has been cleaned up. I will be using the Final_Report column for ease of readability, since this contains abbreviations of the isolates, and some of the species have been grouped together for ease of analysis.

289 out of 11,737 patients had at least 20 blood cultures taken, which is 2.46% of the population. For this subpopulation, the number of sets taken ranged from 20 to 90, with a median of 26 and a mean of 30.86.

Based on a linear regression, the following pathogens are statistically significant in the model: Sv, Stawar,STACAPI, Serliq, SA, Rhoequ, Raoorn, CANTRO, Cankru, Bacova,ACISPE.

Based on  a linear regression, the following locations are statistically significant in a model for predicting number of bc in a 30-day period: MICB, RP6, RP7, SICA, SICB, SINA, SINB, SIRA, SIRB


Look at just the pathogens that were statistically significantly associated with number of follow-up cultures.
