Brief Hospital Course:
Pt had a difficult hospital stay

Pt admitted on [**2128-3-19**] for a right leg ischemia

Pt underwent the following procedures on [**2128-3-19**]
1. Thrombectomy of right femoral to peroneal artery in-situ
   saphenous vein graft.
2. Revision vein graft with vein patch angioplasty using left
   arm cephalic vein.
3. Harvest of upper arm extremity vein.

After procedure pt admitted to PACU then VICU, early post up pt
experienced EKG changes, specifically for ST depression V3-V5,
had Brief runs NSVT and also complained of some chest pain. A
cardiology consult was obtained. Pt R/I for NSTEMI.

On [**2128-3-21**] Pt experienced with resp. failure. Pt was transferd to
the SICU for observation. Later in the day pt condition became
worse. Pt had to intubated and at this time pt recieved a R IJ
CVL.  A chest X-Ray showed resp. failure. Pt dalso experienced
ARF secondary to hypotensive episode experienced with his
NSTEMI.

During this time pt was aggressively treated for both CHF and
ARF, both which resolved during his stay in the SICU.

On [**3-22**] pt underwent Cardiac catherization. The catherization
showed:

1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system with
left-main and 3-vessel coronary disease.
2.  The LMCA had a hazy proximal
95% stenosis and a distal tapering 50% stenosis.
3.  The LAD was diffusely diseased with serial proximal and
mid-vessel 60% stenoses and an 80% long tubular stenosis in the
distal vessel.
4.  The LCx had severe diffuse disease and a 70% stenosis in the
mid-vessel involving the origin of the OM1 branch.  The RCA had
severe diffuse disease up to 50-60% throughout with a focal 80%
stenosis of the RPL branch.
5.  Echo showed an ejection fraction of 35% with anterior
hypokinesis.  He is thus referred for cardiac catheterization
for
evaluation of coronary anatomy

Cardiology decided to do an intervention which consisted:

1.  Successful stenting of the ostial Left Main with a 3.5x13mm
Cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] with a 4.5x12mm Quantum MAverick at 16 atms.

Pt remained intubated, tolerated the procedure and transfered
back to the SICU in stable condition

On [**3-25**] pt experienced new onset A-Fib. Pt was treated
aggressively, the A-Fib has resolved. Pt extubated the same day.

Pt remained in the SICU untill [**2128-4-1**]. During this time frame
he was treated for the variety of ailments mentioned above. On 3
/18 pt transeferd back to the VICU in stable condition.

Pt remianed in the VICU untill [**4-7**], then transfered to the
floor.

Pt screened by PT / Case management. Pt discharged from the
hospital in stable condition.
