Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and cough x 2-3 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2114-2-12**]
Left thoracentesis [**2114-2-6**]

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83 year-old male with H/O hypertension,
diet-controlled type II diabetes mellitus, and renal carcinoma
s/p partial right nephrectomy in [**2111**] who presents with dry
cough and shortness of breath x 2-3 weeks. Per OMR, he was seen
at PCP's office two weeks ago for cough. He was treated with
Augmentin for 10 days, but it is unclear if he took this. In
addition, at that time, he had stopped all of his medications
because he felt he was taking too many. His HR was reported at
113 at that visit- no mention of regular or irregular rhythm. He
was explained the need to continue medications.

On presentation, the patient reported dry cough and shortness of
breath x 2-3 weeks with worsening over 1 day PTA. He denied
coughing anything up, but another note in OMR said he had been
productive of yellow sputum. Per his family, he has had a
chronic non-productive cough for several years, but this has
been worsening over the past month. The patient denies fevers,
chills. He reports palpitations, nausea when coughing a lot,
wheezing (unclear for how long or whether he has a history of
wheezing), decreased appetite, swelling in legs, orthopnea.
There was no chest pain or pleuritic chest pain, vomiting,
diarrhea, myalgias, fatigue.  He is unsure about weight loss.

In the ED, his vitals were T 94.5, BP 139/83, HR 125, RR 24, O2
sat 94% on RA. He was noted to be in ? SVT v. atrial flutter v.
atrial fibrillation seen on multiple EKGs. He was given
diltiazem 10 mg IV x2 and then diltiazem 30 mg PO  x1. He
continued to have rapid ventricular rate and was placed on a
diltiazem drip. He was also given Levoquin and ASA. Per ED
notes, he had a bedside ultrasound placed on the heart which
showed no effusion, but uncoordinated atrial activity.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.  Cardiac review of systems is notable
for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope
or presyncope.

ECG [**2114-2-2**]  5:35:56 PM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 123 bpm.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Intraventricular conduction defect. Borderline voltage criteria
for left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes may be
related to left ventricular hypertrophy/rate or rhythm. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2110-10-13**] atrial fibrillation is new.

[**2114-2-2**] CXR
Respiratory motion compromises the study. There is a massive
cardiomegaly again identified. There is a tortuous aorta.
Pulmonary vascularity is indistinct which may be in part due to
respiratory motion, although mild element of underlying edema
cannot be excluded. Increased density is noted in both lung
bases, particularly in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. There
is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm. No definite right
effusion is seen. There is no large underlying pneumothorax. A
levoconcave curvature of the thoracic spine is again identified.

[**2114-2-3**] CXR (PA & lat):
Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate severe
cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions left greater
than right and pulmonary vascular redistribution suggesting mild
failure. There is no definite infiltrate.

CXR ([**2114-2-5**]): Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, worsening
upper zone vascular redistribution.  Bilateral pleural effusions
also appear slightly larger.

ECHO ([**2114-2-5**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%) with severe
hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and moderate
hypokinesis of the remaining segments. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures.

ECHO ([**2114-2-6**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic function
appears depressed with inferior akinesis, inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere (LV ejection
fraction ?35%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The pericardium appears thickened. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

ECHO ([**2114-2-9**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS ([**2114-2-6**]):
No evidence of acute DVT.  Equivocal findings in the left
superficial femoral and popliteal veins as described above for
which short interval followup in 48 hours is recommended.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS ([**2114-2-8**]): No evidence of lower
extremity DVT.

CYTOLOGY:
[**2-6**] pleural fluid: 1+ PMLs, G stain/ culture neg, cytology neg
for malignant cells

CARDIAC CATH [**2114-2-12**]:  (preliminary results)
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
flow limiting disease in one coronary artery and mild,
non-obstructive diseaese of 2 other coronary arteries.  The LMCA
had mild plaquing.  The LAD had mild luminal irregularities with
a 30% stenosis in a diffusely diseased D1 branch.  The LCx had a
30% mid vessel stenosis.  The RCA had an 80% distal stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided and
elevated left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 9 mm Hg and
LVEDP of 20 mm Hg. PA systolic pressure was normal at 28 mm Hg.
Mean PCWP was top normal at 12 mm Hg. Systemic arterial
pressures were normal with aortic systolic pressure of 116 mm
Hg.  Cardiac index was depressed at 1.93 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation and
LVEF=25% with global hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 83 year-old male with hypertension, type II
diabetes mellitus (diet-controlled), and renal carcinoma s/p
right partial nephrectomy in [**2111**] presenting with new atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cough/dyspnea.
The patient's symptoms initially were thought to be
multifactorial with bronchitis (given quality of cough and upper
airway wheezing without fever or leukocytosis), COPD (given
extensive smoking history and history of prior cough), and
diastolic heart failure due to atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate. Pneumonia was also considered initially given
LLL rales. The patient was started on azithromycin/ ceftriaxone/
and vancomycin (given + blood culture on day of admission) for
broad coverage. The patient was also placed on respiratory
precautions given concern for TB. On [**2-5**], the patient was found
to have acute worsening of respiratory status with tachypnea,
significant wheezing, and desaturations to 80%'s despite being
on a non-rebreather. He was transferred to the ICU for further
evaluation.

Brief MICU course: Upon arrival to the ICU, echo results
returned showing moderate LV systolic dysfunction with severe
inferolateral hypokinesis and EF 30-35% (EF 55% in [**2110**]), 4+
mitral regurgitation, elevated right-sided pressures, and mild
LVH. A moderate sized echodense pericardial effusion was noted,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements,
with no evidence of tamponade. The patient underwent diagnostic
L thoracentesis, which showed transudative properties with
cultures and cytology negative. The patient was effectively
diuresed 3 liters during MICU stay with dramatic improvement in
SOB. He was then transferred back to the floor. Remainder of
hospital course is by problem, as follows:

# Cough/ SOB: As above, the patient was initially started on
antibiotics to cover for a possible bronchitis/ pneumonia. He
completed a course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for this.
(Vancomycin was d/c'd as GPC were felt to be contamination.) He
completed a course of prednisone x 3 days and was started on
Advair with prn levalbuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for
potential COPD component. The patient was screened for
tuberculosis with negative AFB smears x 3. Bilateral LENIs were
negative for DVTs. Once echo results returned, SOB and cough
were felt to be most likely cardiac in origin with acute
systolic and diastolic dysfunction and decompensated valvular
disease contributing. The  patient was effectively diuresed
approximately >6 L over his hospital course with resolution of
symptoms and no further oxygen requirement. Upon discharge, the
patient was continued on cardiac medications, as below, as well
as Advair inhaler.

# CAD: The patient had no known CAD on admission. There was no
evidence of MI with negative cardiac biomarkers x 3 and no ST-T
wave changes suggestive of ischemia. On [**2-12**] catheterization,
the patient was found to have evidence of 1 vessel disease in
the RCA as well as diffuse plaquing. There were no interventions
done during catheterization, and there were no current
indications for CABG. The patient was continued on medical
management with ASA, ACE-I, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.

# Rhythm: The patient presented with newly diagnosed atrial
fibrillation on this admission. Etiology was felt to be due to
severe systolic as well as diastolic dysfunction and
decompensated valvular disease. The patient was started on
several agents for HR control, which were uptitrated to the
following regimen with HR in mostly 60s-70s: metoprolol XL 300
mg daily, diltiazem SR 120 mg daily (added for rate control
despite the severe LV systolic heart failure), and digoxin
(therapeutic at 0.9 on discharge). He was continued on a heparin
drip for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; however, upon
discharge decision was made not to pursue Coumadin therapy as
patient was felt to be a poor candidate due to history of
medication noncompliance.

# Congestive heart failure, acute, systolic and diastolic, EF
25%: As mentioned above, the patient was found to have [**3-6**]+
mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, elevated R-sided
pressures, and systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the basal inferolateral wall and moderate hypokinesis of the
remaining segments with EF 35% on [**2-5**] echo. Cath confirmed
severe systolic LV dysfunction (global HK), mild diastolic
biventricular dysfunction, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and LVEF
25%. The patient was aggressively diuresed, as above, and was
discharged on standing dose of Lasix. He was continued on
beta-blocker, ACE-I, and CCB for BP and HR control. He was set
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] for further managment of heart failure as an
outpatient.

# Hypertension: The patient presented with hypertension to
160s/90s, which improved with diuresis, ACE-I, and uptitration
of metoprolol and diltiazem. BPs upon discharge were
100s-120s/50s-60s.

# Decompensated Mitral Valve Disease: [**2-5**] echo revealed 4+
mitral regurgitation of unclear etiology. The patient was
treated medically while in house with resolution of symptoms. No
plan was made for MV repair given that the patient was
asymptomatic; however, MVR may be an option in the future if
medical management fails.

# Pericardial effusion: The patient presented with an enlarged
cardiac silhouette on admission CXR, with 2/4 echo revealing
moderate sized effusion with mixed echogenic material. Effusion
was of unclear etiology - inflmammation vs infection vs
malignancy vs hemorrhagic. There were no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade, no pulsus paradoxus on exam, and no evidence of
tamponade on catheterization. There was no change in effusion
size on serial echos. Decision was made not to perform
pericardiocentesis as effusion seemed stable and the patient was
asymptomatic. Malignant etiology of effusion was considered;
however, this is less likely as pleural effusion analysis had
negative cytology.

# Ophthalomology: The patient was blind in left eye (does not
know etiology of this), and right eye had conjunctival injection
on admission. Per the patient, injection was secondary to not
using prednisiolone acetate 1% eye drops. Ophtalmology was
consulted, and they recommended to use prednisilone acetate 1%
in R eye QD to prevent rejection of corneal implant.

# Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient has a history of RCC s/p
right partial nephrectomy in [**2111**]. Creatinine remained stable
throughout hospital course, near baseline of 1.0-1.2. The
patient is followed by urology as an outpatient with no acute
issues. As above, pleural effusion cytology was negative for
malignant cells.

# Hematuria: The patient had brief episode of hematuria upon
removal of Foley catheter, likely secondary to Foley trauma. He
was briefly kept on CBI with subsequent resolution of hematuria.

# DMII: The patient has a history of diet-controlled DM, with
recent HbA1c of 5.8%. He was continued on an ISS while inhouse,
but demonstrated good glycemic control on a diabetic diet. He
was discharged with a glucometer to check finger sticks
regularly.

# BPH: The patient was continued on outpatient finasteride.
Doxazosin was held due to low BP.

# Code: FULL (confirmed with patient and HCP - [**Name (NI) 20806**].
