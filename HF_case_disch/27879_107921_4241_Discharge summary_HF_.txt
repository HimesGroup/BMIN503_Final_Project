Reason: pna /plueral [**Hospital 18440**]

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CHEST RADIOGRAPH
INDICATION: Oxygen requirement, rule out of pneumonia and
pleural effusion.
COMPARISON: [**2149-4-4**]. As compared to the previous
radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. Due to the
increased lung volumes, band-like opacities in both lung bases
are better seen than on the previous radiograph. These opacities
could correspond to plate-like atelectasis, old post- infectious
scars or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The remaining
differential diagnosis could be further worked up by CT. There
is unchanged subtle blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
suggestive of either a small pleural scar or a small pleural
effusion. No newly occurred opacities. No evidence of
hyperhydration or cardiac failure. The size of the cardiac
silhouette is slightly above the normal range.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic
valve leaflets. Systolic doming of aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS (AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2) Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is systolic doming of the aortic
valve leaflets. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
There is trace perivalvular AI. MR remains mild. The study is
otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was a direct admission to the operating room on [**2149-4-1**]
where she underwent an AVR, please see OR report for details. In
summary she had AVR with 21mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic valve, her bypass
time was 102 min with cross clamp of 75 minutes. She tolerated
the operation well and was transferred to the ICU in critical
but stable condition. She was extubated on the morning of POD #1
and later in the day was transferred to the floor. Once on the
floors she had an uneventful post-operative course. Her chest
tubes were removed late on POD1 and epicardial wires were
removed on POD3. Her activity was advanced by nursing and PT. On
POD4 she was transfused with PRBC's for a HCT of 22. her HCT
stayed stable over the next 2 days and on POD6 she was
transferred to rehabilitation at Lifecare of [**Location (un) 5165**].
