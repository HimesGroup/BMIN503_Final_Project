History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old man with severe CHF (EF <20%), HTN, DM
2 presenting with increasing shortness of breath and pedal edema
for the past 7 days.   Family reports that he stopped taking all
of his medications approximately 5 days PTA because he could no
longer taste anything and was concerned that one of his meds was
causing this.  He came to the ED because he could no longer walk

sleep sitting straight up.  In addition he reported a dry cough
productive of grey sputum, lightheadedness/dizziness.  He denied
fever and chest pain.

OTHER TESTING:
CXR [**2165-10-6**]-
1.  Slight perimediastinal vascular haze, increased interstitial
markings, and bilateral lower lung field haze, all suggestive of
mild fluid overload with probable layering posterior effusion.
2.  Left lower lobe/retrocardiac density is nonspecific and may
represent underlying atelectasis or consolidation
.
TTE [**2165-10-7**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the  left ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe  global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally  normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal  with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary artery  systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-12-10**],
the findings  are similar (left ventricular dysfunction was also
global on review of the  prior study and right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis was also present.  Borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension is now suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea/CHF: The patient's worsened dyspnea was thought to be
due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of medication
non-compliance and pneumonia. Upon arrival to the CCU, the
patient was exhibiting [**Last Name (un) 6055**] [**Doctor Last Name **] respirations, and due to
somnolence and increasing hypercapnia required intubation. A PA
catheter was placed, and he was started on dobutamine, and
responded well to diuresis with lasix and diuril. He was
extubated on [**10-7**], and his respiratory status improved with
continued diuresis. He will be discharged on lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] as he
remains volume overloaded; diuretics will be titrated at his
followup heart failure clinic visit in the next week. He
continued his home beta blocker and ACEI. Spironolactone was
started, and he will continue this as an outpatient. His
electrolytes and renal function should be reassessed at his next
clinic visit on [**2165-9-14**].
.
2. MAT/Tachycardia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a run of tachycardia to the
150's in the ED that responded well to lopressor by report. On
the floor, he continued to have brief episodes of NSVT and PVCs
on telemetry.
.
3. CAD: Patient continued on aspirin, betablocker, statin, and
ACEI.
.
4. Pneumonia: The patient was initially treated with
azithromycin and ceftriaxone and in the ED, subsequently on
levofloxacin and flagyl. He will complete a 7d course of
levofloxacin to end on [**2165-9-12**].
.
5. Diabetes: The patient was treated with insulin while in the
CCU, with resumption of his metformin subsequently. Given his
baseline elevated creatinine, an alternative oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] than
metformin may be preferable. This can be readdressed at his next
outpatient followup appointment.
.
5. Sleep apnea: CPAP continued
.
6. Traumatic foley insertion:  Urology was consulted for
hematuria, per urology balloon inflated in the prostatic fossa,
foley repositioned and irrigated with good urine output and
resolution of hematuria.
