Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11552**]
Chief Complaint:
RLE edema, erythema


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunnelled Dialysis Catheter Placement


History of Present Illness:
61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ PMH significant for type 1 IDDM
(s/p revision renal and pancreas transplants, [**2160**] and [**2174**]),
diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E coli UTIs,
chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated hyperkalemia,
and h/o recurrent fevers and infections presents with right
lower extremity swelling and redness x 3 days, associated with
temp to 99.4 w/ chills last night. These symptoms were present
at a hospital admission on [**11-5**] and resolved spontaneously
while the patient was on antibiotics (meropenem). She was
switched to ceftazidime with dialysis as an outpatient for gram
negative bacteremia.  The patient states that she was doing well
at rehab until the end of last week, when she experienced
increasing edema and erythema of her RLE.  Symptoms worsened
until 1 day PTA, when the patient experienced subjective fever
and chills.

In the ED, VSS.  The patient was found to have right LE w/ 1+
pitting edema, erythema, and warmth, no open wounds or lesions.
Lower extremity duplex showed non-occlusive thrombus in the R.
popliteal vein.  She was started on a heparin drip 1000u/hr,
without bolus.  The patient also received 1 dose of IV
vancomycin for presumed cellulitis.

On the floor, the patient currently feels well.  She believes
that erythema is improved from 2 days PTA.  No fevers/chills,
SOB, pleuritic chest pain, cough.  Patient does endorse several
weeks of diarrhea since starting ceftazidime.  She began a
course of loperimide in rehab that resulted in improvement in
the frequency of her diarrhea, although stools are still loose.

Reports:
CXR [**2181-11-24**]
1. Interval placement of a right internal jugular dialysis
catheter, which has its tip in the right atrium and is in
similar position to that on prior study dated [**2181-11-6**].
2. The previously seen left effusion has decreased in size.
There is a
diffuse bilateral interstitial process, which likely reflects a
component of mild pulmonary edema. The heart remains borderline
enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

CXR [**2181-11-25**]
1. Right internal jugular dialysis catheter again having its tip
within the right atrium in similar position as compared to
multiple prior studies. There is increasing bibasilar and
perihilar airspace opacities, which likely reflect worsening
moderate pulmonary edema. There are likely layering effusions,
left greater than right. Diffuse pneumonia would be less likely
given the rapidity of interval change. No pneumothorax is seen.
Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with
the heart being stably enlarged.
.
CXR [**2181-11-25**] afternoon
Moderately severe pulmonary edema has not worsened since earlier
in the day, though moderate right and small left pleural
effusions have increased. Moderate cardiomegaly has remained
stable over the past several days, but has progressed
substantially since [**Month (only) 359**] and could be due to cardiomegaly
and/or pericardial effusion. Dual-channel catheter, presumably
for hemodialysis ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax.

CXR [**2181-11-28**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-27**],
there is continued diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
consistent with worsening effusions, volume loss, and increased
pulmonary vascular congestion. Possibility of supervening
pneumonia must be seriously considered in the appropriate
clinical setting, though this is difficult to evaluate in view
of the substrate of extensive pulmonary changes.

CXR [**2181-11-30**]: Previous severe pulmonary edema has cleared with
residual moderate right and small left pleural effusion. Heart
size is normal. Could be substantial right lower lobe
atelectasis. Followup advised. No pneumothorax.Dual-channel
right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends low in the right
atrium

Video Swallow [**2181-11-30**]: IMPRESSION: No gross aspiration or
penetration seen. Delayed passage of 13-mm tablet at the lower
esophageal sphincter. For full details, please refer to the
speech and swallow note in OMR.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 61 yo F with PMH type 1 IDDM (s/p revision renal
and pancreas transplants, [**2160**] and [**2174**]), chronic diastolic and
systolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E coli UTIs,
on dialysis for refractory hyperkalemia, initially presented
with right lower extremity cellulitis s/p completed course of
Vancomycin, sent to MICU for tachycardia, fevers, and
respiratory distress requiring biPAP. She responded well to
broad spectrum antibiotics and HD/ultrafiltration for fluid
overload and transfered afebrile on room air.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Low grade fevers:  After being on the floor for treatment of
right lower extremity DVT versus cellulitis (see below), she
developed low grade fevers and tachycardia.  She was transferred
to the ICU for further management of suspected pneumonia and
evolving sepsis.  Due to her chronic immunosuppression and
suspicious chest xray, her antibiotics were broadened to
daptomycin, meropenem, and atovaquone.  She was fluid
resuscitated judiciously to avoid volume overload given her
heart failure and renal failure.  Beta glucan and galactomannans
were sent and are still pending. Infectious disease consulted
and felt this was not likely infectious process and antibiotics
were narrowed to Meropenem for 7 day course, completed on
[**2181-12-2**]
.
# Respiratory distress: On floor patient developed progressive
worsening respiratory status with increased work of breathing
and developed hypoxia with exertion. Respiratory status
initially improved with ultrafiltration but then she
deteriorated exhibiting posturing, accessory muscle use and
began tiring out and so she was transferred to MICU. Prior to
transfer she was given 60mg IV Lasix x2 and started on braod
spectrum antibiotics for HCAP coverage without improvement in
her symptoms. While in the ICU, the patient was continued on
antibiotics for possible pneumonia, but CXRs were more
consistent with volume overload.  The patient's oxygen
requirement increased in the unit, and she was using BIPAP.  She
then underwent HD, which she tolerated very well.  Post HD, the
patient's oxygen requirment dropped, and she was initially
stable on 2-4L NC, and on transfer out of the unit, she was
stable on RA.  The patient was also being followed by ID in the
unit and her antibiotic coverage was reduced to vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**], as
atovaquone and dapto were discontinued.  As per ID recs, the
Vanc was discontinued on D10 of treatment, and her [**Last Name (un) **] was
continued.  Of note, the patient has a history sleep disordered
breathing and has been tried on CPAP at home. She was called out
to the floor with CPAP settings for overnight.
.
# Tachycardia:  The patient became tachycardic, with rhythm in
atrial fibrillation vs. atrial flutter.  The patient's pressure
dropped into the 80s systolic during this episode of
tachycardia, likely because of inadequate time for diastolic
filling.  Amiodarone drip was started (1.0 mg/[**Last Name (un) **] for 6 hours,
0.5 mg/[**Last Name (un) **] for 18 hours), and then she was maintained on 200 mg
PO daily.  After starting the amiodarone, the patient's heart
rates were better controlled and she remained hemodynamically
stable. Coumadin was started and continued for atrial
fibrillation anticoagulation.

# Right lower extremity suspected deep veinous thrombosis:
Patient admitted with right non-occlusive popliteal DVT and was
started on warfarin. However, the final read of her LENIs found
that there was no DVT, and her warfarin was stopped after she
had some episodes of hemoptysis in the ICU. She remained
hemodynamically stable, with minimal pain, and no evidence of
pulmonary embolism. Hemoptysis resolved.
.
# Lower extremity erythema: Erythema marked on admission,
thought to be due to DVT initially but then as above more likely
isolated cellulitis. Cellulitis improved on Vancomycin however
she continued to have fevers so was changed to daptomycin when
she was transferred to the ICU. Erythema and swelling resolved
with completion of antibiotics and hemodialysis to remove volume
overload.
.
# Recent Hx E. Coli bacteremia: Patient discharged in [**10-2**] for
E. Coli bacteremia, s/p inpatient course of IV meropenem. She
was discharged on ceftazidime with HD, and completed a course.
Due to ongoing fevers and concern for pneumonia, was restarted
on meropenem. Meropenem completed as above.
.
# End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD):  Patient
is s/p renal transplant x2, complicated by acute kidney injury
on recent admission.  She has since been on HD on monday,
wednesday, friday schedule.  She remains on tacrolimus,
sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression. The patient last
received inhaled pentamidine on [**10-4**] for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Continued her HD schedule MWF. Sevalamer increased to 2400 PO
TID with meals. Immunosuppression was titrated to sirolimus 2mg
Daily, prednisone 5 mg Daily and Tacro 3mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Diarrhea - Patient has had diarrhea while taking ceftazidime.
Stool cultures on last admission negative.  Started on
loperimide at rehab and diarrhea improved to 2 loose stools
daily.  C.Diff negative, fecal cultures negative during this
admission. Diarrhea resolved after completion of ceftazidime
.
# Peripheral neuropathy of amputation: Chronic. Intermittently
symptomatic. Continued gabapentin 300mg po q48hrs PRN (renally
dosed).
.
# Coronary artery disease and chronic systolic/diastolic heart
failure (CAD/CHF): Echo [**2181-11-7**] with moderately dilated left
ventricular cavity with moderate global hypokinesis, especially
the anterior wall and septum, severe mitral regurgitation, and
small ASD/stretched PFO present with left to right shunting at
rest. Continued atorvastatin 80mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily,
Clopidogrel 75mg daily. ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] not started given her worsening
end stage renal disease.
.
# Type 1 diabetes mellitus: Resolved status post pancreatic
transplant and did not require insulin while inpatient.
.
# Glaucoma - Chronic, Stable, continued eyedrops
.
# Hypothyroid - Chronic, Stable, continued levothyroxine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Reevaluate anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation
- Monitor INR
- Check Tacro levels and titrate accordingly
- CPAP at night, patient may require formal sleep study
- BCx no growth to date x1 but not final on discharge
- Monitor Tacro and [**Last Name (un) 1380**] levels
- Outpatient HD schedule should be established

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17759**],

It was a pleasure treating you during this hospitalization. You
were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with Right
Lower Extremity Edema and Reddness. You were though to have a
DVT in your right leg and also cellulitis of your right leg. You
were treated with Heparin and bridged to Coumadin for
anticoagulation, you had no evidence of developing pulmonary
embolus. On further evaluation the final read of the ultrasound
did not show a DVT. The cellulitis was treated with IV
Vancomycin and the erythema resolved. During your admission you
became progressively ill with the concern for a hospital
acquired infection. You were treated with IV Daptomycin and
Meropenem for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. In addition,
you were treated with Pentamidine to prophylax against PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]. You were in the intensive care unit for some time
where a CPAP mask was used to help your breathing. The breathing
difficulty was thought to be related to too much fluid in your
lung rather than an infection. After the fluid was removed your
breathing improved and antibiotics completed. You are being
discharged in improved condition from admission with
instructions to continue wearing a CPAP mask at night.

The following changes to your medications were made:
- START Coumadin 3mg Daily for atrial fibrillation
- Increase Sevelamer to 2400 mg three times a day W/MEALS
- START Amiodarone 200 mg PO DAILY
- CHANGE Tacrolimus to 2 mg twice daily
- CHANGE Sirolimus to 1.5 mg DAILY

Other Instructions:
- Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
- Continue CPAP mask at night: Autoset [**5-11**]
- Test for consideration post-discharge: Homocysteine
