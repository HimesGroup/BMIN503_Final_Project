History of Present Illness:
73yoW with history CHF, hypertension, hypothyroidism,
hyperlipidemia, multiple PEs, and type II diabetes mellitus
complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and renal failure who
was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with worsening renal
function and need for hemodialysis.  She was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital [**2115-2-4**], treated for a CHF exacerbation, and discharged
to home.  She was again admitted [**2115-2-11**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital
with complaints of neck pain, abdominal discomfort, and nausea.
Neck pain was diagnosed as muscle spasm, treated with flexeril,
and improved.  Hospital course, however, has been complicated by
worsening renal function with elevated creatinine and BUN.
Creatinine on admission was 4.1, and rose to 6.1 during her
hospitalization.  She was treated with gentle iv fluids, but
became fluid overloaded and required diuresis with lasix.  MRA
of the kidneys at [**Location (un) **] also showed bilateral 30% renal artery
stenosis.
.
During her hospital course she was treated for a UTI with a
single dose of iv levofloxacin.  Urine culture grew only mixed
flora.  Nausea was treated with Protonix and Reglan as there was
concern for gastroparesis.  She was to have a swallow evaluation
but this was not done prior to transfer.  During her previous
hospitalization, she had ruled out for MI.  She was to have a
cardiac cath, but this was postponed in the setting of worsening
renal function.  She had a perfusion imaging stress [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2115-2-6**]
that showed posterior and anteroseptal ischemia with mild LV
dilation and normal EF.  V/Q scan [**2-11**] was high probability for
PE, despite being anticoagulated on coumadin.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] she complains of
dizziness/lightheadedness, occasional chills, back pain and
constipation.  She denies fevers, sweats, visual changes, chest
pain, palpitations, SOB, cough, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, arthralgias, myalgias,
and skin changes.

AV FITULOGRAM SCH

Reason: evaluate fistula patency
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with ESRD, left AV fistula
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate fistula patency
HISTORY: 73-year-old female with end-stage renal disease and
left upper extremity AV fistula with poor flows at hemodialysis.

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name 19595**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 19595**], the
staff radiologist, was present and supervising throughout. After
the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
placed supine on the angiography table. Her left upper extremity
was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A
physical examination was performed, revealing a palpable thrill
throughout the native fistula. Through an anesthetized skin
approach, the fistula was accessed in the outflow direction
using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. A 0.018 guide wire was
advanced through the access needle into the outflow cephalic
vein under fluoroscopic visualization. The skin entry site was
incised with a #11 blade scalpel. The access needle was replaced
with a 4-French micropuncture dilator.

After the guide wire was removed, a fistulogram was performed
via injection of nonionic contrast. This revealed a patent and
large outflow cephalic vein with no evidence of thrombus,
stenosis, or occlusion. There is antegrade opacification of the
left brachial vein via a few small collateral branches from the
outflow cephalic vein at the level of the mid-arm. Further
imaging reveals free passage of contrast from the outflow
cephalic vein into the left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins
along with the superior vena cava and right heart with no
evidence of central stenosis or occlusion. After a blood
pressure cuff was inflated, a repeat injection was performed to
evaluate the arterial inflow. This revealed a mild stenosis at
the brachial artery- cephalic vein anastomosis. However, there
is antegrade flow into the brachial artery distal to the
anastomosis, with brisk flow throughout the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this is
likely insignificant. Following the procedure, the micropuncture
sheath was removed from the fistula and manual pressure was held
until hemostasis was achieved. A dry sterile dressing was
applied.

COMPLICATIONS: None.

MEDICATIONS: 1% lidocaine.

CONTRAST: 75 cc of full-strength Optiray 320.

IMPRESSION: Left upper extremity fistulogram revealed a patent
native brachiocephalic fistula with good inflow and no evidence
of thrombosis, obstruction, or stenosis within the outflow
cephalic vein, subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein and
superior vena cava with free passage of contrast into the right
heart. A mild stenosis is present at the arterial anastomosis.
However, given the brisk flow present, this is likely
insignificant.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2115-3-14**] 3:40 PM

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN; DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED

Reason: patient needs RUQ to evaluate cause of elevated
transaminase

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with arf on hd, tamponade s/p drain, afib rvr
now nsr, with acutely increasing transaminases
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
patient needs RUQ to evaluate cause of elevated transaminases-
?masses, obstruction to flow etc.
STUDY: Ultrasound of abdomen.

INDICATION: Acute elevation of transaminase.

TECHNIQUE: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale imaging of the abdomen was performed.

COMPARISON: Reference is made to CT examination from [**2115-2-24**].

REPORT: There are areas of heterogeneous echo texture. This
raises the possibility of underlying cirrhosis. Correlation with
history may be appropriate.

The ---------- veins, portal veins are clearly visualized and
are patent.

Bilateral pleural effusions likely reflect the patient's known
chronic renal disease.

There is enlargement of the gallbladder to 12 cm. A small
dependent gallstone previously identified on CT is not now
appreciated. The gallbladder distention was probably previous
present. There is no evidence of localized tenderness.

There is in addition extensive dilatation of the extrahepatic
biliary system, with lesser dilatation of the intrahepatic
biliary system. The common hepatic duct and bile duct measures
up to 1.6 cm. The area of the head of the pancreas and
periampullary area is poorly visualized due to overlying gas,
but there is a suggestion of a focal hypoechoic area within the
head of the pancreas that raises the possibility of a small
periampullary or pancreatic neoplasm. This should be correlated
with ERCP.

The right kidney measures 9.5 cm. It is slightly reduced in
size. The left kidney measures 11.3 cm. Again mild cortical
thinning is seen in both kidneys, but there is good preservation
of corticomedullary differentiation.

The spleen measures 7.3 cm. No overt evidence of ascites.

CONCLUSION:

Appearances are consistent with a Courvoisier gallbladder.
Correlation with ERCP examination is recommended.

 INDICATION:  Elevated transaminases and dilated gallbladder.
Enlarged CBD and
suspicion of pancreatic mass.

TECHNIQUE:
Only noncontrast-enhanced images were obtained including
multiplanar T1- and
T2-weighted sequences.  The patient was unable to complete the
examination for
the contrast-enhanced dynamic portion of the exam.

FINDINGS:
The biliary tract is markedly dilated with the common bile duct
that measures
1.6 cm in diameter.  It shows a smooth tapering, but rather
abrupt in its
transition from dilatation to its insertion in the duodenum.
There is no
pancreatic mass visualized on these noncontrast-enhanced images.
 The
pancreatic duct is not significantly dilated nor were there side
branches
visualized.  The gallbladder is distended, but there is no wall
thickening and
no definite evidence for gallstones.

The pancreatic parenchyma is diffusely atrophic, but the remnant
tissue shows
normal signal intensity on the noncontrast enhanced fat
suppressed T1-weighted
images.  The liver shows no evidence of space-occupying lesion.
The kidneys
show no evidence of hydronephrosis and diminished
corticomedullary contrast,
consistent with an element of medical renal disease.  The
adrenal glands and
spleen are unremarkable.  A small hepatic cyst was seen in
segment II of the
liver.

There is a small amount of perihepatic ascites and evidence of
third spacing
of fluid with subcutaneous edema and large bilateral pleural
effusions.

IMPRESSION:
Study limited by the patient's inability to complete the
contrast-enhanced
portion of the study.

Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with
transition point
at the level of the ampulla - no pancreatic mass visualized.
ERCP is
recommended to evaluate for a distal CBD stricture or ampullary
lesion.

No choledocholithiasis.  Distended gallbladder without evidence
of
inflammation.

Third spacing of fluids


Brief Hospital Course:
73yoW with history of diastolic CHF, hypertension,
hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, multiple pulmonary embolisms,
and type II diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy,
neuropathy, and renal failure who was transferred from [**Hospital **]
Hospital with worsening renal function and a questionable need
for hemodialysis.  During her hospitalization the following
problems were addressed:

1.  Renal failure:  Patient presented with acute on chronic
renal insuffiency with associated metabolic acidosis.  She had
been moving toward hemodialysis with worsening renal function
associated with diabetes and had had an A-V fistula placed in
the left arm in [**8-27**] in anticipation of the need for dialysis.
Her acute worsening was thought to be due to prerenal azotemia
and ATN associated with treatment for her CHF exacerbation.  The
A-v fistula had not matured and was inaccessable.  Initiation of
hemodialysis, was complicated, then, by the patient's presenting
coagulopathy (see discussion below for details) which precluded
placement of a dialysis catheter.  On day 3 of her admission she
developed chest pain.  There were no ECG changes, and she was
ruled out for acute MI by cardiac enzymes.  On day 4, she again
developed chest pain, this time with upsloping ST-elevations in
leads I, aVL, II, III, aVF, and V4-V6.  A cardiology consult was
called emergently.  Cardiology felt the findings were more
consistent with pericarditis due to her worsening uremia.  At
the same time she became acutely hypotensive to 78/D, with a
5point Hct drop, and was transferred to the MICU.  There a
temporary left groin Quentin catheter was placed, and
hemodialysis initiated.  She was transferred back to the floor
on day 5, and was dialyzed for three days in a row.  She then
assumed regular Mon,Wed,Fri dialysis schedule.  The signs of
uremia including metabolic acidosis, nausea/vomiting, and
pericarditis resolved.  A temporary right subclavian line was
placed for dialysis by the interventional radiology team.  Once
her coagulopathy resolved completely, this line was tunnelled on
[**2115-2-28**].  A transplant surgery consult was also obtained to
further evaluate the failed Av fistula.  She also  had
intermittent problems with blue/cold left hand.  As per
transplant, this may be secondary to steal phenomenon
(complication of AV fistula). In addition, fistulogram was done
to determine if there was some central stenosis that may have
been the reason the [**Date Range **] did not mature. Fistulogram was done
that showed a mild stenosis  present at the arterial
anastomosis. However, given the brisk flow present, this is
likely insignificant. Transplant surgery felt that althought
there was likely a small component of steal phenomonen, unless
the patient developed hand numbness, nothing should be done at
this point. Patient will follow up with transplant surgery and
if numbness develops then the fistula may need to be tied off.
 .

2.  Coagulopathy:   The patient has a history of two prior
pulmonary embolisms and multiple DVTs.  She had been on coumadin
for more than 20yrs.  Despite being on coumadin, she was
diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism by high probability V/Q scan
during her hospitalization at [**Hospital **] Hospital, prior to
transfer.  On initial labs following transfer, the patient's INR
was 78, PTT 58.  The assays were repeated, and the INR was still
38.  She was treated emergently with 1mg iv vitamin K and 2units
FFP.  By day two the INR was 3.8. A hematology consult was
obtained.  It was felt the elevated INR was likely due to
non-monitoring of coumadin dosing in the setting of concurrent
antibiotic use.  She was not deemed a \"coumadin failure,\" but it
was recommended that after her acute renal issues resolve, and
she has adequate access for dialysis, that coumadin be restarted
with a goal INR of 3.  The was treated with 8units of FFP over
the first 3 days of admission in effort to lower her INR to a
level at which she could have a tunnelled dialysis line placed.
On day 5, after return from the MICU, she vomited gastroccult
positive emesis.  As her INR had come down, she had been placed
on a heparin gtt overnight, and her PTT was supratherapeutic.
Hematocrit remained stable (with baseline 28-32).  The heparin
was discontinued; however, she still had a guiaic positive stool
on day 6.  Given the need for anticoagulation in the setting of
pulmonary embolism diagnosed during her previous hospitalization
at [**Hospital **] Hospital by V/Q scan, we determined it would be
better to place an IVC filter, and let the coagulation factors
correct.  She was also treated with 10mg SC vitamin K at the
time guiaic positive stools were noted. INR at this time as
still around 3.  An IVC filter was placed [**2115-2-25**] by
interventional radiology.  The INR and PTT normalized, and after
the tunnelled line placement [**2115-2-28**], she was then restarted on
heparin with a plan to bridge to coumadin. However patients INR
rose to 3.9, with albumin of 2.7 and she was thought to be
likely nutritionally deficient, and nutrition consult was
obtained (heparin was also stopped). Patients INR then came down
to 2.7 and she was started on a low dose of coumadin (INR goal
of 3).

3.  Pulmonary embolism:  diagnosed by V/Q scan at the outside
hospital.  she was anticoagulated as described above.  An IVC
filter was also placed [**2115-2-25**] by interventional radiology. Her
heparin was stopped around time of pericardiocentesis (see
below) and restarted after drain was removed.  Coumadin was not
restarted in the event that she may need fistulogram or other
procedure.

4.  Pericarditis:  developed on day [**Street Address(2) 19596**]-elevations
on ECG.  this was felt to be a complication of her uremia, and
corrected with dialysis.

5.  Metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap.  this was
thought to be due to uremia, and resolved with initiation of
dialysis

6.  Type II diabetes mellitus:  previously the patient had been
on a 70/30 regimen.  This was held in light of her being on and
off NPO status for various procedures.  She was monitored with
qid fingersticks, and treated with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  As her po intake was still limited prior to discharge,
she was discharged on the sliding scale, with plans to resume
her 70/30 insulin regimen when her intake/nutrition improved.

7.  Cardiovascular disease:  the patient had a positive stress
test p-MIBI at the outside hospital indicating coronary artery
disease.  Cardiac catheterization was not felt to be urgent, and
was deferred until her renal status could be established.
Cardiology consult at [**Hospital1 18**] did not feel catheterization was an
urgent matter.  She was continued on metoprolol, statin, aspirin
during her hospitalization for secondary prevention.
Additionally, once her renal status was stable, she was restared
on her [**Last Name (un) **], diovan, prior to discharge.  She will follow-up with
her primary care provider and Cardiologist to arrange for
outpatient cardiac catheterization.  Echocardiogram done during
this hospitalization showed a reduced EF of 40%, global
hypokinesis, trace AR, mild AS, mild MR.  She had had a normal
EF of 55% on echo at outside hospital and was believed to have
diastolic dysfunction.  Based on the ech findings at [**Hospital1 18**] it
was thought she has a combined systolic/diastolic conjestive
heart failure.  At time of pericardiocentesis, she had a cardiac
catheterization which showed clean coronaries.  She was started
on Valsartan as well for her heart failure while in the CCU, and
her ASA, BB< Zocor were continued.

8.  Hypotension:  On day 4, [**2115-2-22**], the patient became acutely
hypotensive to 78/D, irresponsive to fluid boluses of 250-500cc.
 She also had a hematrocrit drop of 5 points.  She was guiaic
negative at that time.  Abdominal CT showed no evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed.  She was transferred to the MICU.  It was
later learned that her blood pressure runs that low at times at
baseline, and this hypotension was thought to be due to
autonomic dysfunction, secondary to her diabetes.  She had no
mental status changes, and blood pressure stabilized.  She was
transferred back to the floor the following day.  The following
week on [**2115-3-2**] she was again noted to be hypotensive with SBP
80s.  She continued to mentate well.  Blood pressure was
minimally responsive to 250 and 500cc boluses.  On [**2115-3-4**]
echocardiogram showed a 1.5-2cm pericardial effusion with
compression of RA diastolic function.  She also was found to
have a pulsus paradox of 15-20mmHg, consistent with tamponade.
Cardiology was reconsulted.  They recommended
pericardiocentesis, but as she was hemodynamically stable, and
had an elevated INR from coumadin being restarted, this was
deferred.  Coumadin was held, INR trended down again, and on
[**3-7**],  pericardiocentesis was done with drainage ot 600 cc
serosanguinous fluid.  Procedure was complicated by puncture of
right ventricle.  CT surgery was consulted and recommended
platelets, FFP, and DDAVP.  The thought was that the RV would be
tamponaded against the diaphragm and by the LV.  Upon transfer
to the CCU, there was virtually no drainage from the pericardial
drain (drainage completely stopped within 2-3 hours of returning
from cath lab).  The drain was removed on [**3-8**], and TTE post
removal did not show reaccumulation of fluid.  She received 1 U
PRBC after procedure, and her hematocrit remained stable.

9.  Atrial fibrillation:  On day 8 of her hospitalization, the
patient was noted to be tachycardic.  ECG showed that she was in
atrial fibrillation.  As anticoagulation status was
questionable, it was felt she would benefit from a rate control
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] over cardioversion.  Her metoprolol dose was increased
from 12.5 to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  She converted back to sinus rhythm, and
rate remained in the 80s post pericardiocentesis.

10.  Hypothyroid:  Patient has a history of hypothyroidism. On
initial presentation TSH was elevated at 19, and T4 low at 0.9.
It was unclear whether this was due to subtherapeutic Levoxyl
dosing or sick euthyroid syndrome.  As the patient reported that
her Levoxyl dose had not been changed since [**4-27**], we increased
the dose from 150 to 175mcg daily.  She should plan to have her
TSH level checked in 4 weeks.

11.  Hypertension:  the patient was continued on metoprolol
during her hospitalization. Clonidine and verapimil were held as
of day 4 when she became hypotensive, and were not resumed.
Diovan was restarted prior to discharge.  She was discharged on
metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and diovan 80mg daily for BP control.

12.  Sacral decubitus ulcer:  the patient has a stage I-II
sacral ulcer.  wound care was consulted and recommended duoderms
to the area.  Nutritional support was also encouraged.

13. Transaminitis: Patient had repeat LFTs on [**3-12**] in order to
evaluate synthetic function in the setting of high inr. She has
elevated ast, alt, and ldh, likely from recently being started
on high dose of Zocor. Therefore, this was stopped.  However,
because of increasing lfts and ldh, RUQ ultrasound was obtained
which showed enlargement of the gallbladder to 12 cm with an
additional extensive dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary
system, with lesser dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary
system.  The common hepatic duct and bile duct measured up to
1.6 cm,  however no obstruting stone was seen (and t.bili and
alk phos do not support an obstructive picture), ?mass in
pancreas on utltrasound. We spoke with ERCP fellow eho
recommened MRCP today to further evaluate. MRCP results did not
see any obtsructing stone or masses (see results section) and
ERCP fellow recommended that nothing be done at this point, but
that the patient may need an ERCP at a later time.  The liver
team also saw the patient and felt that the transaminitis was
likely secondary to statin, lfts trended down after stopping the
statin. In addition, MRCP showed bilteral pleural effusions that
are likely secondary to volume overloaded (chf and renal
failure) and will likely improve as we maximize her cardiac
regimen and continue hemodailysis. No indication to do a
throacentesis at this point.
**PATIENT HAD ABNORMAL LFTS ON SIMVISTATIN- A DIFFERENT STATIN
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE RESTARTED AT A LATER DATE

13.  Disposition:  the patient was evaluated by physical and
occupational therapy.  It was recommended that she continue
rehabilitation at a dedicated rehab facility.  She initially
expressed disinterest in rehab, but then agreed to it.  Diet is
a renal, diabetic, low sodium, heart healthy diet.  She is a
full code.  She will follow-up with her primary care physician.
