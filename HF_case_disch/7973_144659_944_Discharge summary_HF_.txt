[**2181-10-10**] CHEST (PA & LAT): A dual-lead pacer device is again noted
with lead tips in the expected location of the right atrium and
right ventricle. The lungs appear essentially clear bilaterally,
aside from mild bibasilar plate-like atelectasis. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. Bones are diffusely osteopenic. Atherosclerotic
calcification along the thoracic aorta is noted. Old right lower
posterolateral rib fractures are again seen.

[**2181-10-11**] EGD: Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy, biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2181-10-11**] Gastric mucosal biopsy:
A.  Gastric body: Antral/corpus type mucosa with chronic
inactive inflammation.
B.  Antrum: Chronic focally active gastritis.
Note:  [**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain for H. pylori will be reported in an
addendum.

[**2181-10-15**] Colonoscopy: Normal mucosa in the whole colon
Polyp at a distance between 80 cm and 65 cm in the colon
Polyp at 20cm in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 83 yoF w/ a h/o CAD and CHF (EF 50%)
presents with epigastric pain, hct drop and supratherapeutic
INR.

# upper GIB / Anemia: baseline hct 30-  [**2181-9-26**], dropped to 19.
INR was supratherapeutic, and aspirin and coumadin were held.
Following transfusions with 2 units prbcs, hct responded to
26.2.  Acute hct drop likely related to GI bleed in the setting
of an elevated INR and guiac positive stools.  Hemodynamically
stable.  No other history for bleeding. NG lavage and EGD were
negative.  Colonoscopy did not show any clear source of
bleeding.  A video capsule study was performed to evaluate the
small bowel for a source of bleeding -- resutls were pending at
discharge.  Folate and B12 levels were wnl.  She will need to
have hct checks 2-3 times / week with results followed by her
primary doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**].  She will need to follow up
restarting her aspiring for coronary artery disease with the
discharge clinic.  She will need to follow up her lower GI bleed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] GI.  She will need to follow up her
anticoagulation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**].  At discharge her hematocrit
was stable and she was restarted on aspirin

# a-fib: Currently a paced.  Coumadin and carvedilol were
initially held then restarted.  Home amiodarone was continued.
LFTs were within normal limits. She has a Chad2 score of 6
indicative of a high stroke risk. Plan to discharge on aspirin
only. After HCT remains stable restarting coumadin should be
considered.

# CAD: the patient has a h/o CAD, s/p MI and s/p LCx mid and
prox stending and mid LAD stenting in [**2172**].  Cath w/o
intervention in [**2176**].  Asa was held and should be restarted at
outpatient discharge clinic appointment if hct is stable.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained normal to rule out
cardiac source of pain.

# + u/a: the patient has had 1 month of dysuria. urinalysis was
consistent with infection. she was treated for three day course
with ciprofloxacin.  EKG was monitored and showed no signs of QT
prolongation.

# ARF: baseline Cr 1.7 - 2.0.  admitted with Cr of 2.2 w/ high
BUN of 80.  Received 1L IVF in ER, FFP, and 2units of PRBC.
Given 40mg PO lasix x 1 dose between blood transfusions.  High
BUN may be secondary to GI bleed as well.  Her Cr normalized to
1.5.

# DM: Placed on insulin sliding scale in hospital.

# Asthma: The patient was wheezing on exam at admission.  She
was given duonebs with good response.  She appeared comfortable,
sating well on room air and expiratory phase is not prolonged.
Stable at discharge.
