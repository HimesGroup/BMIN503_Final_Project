Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
71 male with EtOH cirrhosis brought to the ED by his wife for 1
week of increased abdominal girth, LE edema, confusion. Prior to
this, the pt had good functional status, working up until last
week at which time, the pt started to c/o \"dizziness.\" At PCPs
office, BP was 90s/60s, so his nadolol was D/Cd. Pt also noted
increased weight. Otherwise, the pt denies melena, BRBPR,
fevers/chills. Because of continued weight gain along with
confusion, he was brought in to the ER.
.
In the ER, labs showed Cr 1.3. BP 82/68, HR 125, T 94.6, 96% RA,
BP increased to 100s/60s with 500ml NS. Pt received kayexalate
for K of 6. RUQ U/S showed no pocket to perform paracentesis so
empiric CTX was given for presumed SBP. Lactulose was also given
for encephalopathy. Lopressor 5mg IV was given for ? atrial
flutter, new-onset. He was then admitted to the MICU for
tachycardia


Past Medical History:
1. Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension,
nonocculsive portal vein clot, grade II esophageal varices

RUQ US ([**7-7**]): LIMITED ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN: Comparison is
made to the prior ultrasound dated [**2109-2-7**]. There is
moderate amount of ascites surrounding the liver in the upper
abdomen, slightly increased since prior study. Small amount of
free fluid is seen in the lower abdomen; however, there is no
fluid pocket sufficient for marking. Again note is made of
cirrhotic liver.

IMPRESSION: Moderate amount of ascites surrounding the liver and
small amount of ascites in the lower abdomen. No spot is marked.
.
CXR ([**7-7**]): FINDINGS: There is a new left IJ central catheter
with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein. The right pleural
effusion has increased in size, now moderate-to-large.
Persistent shift of the heart to the right indicates partial
collapse of the right lower and possibly middle lobes. There is
a small left pleural effusion. Diffuse opacity of the abdomen
suggests ascites.

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening right pleural effusion and associated collapse of
the right lower and probably right middle lobes.
2. Ascites.
.
RUQ US w/ Doppler ([**7-8**]): LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The
liver is diffusely hyperechoic and has a nodular contour,
compatible with cirrhosis. The main, left, anterior right portal
veins are patent. Since the prior study, the posterior right
portal venous flow has diminished noticeably, and it is
difficult to get flows within this structure. The splenic, SMV
are patent as is the IVC. There is marked splenomegaly.
Additionally, ultrasound in the four quadrants of the abdomen
was performed, and a spot was marked in the right lower
quadrant.

IMPRESSION:

1. Diminished flow in the posterior right portal vein since the
prior study of [**Month (only) 1096**]. The main, left, and anterior right
portal veins have similar flows to the prior study.

2. Cirrhosis. Splenomegaly.

3. Moderate ascites. A position for paracentesis was marked in
the right lower quadrant.
.
Echo ([**7-9**]):
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 16-20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate global hypokinesis
without regionality. The right ventricle is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic stenosis is seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small,
primarily anterior pericardial effusion withtout
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-7**],
there has been a decline in left and right ventricular systolic
function. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased,
the effusion is more prominent (but remains very small) and
atrial fibrillation is now present. Ascites was also present on
the prior study. An atrial septal defect is not seen on the
current study (may be related to technical differences).
.
CXR ([**7-10**]): There is stable cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified
and tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. The
moderate-sized right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in
size. There continues to be associated compressive atelectasis.
A small left pleural effusion is also noted. Osseous and soft
tissue structures are stable.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or CHF. Slight
decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion. Small left
pleural effusion.
.
CXR ([**7-12**]): The cardiomegaly is moderate and stable. The tortuous
aorta is unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
Bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated, right more than
left, grossly unchanged. The bibasal atelectasis is unchanged as
well. There is new linear opacity in the left lower lobe
representing additional plate-like atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M with alcoholic cirrhosis, grade II varices,
non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis with recannulization
admitted to the MICU with hypotension and atrial
flutter/fibrillation with resolution s/p fluids and rate control
subsequently called out to the floor for continued management.
The following issues were investigated during this
hospitalization:
.
# Hypotension: Etiology thought to be secondary to cirrhosis vs
Afib/flutter with RVR, resolved with IVF and HR control. Sepsis
was considered initially, but seemed unlikely. While on the
general medicine floor, the patient was continued on Ceftriaxone
and Azithromycin for possible PNA and or presumed SBP.
Additionally, he was aggressively diuresed for new CHF. In the
setting of diuresis, the patient at one point became hypotensive
to 80/50. At this time he received a small bolus with good
effect. Diuresis thereafter for obvious fluid overload was
difficult given the tenuous blood pressure. While the etiology
of the tenuous blood pressure was felt to be from 3rd spacing
while being intravascularly depleted it was also thought that
the patient might be becoming symptomatic in his continued
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter. For this reason, the
electrophysiology cardiology team was consulted and Digoxin was
loaded for rhythm control. The patient's blood pressure remained
low, but stable for the remainder of his hospitalization.
.
# Arrhythmia: New-onset Afib/Aflutter on presentation was
thought to be related to discontinuation of Nadolol as an
outpatient. He was loaded with Digoxin in the MICU, which was
not continued on the floor because of rate control with Nadolol
(for varices). However, because of hypotension as detailed
above, additional rate control agents could not be added and yet
the patient was intermittently tachycardic to the 140s. He was
not symptomatic, but continued management, mainly of his heart
failure became complicated. For this reason, additional
mechanisms for control of the arrythmia were considered, to
include cardioversion and anti-arrhythmics. Cardioversion was
not an option given the patient's relative contraindication to
anticoagulation given known grade 2 esophageal varices. For this
reason, the patient was loaded with Digoxin again and continued
on Nadolol for both rhythm and rate control.
.
# Heart Failure: Patient's echo on [**7-9**] showed biventricular
heart failure, changed from prior imaging, with no evidence of
infarct on EKG. Most likely etiology was overall fluid overload
from decompensated cirrhosis, worsened by atrial
fibrillation/flutter. The CHF service was consulted in house and
recommended diuresis with Lasix and Aldactone. This was
initiated reaching a maximum of Aldactone 50 mg and Lasix 40 mg
IV BID, before the patient's blood pressure proved to be
problem[**Name (NI) 115**]. With this diuresis, the patient's creatinine bumped
predictably and he had a contraction alkalosis on daily labs.
Additionally, his O2 requirement decreased from 3 liters to 1
liter. However, he continued to have 3+ pitting edema beyond his
knees in both LEs with a normal albumin. For this reason, the
CHF service was reconsulted and the patient was taken for a
right and left heart cardiac catheterization, after which he was
transferred to the acute cardiac floor for continuous diuresis
with a Lasix drip. Unfortunatelty due to hypotension he was
unable to be furtehr diuresed and the gtt discontinued.

# Decompensated cirrhosis: RUQ U/S revealed diminished flow in
the posterior right portal vein since the prior study of
[**Month (only) 1096**]. AFP was normal. Tbili was elevated, but stable. The
patient's encephalopathy resolved with Lactulose, which was
continued PRN for a goal of [**4-14**] BMs/day. Given documented
esophageal varices in house, the patient was continued on
Nadolol. Prophylactic treatment of presumed SBP was continued
with Ceftriaxone and he was maintained on a PPI. Patient was
diuresed as tolerated with Lasix and Aldactone as detailed above
until complicated by hypotension.
.
# ARF: Creatinine was elevated initially to 1.3, which was
likely in the setting of poor forward flow from cirrhosis. This
resolved with diuresis but then in the setting of further
diuresis, hypotension and worsening decompensated liver failure
complicated by CHF his Cr started to rise most likely mised ATN
amd pre-renal azotemia.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelet count continued to drop
from admission reaching 70,000. While this was thought to be
most likely from his liver disease, his prophylactic,
subcutaneous Heparin was discontinued and HIT antibodies were
sent off. He was given TEDS instead for DVT prophylaxis as well
as for LE edema. He never had any obvious bleeding or signs of
bleeding.
.
# Goals of Care:  Due to worsening decompensated liver failure
and CHF discussion as to goals of care were had between patient,
wife and primary team.  Decision made to concentrate on comfort
and means to get patient home with family.  He was discharged to
home with hospice on [**2109-7-24**].
