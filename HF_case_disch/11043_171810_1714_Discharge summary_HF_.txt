Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname 9818**] [**Known lastname 9723**] is a
60-year-old gentleman with a history of severe end-stage
ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post coronary artery bypass
grafting, status post biventricular pacemaker, on home
milrinone who presents for tailored congestive heart failure
therapy.

In the Catheterization Laboratory, he had resting
hemodynamics performed to assess response to escalating doses
of inotropic afterload reduction.  His home milrinone was
supposedly at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min with a response to
this in the Catheterization Laboratory with cardiac output
and index of 3.91 and 2.37; respectively.  In the
Catheterization Laboratory, he had a slight increase in
cardiac output and index in response to increasing doses of
milrinone; however, he had the most significant result with
0.9 mcg/kg/min of milrinone and 0.01 mcg/kg/min of Natrecor
with a cardiac output and index of 5.32 and 3.23;
respectively.

He was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
further therapy.  At the time of admission to the Coronary
Care Unit, he denied any chest pain or shortness of breath
and actually admitted that he had no change in symptoms at
home prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post biventricular pacemaker and automatic
internal cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
5.  Severe end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is originally from [**Country 9819**].  He
formerly as a cashier.  He denies any tobacco, alcohol, or
drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Current home medications
included)
 1.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Lipitor 30 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
 5.  Carvedilol 6.25 mg by mouth twice per day.
 6.  Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Repaglinide 1 mg by mouth three times per day.
 8.  Epogen 10,000 units subcutaneously three times per week.
 9.  Colchicine 0.3 mg by mouth once per day.
10.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice per day.
11.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.
12.  Milrinone 0.75 mcg/kg/min.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on
admission revealed the patient's heart rate was 72 (which was
paced), his blood pressure was 111/54, his respiratory rate
was 12, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.  In
general, the patient was alert and oriented times three.  He
was pleasant and in no acute distress.   Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.   The extraocular muscles were
intact.  The oropharynx was moist and without lesions or
exudates.  Neck examination revealed a right internal jugular
with Swan placement.  His lungs had fine bibasilar crackles.
His heart was regular.  Normal first heart sounds and second
heart sounds.  There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and distended.  There were
normal active bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
his extremities were thin and cool.  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission with a complete blood count which revealed his
white blood cell count was 6.4, his platelets were 309, and
his hematocrit was 33.5.  The patient had a sodium of 135
potassium was 4.3, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 26, blood
urea nitrogen was 97, and his creatinine was 1.8.  His
magnesium was 2.5.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient has a history of
coronary artery disease.  He was continued on his aspirin,
Plavix, Lipitor, ACE inhibitor, and beta blocker while
admitted.

(a)  Pump0:  With regard to his pump function, he obviously
had end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy and was admitted for
tailored hemodynamic therapy.  He was continued on Natrecor
0.1 mcg/kg/min and milrinone 0.6 mcg/kg/min on the floor with
very effective diuresis and maintenance of good cardiac
output and index.  His goal on admission was a wedge pressure
of less 20; which was obtained approximately five hours after
admission.

The original plan was to wean the milrinone and Natrecor and
try the patient on dopamine in order to obtain a wedge
pressure of less than 20; however, this was obtained with
milrinone and Natrecor on admission.

There were several discussions regarding a heart transplant
and possible transfer to [**Hospital 4415**] for
workup for a heart transplant, which the patient stated he
was not interested in.  However, after multiple discussions
with his family he eventually decided that he would like to
undergo further evaluation for a heart transplant.  He was to
be transferred to [**Hospital 4415**] to pursue this
further.

(b)  Rhythm:  With regard to his rhythm, the patient has a
biventricular pacemaker with an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator.  His pacemaker was functioning
fine throughout this admission.  He had occasional ectopy;
however, not significant.

2.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient has a history of diabetes
mellitus and was continued on his repaglinide at 1 mg three
times per day.  He had four times per day fingerstick checks
and was covered with a regular insulin sliding-scale.

3.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.5.  His
last creatinine prior to admission was 2.2.  At the time of
admission, his creatinine was 1.8 and improved slightly with
diuresis.  There was some concern considering his milrinone
was not at a renal dose; however, his creatinine was falling
with further diuresis.  The milrinone was maintained at 0.6
mcg/kg/min.

4.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
continued on a cardiac, diabetic, and renal diet.

5.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION ISSUES:  The original plan once the
patient refused further workup for a heart transplant was to
pull the Swan and continue him on milrinone, and monitor him
on the floor, and then send him home at a dose of 0.6
mcg/kg/min with further followup.  However, he had decided he
was interested in a heart transplant and was to be
transferred to [**Hospital 4415**] for further workup.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Status post biventricular pacemaker and automatic
internal cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge, the
patient was without complaints.  He denied any chest pain or
shortness of breath and was extremely stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Lipitor 30 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
 5.  Carvedilol 6.25 mg by mouth twice per day.
 6.  Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Repaglinide 1 mg by mouth three times per day.
 8.  Epogen 10,000 units subcutaneously three times per week.
 9.  Colchicine 0.3 mg by mouth once per day.
10.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice per day.
11.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.
12.  Milrinone 0.6 mcg/kg/min.
13.  Natrecor 0.01 mcg/kg/min.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to be transferred to the [**Hospital 8503**] for further evaluation for a heart transplant.
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up in the Heart
Failure Clinic by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
