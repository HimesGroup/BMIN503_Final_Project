.
EKG:  NSR @ 93 bpm, LAD, LVH, pseudonormalization of T waves in
V1-V6 since prior tracing [**5-7**].
.
pCXR [**2157-2-15**]:
Since most recent comparison film, there appears to be increased
interstitial alveolar opacities likely representing [**Month/Day/Year 9140**]
pulmonary edema with unchanged appearance to cardiomegaly, and
linear calcifications within the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta.  No focal parenchymal consolidation, pleural
effusions, or pneumothorax is identified
.
pCXR [**2157-2-16**]:
A small atelectasis is seen in the left lower lobe retrocardiac
area.  There has been almost complete resolution of the
pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The aorta is unfolded with
extensive atheromatous plaques in the ascending, descending, and
the arch

Brief Hospital Course:
73-yo-woman w/ CAD, CHF, ESRD on HD, HIV, HCV, HTN, and anemia
presents w/ dyspnea, thought [**2-4**] pulmonary edema in setting of
hypertensive emergency.
.
# Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath was felt most
likely secondary to pulmonary edema as evidenced by initial exam
and CXR in setting of severe hypertension.   Pt with CHF and
renal failure, making her prone to this.  There is no evidence
of PNA, PE, or obstructive disease.  The precipitant is unknown,
but the patient does have a history of flash pulmonary edema.
She denies medication non-compliance or excessive sodium
consumption.  Her shortness of breath resolved after
hemodialysis and better BP control, and she maintained her O2
saturation on room air. Cardiac enzymes revealed flat CKs and
elevated troponins (in setting of ESRD)   which did not rise.
She continued hemodialysis and will continue to be followed by
the [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location (un) **].
.
# Chest pain: The patient is known to have 3vd, w/ stent in LCX.
  Her pain was in the setting of hypertensive emergency and
resolved with control of her blood pressure, including nitro
drip.  There were no specific EKG changes on presentation to
indicate active ischemia.  Her cardiac enzymes were notable for
an elevated troponin (in setting of ESRD), with flat CKs.  She
was monitored on telemetry withoug event.  Her chest pain did
not recur.  She was placed back on her home medications: ASA,
metoprolol, ACEI, lipitor, and zetia.  She should follow up with
her cardiologist.
.
# ESRD: Her renal failure is secondary to HIV nephropathy.  She
was urgently dialyzed on the day of admission and then placed
back on her usual dialysis schedule(M,W,F).  She was followed by
the renal service who recommended to switch lisinopril to
captopril [**Hospital1 **] (this was done).  She was continued on Renagel and
Sensipar.  The patient will continue to be followed by the
[**Hospital6 **] in [**Location (un) **], with dialysis M,W,F.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure was
initially controlled with volume removal by HD, IV enalapril, IV
hydralazine, and nitroglycerin drip.  Her BP normalized and she
was placed back on her home regimen and monitored.  Her
pressures remained appropriate.  As per renal, her ACEI was
changed to Captopril 50mg [**Hospital1 **].  She will continue on Toprol XL
and Captopril [**Hospital1 **] as an outpatient.  Her HD will resume at
[**Hospital6 **] tomorrow.
.
# Elevated amylase/lipase: This is chronic and likely a chemical
pancreatitis from her [**Hospital6 2775**] therapy.  There were no signs of
clinical pancreatitis.  The patient will follow with her ID
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
.
# HIV: The patient's viral load is suppressed with [**Last Name (STitle) 2775**].  She
was continued on lamivudine, nevirapine, and zidovudine.  She
has follow up scheduled with her Infectious disease specialist
this month.
.
# DM type 2: This is controlled with diet as an outpt.  Her
fingerstick blood glucose was check four times daily.  She was
covered with an insulin sliding scale.  She did not require much
insulin and will resume diet control as an outpatient.
.
# FEN: [**Doctor First Name **], low sodium, cardiac diet.  Her electrolytes were
repleted prn.
.
# Proph: She was given heparin SC, but developed a hematoma in
her abdomen from these injections.  Therefore her heparin
injections were stopped.  She was ambulatory on the floor.  She
was given a bowel regimen.
