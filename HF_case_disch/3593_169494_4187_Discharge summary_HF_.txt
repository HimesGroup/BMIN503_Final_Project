Date of Birth:   [**2039-8-22**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis),
peripheral vascular disease (status post below-knee
(status post myocardial infarction times two) who was
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for arteriovenous graft
removal.

The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] for low back pain in [**2109-8-27**].  She was
found to have a compression fracture with questionable
for rehabilitation three weeks ago.

On Friday, [**10-4**], the patient was noted to have pus
draining from her old right arteriovenous fistula graft.
Blood cultures and wound cultures were drawn, and the patient
was started on vancomycin.  On Saturday, the patient was
communicative but seemed more confused than normal.  The
confusion worsened on Sunday.  The patient reportedly had
chills but no fever.

Today, the patient went for hemodialysis and was noted to
have [**2-28**] positive blood cultures that grew
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and a wound
culture that grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus
aureus.  The patient was given a second dosing of vancomycin.
The patient was also noted to have a blood sugar of 39 and
was given a half ampule of D-50.  Reportedly, the patient had
not received insulin that morning.  Her INR which on Friday
was noted to be 2.9 was measured as 7.4 and later greater
than 11.5.  The patient was also noted to have an evaluated
bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for removal of arteriovenous graft.  The patient was
admitted to Surgery attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient became
unresponsive on the surgery floor and was noted to have
systolic blood pressures in the 70s; reportedly baseline is
between 80 and 90.  The patient was bolused with intravenous
fluids which increased the systolic blood pressure to the 80s
and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
closer observation of blood pressures.

The patient reportedly had not been eating well over the past
three weeks and also had been having diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis Monday,
Wednesday and Friday for two years).
 2.  Status post right arteriovenous graft placement in

that was recently tested.
 5.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarctions, last one in [**2108-12-28**].  Status post
catheterization in [**2108-12-28**] which showed 3-vessel

the left anterior descending artery.
 6.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
25%; catheterization showed severe systolic and diastolic
dysfunction.
 7.  Atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to IODINE, CLINDAMYCIN, and FERRALET.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Renagel 1200 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Nephrocaps, Protonix, [**Doctor First Name **],
Isordil, amiodarone, Neurontin, Coumadin (which was held
since [**9-26**]), Plavix, Lidoderm, Tylenol No. 3, Colace,
Senna, Dulcolax, calcitonin, Vioxx.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A retired social worker at [**Hospital3 18242**].  An ex-smoker; quit 35 years ago.  She denies
alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for coronary
artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and seizures.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
patient was unresponsive to voice but grimaced to pain.
Temperature was 97.1, blood pressure was 87/48, pulse was 74,
respiratory rate was 17, pulse oximetry was 98% on 2 liters.
An obese elderly woman in no acute distress.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae were anicteric.
Mucous membranes were dry.  No jugular venous distention.  A
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second
heart sound.  A [**1-2**] holosystolic murmur at the left lower
sternal border.  A tunnel dialysis catheter in the right
chest.  Lung examination revealed poor respiratory effort,
diffuse rales.  The abdomen was soft, hypoactive bowel
sounds, diffuse mild tenderness.  No rebound.  Extremities
revealed trace edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses on the left, a
right below-knee amputation.  A fluctuant mass at the right
arteriovenous graft site with ulceration and drainage of pus.
An ulcer on the left lower extremity without discharge.  A
decubitus ulcer on the sacral region.  Deep peroneal ulcer
with purulent discharge.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
were pertinent for an elevated alkaline phosphatase and
bilirubin; most of which was total bilirubin which was
measured at 3.  Also INR came back at 24.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE/PLAN:

1.  INFECTED ARTERIOVENOUS GRAFT:  The patient went for
surgery the following day.  The graft was removed.  The
patient persisted to remain hypotensive after graft
placement.

2.  HYPOTENSION:  Question whether this was sepsis versus
hypovolemia.  The patient was initially given bolus fluids;
however, eventually required dopamine for pressures.  This
was eventually switched to Levophed, and later she was put on
Vasopressin with some success getting off the Levophed;
however, the patient remained requiring Vasopressin until she
expired.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis.  She was
started on vancomycin and gentamicin.  She was initially
started on Flagyl, but this was discontinued.  It was felt
that the patient likely had intervascular infection and at
some point would need an echocardiogram; or at some point
evaluation to see if her dialysis catheter was infected.

4.  ELEVATED INR:  The patient was given 8 units of fresh
frozen plasma with correction of INR.  This suggested it was
likely due to decrease synthesis rather than destruction.
The patient was also given vitamin K.  Her coagulations were
followed.  She required one bag of platelets and five bags of
packed red blood cells.  Access was obtained through the left
internal jugular site, and the patient persisted to
bleed/ooze from this site during her entire hospital course.
The oozing did improve, however, as her INR corrected.

5.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was electively intubated
for airway protection.  She remained intubated until after
surgery; at which point in time she was attempted to be
extubated.  However, the patient became hypoxic, and the
family signed do not intubate order.  Unable to intubate the
patient.  The patient went into hypoxic-induced ventricular
tachycardia.  She was not resuscitated, as she was made do
not resuscitate, and the patient expired.

6.  GYNECOLOGY:  Her peroneal ulcer was examined.  No signs
of abscess.

7.  RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient went for hemodialysis the
following day.  She was continued on her renal medications.
Firstly, after dialysis, she was volume overloaded, and
because of her hypotension, we were unable to remove fluids
from her.  It was likely that this contributed to her
hypoxemia.

8.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was discontinued on
the Plavix for the upcoming surgery.  She was hypotensive and
was bolused carefully.  However, it appeared that she had
gone into congestive heart failure to some extent as her
chest x-ray showed signs of fluid overload.  The patient had
atrial fibrillation; however, she was supratherapeutic on her
INR, and Coumadin was held.  Amiodarone was held as it was a
possible cause of her elevated liver function tests.

For her elevated liver function tests, the patient had a
right upper quadrant ultrasound and Doppler.  It did not show
any signs of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease or obstruction.

The patient's mental status waxed and waned during the course
of her admission.  She required sedation when she was on the
ventilator.

9.  DIABETES:  She was started on an insulin sliding-scale;
however, she remained hypoglycemic during most of her
admission and required several D-5 ampules.

On her final day of the hospital course, family had a meeting
with the medical team and discussed wanting to extubate the
patient.  The patient's poor prognosis was discussed with the
family as she likely had intravascular infection; however, it
was made clear that if she were extubated, she had a very good
chance of becoming hypoxic.  This was understood by the
family who still wanted to extubate the patient. They indicated
that it had been the patient's expressed desire to avoid a
prolonged time on mechanical ventilation.

The patient was extubated, and within one hour after
extubation she became even more unresponsive and went into
ventricular tachycardia.  The patient expired 30 minutes
later.
