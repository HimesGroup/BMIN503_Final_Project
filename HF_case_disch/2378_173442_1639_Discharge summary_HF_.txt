STUDIES:
[**2142-5-22**] CXR - Multifocal lung base opacities; may represent
multifocal
pneumonia with superimposed atelectasis. Aspiration may be
considered as
well. Followup to resolution recommended.

2. Large amount of stool in the colon.
3. Overdistended bladder.

may be due to infection or atelectasis.

[**2142-5-23**] CXR - Slightly increased bilateral layering pleural
effusions, which are moderately large with mild pulmonary edema


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo female with history of COPD, recurrent pneumonia,
diastolic congestive heart failure, and s/p left total hip
arthroplasty on [**2142-4-26**] was admitted with respiratory distress
and abdominal pain. She was found to have multifocal pneumonia
and marked constipation.

1. Pneumonia
Etiology of her respiratory distress was most likely related to
pneumonia as seen on CXR. She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin and was
quickly weaned from 6L to room air. Her sputum culture grew
E.coli sensitive to ceftriaxone and MRSA. She was discharged to
complete a 10 day course of vancomycin and ceftriaxone
(4/6-15/10) Her respiratory status was likely worsened with her
baseline severe COPD and congestive heart failure.

2. COPD
She was continued on her home regimen of advair, tiotropium, and
home dose of steroids.

3. Constipation
Etiology of her abdominal pain is most likely related to
constipation which improved with aggressive bowel regimen with
enemas and manual disimpaction. Her symptoms improved with bowel
movements.

4. s/p Left total hip arthroplasty [**2142-4-26**]:
She underwent hip surgery and had minimal pain. She was
continued on tylenol for pain control.

5. Chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure
Patient was found to have bilateral pleural effusions but
remaiend stable on room air. Given that she was clinically
stable, we did not aggressively diurese her. We continued her on
her beta blocker and started lasix.

6. Coronary artery disease
Patient was continued on her home regimen of statin, aspirin,
and beta blocker.

7. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient is in sinus rhythm during this admission. She was
continued on a beta blocker for rate control and warfarin for
anticoagulation.

8. History of PE/DVT
She was continued on coumadin and remained therapeutic during
her admission.
