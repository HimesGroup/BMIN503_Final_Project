History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is n 80-year-old woman with longstanding MVP and
moderate-to-severe MR who is recovering from multiple
hospitalizations, most recently due to severe congestive heart
failure in [**2152-11-26**]. Currently she admits to feeling stronger.
Her endurance remains poor, and she continues to experience
exertional dyspnea. Her appetite is good, and she is eating
three meals per day and two snacks. The head of her bed remains
elevated at all times to prevent aspiration.
** Per cardiology, she is unable to tolerate dabigatran, and she
cannot have a TEE because of her esophageal issues. She is on
Warfarin **. Given mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with
worsening PA pressures, she was admitted for cardiac cath today
and found to have clean coronaries. She will be placed on
heparin drip and await MVR on [**2153-3-19**].

[**2153-3-16**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
flow-limiting CAD although atherosclerosis was evident.  The
LMCA had an ostial 20% lesion.  The LAD had a ostial 25% lesion,
large D2 and distal vessel that wraps around the apex.  The LCX
had a 40% ostial stenosis and tortuous large OM3 and LPL.  The
RCA had a vertical origin, luminal irregularities to 30% in the
mid and distal section.  Tortuous RPDA, RPL1 and AM vessels were
noted as well as a modest caliber RPL2. 2. Resting hemodynamics
revealed elevated biventricular filling pressures with a mean
PCWP 35mm Hg and mean RVEDP 17mmHg at rest. Severe pulmonary
arterial hypertension with systolic, diastolic, and mean PA
pressures of 70/28/44mm Hg.  Prominent V waves consistent with
significant mitral regurgitation was also noted. Low cardiac
output cardiac index was reduced at 1.50 L/min/m2.  Entry PVR of
328 dyne-sec/cm5 and SVR of 3138 dyne-sec/cm5 was noted.

Final Report
INDICATION: 80-year-old woman, status post mitral and tricuspid
valve repair,
with now right-sided weakness and lethargy.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the head without
intravenous
contrast.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, mass, or
mass effect. A new relatively well-defined hypodense region in
the medial
left frontal lobe, in the ACA territory, is consistent with an
acute
infarction. A tiny focus of hyperdensity in the parasagittal
frontal location
(2:8) may represent a focal \"hyperdense ACA\" with intramural
thrombus versus
plaque. No intracranial hemorrhage is detected. There is mild
mass effect on
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. No
rightward shift of
midline structures is seen. The basal cisterns are normal. The
imaged
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: Acute left ACA territory infarct, with possible
focal
hyperdensity in the A2/A3 segment of the left ACA, which may
represent in situ
thrombus versus embolized atheromatous plaque (or other
material).

COMMENT: The above findings were made at 2:55 p.m, and discussed
with Ms.

[**2153-3-22**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]
Final Report
INDICATION: Stroke, status post MVR.

COMPARISON: CT head [**2153-3-21**].

TECHNIQUE: MRI and MRA of the head was obtained without contrast
and MRA of
the neck was obtained before and after administration of
contrast per
department protocol.

FINDINGS:

MRI HEAD: There is an area of slow diffusion in the left frontal
lobe
extending into the corpus callosum with accompanying FLAIR
signal abnormality.
There is no signal abnormality on the gradient echo images to
suggest
hemorrhage. There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
Ventricles and
sulci are age appropriate. The major intracranial flow voids
appear
preserved. A 6mm size T1 hyperintense lesion is noted within the
anterior
pituitary. Visualized orbits and mastoid air cells are
unremarkable. There is
mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.

MRA HEAD: The MRA of the head is compromised by motion
artifacts. In the
left A2 segment is not well visualized. Bilateral internal
carotid arteries,
vertebral arteries, basilar arteries are patent with no evidence
of
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, dissection or aneurysm
formation. The
right vertebral artery is dominant.

MRA NECK: Aortic arch shows normal three-vessel takeoff.
Bilateral common
carotid arteries, vertebral arteries in the neck and internal
carotid arteries
are patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection
or
pseudoaneurysm formation. The left vertebral artery is seen
arising directly
from the aortic arch.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left A2 occlusion with early subacute infarct in the left ACA
territory as
described above. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
2. 6mm size T1 hyperintense lesion is noted within the anterior
pituitary, may
represent a Rathke cleft cyst, and less likely hemorrhagic
adenoma.
2. Unremarkable MRA of the neck.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No mass/thrombus seen in the left
or right atrium, but this study is not adequate to fully exclude
atrial/atrial appendage thrombus ((ie atrial appendages not well
visualized). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). The estimated cardiac
index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricular apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
without aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. No mitral regurgitation is seen,
though cannot exclude fully due to acoustic shadowing from the
ring. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A
tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present. Physiologic
tricuspid regurgitation is seen, though may be underestimated
due to shadowing. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely reduced global systolic function of the
left and right ventricle. Mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty
rings present. No mass or thrombi seen in the atria, though
cannot fully exclude by transthoracic echocardiography. Mildly
dilated aortic sinus.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-1-31**], the
left ventricular function is markedly depressed. Mitral and
tricuspid annuloplasty rings are now noted.

If suspicion for atrial thrombus is high, consideration can be
given to other imaging studies (eg cardiac MRI, CT), as the
patient is unable to undergo TEE.

Final Report
INDICATION: 80-year-old woman with increasing LFTs, assess for
portal vein
thrombus.

COMPARISONS: [**2152-4-30**].

The liver is normal in echotexture without focal lesion, intra-
or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The portal vein and its
major
branches are patent. Pulsatile flow is seen in the portal vein
which may
reflect underlying cardiac dysfunction. Common bile duct is not
dilated
measuring 4 mm. Small amount of sludge is seen in the
gallbladder which is
otherwise unremarkable in appearance without wall thickening,
distention or
pericholecystic fluid to suggest cholecystitis. Trace
perihepatic ascites is
seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Patent portal vein without evidence of thrombus. Pulsatility
in the
portal vein could reflect underlying cardiac disease.
2. Trace perihepatic ascites.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac cath on [**3-16**]
and was admitted following cath. She was medically managed,
including Heparin, and [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] further surgical work-up. On
[**3-19**] she was brought to the operating room where she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a
mitral and tricuspid valve repair. She received Vancomycin and
Kefzol for prophylaxis given her inpatient length of stay
greater than 24 hours.  Please see operative note for surgical
details. Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was
weaned from sedation, and extubated.  She was initially drowsy.
Later, on POD 1, she failed to follow commands and exhibited
right sided weakness.  Neurology was consulted.  Head CT
revealed left ACA infarct.  Neurology continued to follow.
Anti-coagulation was initiated with heparin and coumadin.  EEG
was instituted to assess for seizure activity.  She remained in
atrial fibrillation.  Digoxin was resumed and lopressor titrated
as tolerated.  She was initially loaded with Keppra for seizure
activity noted on EEG, however due to worsening somnolence, it
was discontinued.  Infarct was followed on CT to evaluate for
hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of anti-coagulation for
atrial fibrillation.  LFTs became elevated.  RUQ ultrasound did
not reveal acute findings. She remained in the CVICU for close
observation of airway protection in the setting of her infarct
and rhoncherous secretions. A Dobhoff tube was placed for tube
feeds. All lines and drains were discontinued per protocol.
Current clinical picture is consistent with Left ACA infarct
likely due to embolic
etiology and exam shows profound abulia with a right
hemiparesis. Her level of arousal is depressed. She remains
hemodynamically stable in rate controlled afib. In light of her
neuro status she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] successful open J -tube  on POD#13
and had been tolerating her tube feeds well. On POD 15 she was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 8**]. All follow
up appointments were advised.
