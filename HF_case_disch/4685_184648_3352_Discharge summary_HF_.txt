Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old gentlemen
with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who had a four to five
day history of shortness of breath and chest pressure and
eventually presented to an outside hospital on [**2121-2-19**].  He received hemodialysis earlier that same day and was
noted to be hypotensive after Dialysis with systolic blood
pressures in the 70s.  His symptoms did not resolved with
rest and he presented to the Emergency Room at an outside
hospital with hypotension, congestive heart failure, elevated
troponin and electrocardiogram changes. He was then
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room for further evaluation.

Initially he was on dopamine, aspirin, Lovenox, nitroglycerin
and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  Patient was
initially restarted on BiPAP and Lasix with improved
respiratory symptoms.  However, the day following, the
patient experienced cardiac arrest and was coded for 40
minutes with recovery complicated by cardiogenic shock.

During hospitalization he was noted to have a new murmur and
was evaluated for possible endocarditis.  Patient was
intubated during his cardiac arrest for cardiogenic shock and
was noted to have a white blood cell count of 18.4,
congestive heart failure on chest x-ray and ischemic
electrocardiogram changes.  He was initially started on
vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Patient was also started on
CVVH for further fluid removal with concern for his
hypotension.  Eventually patient had his levofloxacin changes
to gentamicin and had an echocardiogram which showed severely
depressed ejection fraction and severe aortic stenosis.
Patient at times converted into atrial fibrillation and was
shocked successfully and then had a PEA arrest and then was
successfully resuscitated from that.

Patient then went to the cardiac catheterization and had
normal coronaries.  Valvuloplasty was attempted without
success and then was repeated with some success.  Patient had
noted a background of a several months history of purpuric
rash.  Biopsy was consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis
per Dermatology.  The patient was admitted in his early
hospital was being managed for hypotension cardiogenic shock,
aortic stenosis with presumed endocarditis, pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure exacerbation, end stage renal
disease on hemodialysis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 49-year-old gentlemen with
peripheral vascular disease, end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis, aortic stenosis, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, status post left below the knee
amputation, who was transferred from an outside hospital with
hypotension, congestive heart failure and increased troponins
with electrocardiogram changes.

1.  Cardiogenic shock:  Patient came in hypotensive and
>.........<component of sepsis.  Patient had negative blood
cultures, but did have concern for endocarditis.  Patient was
initially on dopamine and was transitioned to Levophed
regimen.  Patient had a PEA arrest that was described above
and was intubated for shock.  Patient had a prolonged
intubation and eventually required tracheostomy for
respiratory status and for further suctioning.

Patient did well on the trachea collar and was eventually
transitioned to a smaller trachea size so he could tolerate
talking.  Patient continues to require b.i.d. suctioning for
his respiratory status, which was exacerbated from diffuse
pulmonary edema in light of congestive heart failure
exacerbation on admission.  Patient's respiratory status
improved with CVVAT hemodialysis, and eventually resumed to
his regular hemodialysis regimen.  He remained stable on
Levophed and this was eventually weaned off as patient was
continued on CVVH but as he was transitioned to regular
hemodialysis, required some blood pressure support with
Levophed, but overall his blood pressure remained stable
throughout the course of his stay and was started on
anti-hypertensives by the end of his admission.

2.  Hypotension:  There was also concern for sepsis.  Patient
had multiple blood cultures drawn with no growth, but was
treated empirically for endocarditis in light of his worsened
murmur and patient was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin
initially and eventually changed to vancomycin and
gentamicin, and then Flagyl was started empirically but then
continued because patient continued to remain febrile
throughout the course of his stay, and he had a positive
>.......< blood culture.  Other than that his blood cultures
remained negative throughout the course of his stay.
Patient's blood pressure improved on antibiotics.

3.  Aortic stenosis:  Patient was treated for a presumed
endocarditis for a total of six weeks with vancomycin,
gentamicin, and Flagyl.  Patient will complete this course on
[**4-3**].  Patient was followed by the Infectious Disease
Service to help tailor antibiotics.  Patient initially
underwent valvuloplasty which was unsuccessful on the first
attempt, but was able to have some success on the second
attempt.  During this intervention, patient also had a look
at his coronary arteries, which were clean on cardiac
catheterization.  Even though patient was initially brought
in for question of ischemic changes and borderline troponin,
patient's troponin was negative and his CKs were negative
here and it is unlikely that patient had an ischemic event.

4.  Decreased ejection fraction:  Patient was noted after
admission and after arrest to have a decreased ejection
fraction to 30%.  Patient's fluid status was managed by
hemodialysis.  Once his blood pressures were stable, patient
continued to have fluid removed during Dialysis and his fluid
balance was otherwise stable while on hemodialysis.

5.  Rhythm:  Patient did have a PEA arrest for which he was
resuscitated with good success and later did have a run of
atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Initially intermittent and
then converted to sinus after he was loaded on amiodarone,
however, patient had a prolonged QTC interval and was
switched over to digoxin which he tolerated well.  Patient is
in sinus rhythm now throughout with occasional premature
ventricular contractions.  Otherwise, his rhythm is stable as
he maintained good rate control and rhythm on the digoxin.

6.  Ischemic changes on his electrocardiogram:  Patient was
initially started on an aspirin statin regimen, however,
patient had clean coronaries through his catheterization and
his electrocardiogram changes were attributed to demand and
patient's statin was discontinued.  Patient was continued on
an aspirin, however, eventually was started on a low dose
beta-blocker for rate control and for improved cardiac
function.

7.  Decreased ejection fraction:  Patient had an ejection
fraction of 30%, which was depressed from his admission
echocardiogram.  Patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram
on [**2-25**] which showed no vegetation to suggest
endocarditis, but with patient's aortic stenosis and high
fevers, patient was treated empirically to complete a six
week course for endocarditis.  Patient will complete six
weeks of vancomycin, gentamicin and Flagyl, which will be
complete on [**2121-4-3**].

8.  Fluid status:  Fluid status was managed via hemodialysis
as patient was unable to diurese with his end stage renal
disease.

9.  For patient's aortic stenosis, patient underwent cardiac
catheterization as described above with balloon aortic
valvuloplasty.  Patient had successful balloon aortic
valvuloplasty on [**2121-2-21**].  He has had previous
failed attempts, but was successful on this admission and
during the procedure, patient did have recurrent episodes of
atrial fibrillation and was cardioverted during the procedure
and was otherwise stable and again plans were to treat
patient's aortic stenosis as per previous.

10. Cardiac arrest:  Patient was status post PEA arrest which
occurred on [**2121-2-21**].  Patient was coded for about
45 minutes with good result.  Did have intermittent
ventricular tachycardia during code.  Patient had a pacemaker
temporary wire placed and amiodarone again as described above
was initiated, which was eventually titrated off.  Otherwise,
patient responded to this and was intubated during the code
and had a prolonged intubation as described before, and
patient eventually had a trachea placed on [**2121-3-10**] as
he required re-intubation for airway protection and had a
prolonged respiratory course with lots of copious secretions
and to support his airway.

Patient was eventually on the trachea and weaned off the
ventilator and did well; 40% trachea mask with b.i.d.
suctioning.  Patient's trachea was eventually transitioned to
a smaller size in which he could talk around and he currently
has a 6-0 silus trachea cuff which he is doing well with.  He
once removed it, but this was replaced easily and stitched
back in to place.  He did have slight bleeding at the site
which remained stable after some topical thrombin and this
also remained stable.  Patient had a couple of follow-up
bronchoscopies to better evaluate.  At one point, he did have
a little bit of bleeding in his right lower lobe.  This was
evaluated by >.........<which showed new focal consolidation
opacity in the right lower lobe which could have been just an
area of pneumonia and a pre-existing area of atelectasis.
Shifting areas of edema with improvement in the right upper
lobe and slight increase in the right upper lobe ground glass
opacities.  Overall was consistent with increased congestive
heart failure, and again, congestive heart failure fluid
balance was managed by hemodialysis.

11.  Endocarditis:  Patient was treated empirically with
vancomycin, gentamicin and Flagyl.  Flagyl was dosed 250 q.
8.  The vancomycin is dosed for levels less than 20, which
turns out to be a dose of vancomycin after hemodialysis and
patient's gentamicin is also dosed 80 mg q. hemodialysis and
again, patient will complete his course on [**4-3**].
Otherwise, patient's fevers [**Month (only) 14976**] over the last week of
his admission and was otherwise stable from this perspective.
Patient did have multiple lines during the course of his stay
and these were likely the source of his persistent fevers
over the first four weeks of his stay.  It was also thought
that patient had some element of drug fever.

Patient was initially on Ceftriaxone, then switched to
ceftazidime and eventually transitioned to gentamicin, and
his fevers [**Last Name (LF) 14976**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] some component of his fevers
throughout the course of his stay may have been secondary to
drug fevers in addition to line infection.  Patient did have
left subclavian Hickman for further access, and did have some
femoral lines. However, these were all discontinued and once
patient's lines were removed, patient [**First Name3 (LF) 14976**].

Eventually for access, patient had PICC line placed in his
left forearm for intravenous antibiotics and access.  Patient
had a repeated number of Foley's changes to prevent and rule
out urinary sources as a source of his infection.  Patient
also had a lumbar puncture attempted.  Initially attempted in
the unit and eventually because of his back surgery, this was
unable to be done at bedside.  He went under fluoroscopy and
had a lumbar puncture done which was negative for any
infectious sources, and again patient's fevers were
attributed to presumed endocarditis and persistent fevers
were attributed to line infections versus drug fever and
again patient [**First Name3 (LF) 14976**] over the last week of his stay and
remained afebrile.

12.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis:  Patient has
end stage renal disease on hemodialysis over the past year of
unknown etiology.  Patient initially on CVVH as blood
pressure could not tolerate large volume changes from
hemodialysis and eventually was transitioned back to three
times weekly hemodialysis regimen which he tolerated well.
Patient was followed by the Renal Service throughout the
course of his stay and eventually as he had elevated
phosphorus, patient was started on calcium binders.
Initially on amphojel and then started on calcium acetate and
Nephrocaps.  Issues arose secondary to questioning of
medications, but this was worked out by the course of his
discharge.  Patient's fluid balances remained stable on this
regimen of three times weekly hemodialysis, which he
tolerated without further difficulty.  Patient gets his
hemodialysis through his right AV fistula.  During the course
of his stay, patient noted to have increasingly right upper
extremity edema.

Patient initially attributed to right IJ clots which were
seen on catheterization.  Patient was seen and evaluated by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2572**], however, patient had a stent attempted of
this area, but were unable to keep this area patent, so
patient was started on anticoagulation for this area of
stenosis and clots.   However, patient's swelling persisted
while on anticoagulation and patient was seen by the
Transplant Surgery Service >.........<and noted to have a
pseudoaneurysm within his right AV fistula.  Patient was
eventually taken to the Operating Room for revision of this
fistula.  He had his revision of his fistula in the right
upper extremity on [**2121-3-26**] without complications, and
this was continued to be used for Dialysis before and after.
The more proximal area of fistula which is preferred use for
his Dialysis.

13.  Neurological:  Mental status:  Patient did have a
prolonged PEA arrest where he was coded for over 45 minutes.
Concern with patient's altered mental status after this was
that he had some type of anoxic brain injury.  Also concern
for septic emboli in light of patient's endocarditis.
Patient was seen and followed by the Neurology Service and
patient had an MRI on [**3-8**], which showed multiple
hemorrhagic foci with mild surrounding edema and enhancement
predominantly located in the cortical and subcortical
regions, both cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.
Eventually, patient had a normal MRA of the head and
eventually patient had follow-up MR of the head on [**2121-3-15**] which showed slight decrease in edema and enhancement
surrounding the hemorrhagic foci in the supra and
infratentorial region compared to the previous stay and no
new lesions were identified and no shift or hydrocephalus
were noted.

Patient's mental status remained slightly confused and was
attributed again to patient's anoxic brain injury. Patient
had some delirium throughout the course of his stay where the
patient would forget his location, but could be redirected.
Again, when patient would become confused, concern for
sundowning at night, patient would remove and pull his lines.
Patient required some soft restraints to prevent these.
Eventually patient was started on Seroquel 12.5 b.i.d. which
can be titrated up for further stabilization of patient's
delirium.  Patient was off >.......<medicines and continued
to have these mental status changes, and was otherwise
stable.

14.  Dysphagia:  Patient had repeat speech and swallow
evaluations post extubation with still little improvement in
his swallow function.  Eventually, patient had to have
percutaneous gastrostomy tube placed for nutrition, which was
used for feeding as patient could not take po foods, drinks,
or medications without risk of aspiration.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.  Patient still requires
occasional restraints to help prevent removal of lines,
however, otherwise, well-controlled.  Patient's cardiac
status stable.  Patient [**Year (4 digits) 14976**] and afebrile on
antibiotic regimen which will be completed [**4-3**].
Patient's delirium waxes and wanes.  Patient stable on his
hemodialysis regimen.  Stable right upper extremity AV
fistula, stable right upper extremity swelling.  Stable new
baseline mental status post anoxic injury and embolic injury
to his brain.  Aortic stenosis stable status post
