      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    OF TWO COLONIAL
MORPHOLOGIES.
         ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON
REQUEST..

   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):
...
[**Month (only) 404**]:
[**2181-1-2**] CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left thigh hematoma, involving the sartorius and rectus
femoris muscles.
.
2. Hazy appearance of the subcutaneous fat possibly also
representing a small hematoma along the left lower chest/upper
abdominal wall.
.
3. Anasarca.
.
[**2181-1-20**] CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Again seen is a soft tissue fluid collection adjacent to the
left hip, consistent with the hematoma noted on prior study.
Additionally, there is a new hematoma within the right rectus
muscle, measuring 7.7 x 6.2 cm, and a tiny focus of hemorrhage
within the left rectus muscle, both at the level of the sacrum.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right, unchanged
from prior study.
3. There is asymmetric enlargement of the left psoas muscle.
This is of uncertain etiology, though this is unchanged from
prior studies dating back to [**2181-12-19**].


Brief Hospital Course:
In Brief: 76 year old woman with MMP including old MCA stroke
presents with right simple partial seizure and respiratory
distress, extensive hospital course complicated by tracheostomy
tube, ventilator associated pneumonia and spontaneous bleeds in
light of anticoagulation for [**Month/Day/Year 1291**].
.
In the ED she was evaluated by Neurology and found to be having
multiple brief eposides of facial twitching that lasted about 30
seconds, but she was able to follow commands during this time
and her speech was more dysarthric than usual. Between episodes,
pt is alert, following commands,with R facial droop, still able
to close R eye, and with slightly dysarthric speech. Speech is
much more dysarthric during the events.
.
She was given ativan 2 mg IV and loaded with Dilantin 20mg./kg
on tele to watch for hypoptension and arrythmias. She was noted
to be in respiratory distress on 5 liters by nasal cannula, and
she was initially considered for MICU admission w/ neuro consult
but she improved to 3L NC after nebs, lasix 80 x 1 and brief
period of nitro gtt, which was stopped b/c of hypotension.
She was also given levofloxacin for presumed UTI and urine cx
was also sent
;
She was reloaded on dilantin with 1500 and again with 500 at 1
pm. Despite this, she continues to seize every 10 minutes.
Subsequently, the MICU was called because the patient was
desatting and gurgling with worsened mental status. Of note, the
patient's BNP was found to be 4461 and her troponin was noted to
be 0.05 which is at her baseline considering her renal failure.
Patient was subsequently intubated.

Of note, at baseline - pt is able to carry on basic
conversation, walks with help, feeds self, knows and socializes
with the staff at home.
.
# Simple partial seizures: Per son, patient has not seized in 20
years. She had been treated with dilantin in the past. We
initially treated her with dilantin. Depakote and keppra were
later added on, but untimately she was treated with a single
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] (keppra 1000mg QD), with good control of her seizures.
Workup revealed no mass lesion or new stroke. EEG showed no
evidence of grand mal seizures.  Patient continued to be
assymptomatic on Keppra for the duration of her stay until [**1-27**].
 Pt did not show any focal neurological deficits.
.
# Altered mental status: Was off baseline, has baseline aphasia.
 The possibility of her returning to her baseline mental status
is unclear given a two-month ICU stay with multiple psychotropic
medicines.  It is likely she will require weeks to clear a
toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
.
# Unresponsiveness: She was slow to regain respnsiveness after
sedation weaned down post intubation. Head CT was again negative
for new bleed. Toxic metabolic workup unrevealing. Patient
slowly regained neurological function untitl she was back to
baseline.  Patient was subsequently sedated while on the
respirator.  She remained on fentanyl drip and versed drip as
she was visible uncomfortable with grimace during her care at
the ICU.  During sedation wean periods patient's functional and
responsiveness status did not change or increase significantly
except for more frequent grimaces that were interpreted to be
signs of discomfort.  Her sedation was weaned off prior to
discharge to rehab.  She was treated with a Fentanyl patch of 25
mcg/hr and with Fentanyl boluses prn.  Her mental status at the
time of transfer to discharge was minimal.  She only grimaces to
pain no other clear responses.
.
# Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for airway protection
and aspirtation risk. She also has had episodes of apnea. She
has evidence of right elevated hemidiaphragm on CXR, perhaps
secondary to ligation of phrenic nerve during sternotomy. She
was treated with nebulizer combivent for wheeziness. One attempt
at extubation on [**2182-12-14**] failed secondary to stridor/worry of
laryngeal edema. She was reintubated and started on a short
course of prednisone. Patient subsequently underwent
tracheostomy.  She continued to have great oxygenation while on
the ventilator.  Patient required persistant AC support, however
after aggressive diuresis with CVVH as described below, she is
tolerating PS well.  Patient eventually was placed back on AC
after an episode of tachypnea and aggitation.  Patient
subsequently had volume overload and PNA complicating her
pulmonary issues.  She was continued on MDIs to maximize her
pulmonary function.  She was then weaned to pressure support
with a pressure setting of 15 and PEEP of 8 prior to discharge.
It would be our plan to continue with PSV weaning.
.
# CHF exacerbation: She has h/o diastolic dysfunction. Dry
weight is 180 per son. Echo [**2-3**] showed EF 55%. Followed
previously by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17976**] at [**Hospital1 756**] but has not been seen
by cardiology in a while. Unknown precipitant to the
exacerbation but per son, she started wheezing 2 weeks ago.
Ruled out for MI. Intermittant diuresis with lasix. Treated with
Beta blocker and ACE inh (held during concern for airway edema).
Echo on [**2181-12-11**] showed moderately dilated left and right
atrium,
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, questionable mildl
depressed LV function (estimated ejection fraction ?50%), mild
to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral
regurgitation, Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation, mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Patient continued to be
grossly volume overload.  Cardiology and Renal service were
consulted and patient was started on CVVH with a goal of
returning the patient to her dry weight while diuresing 30 L.
Patient continued to tolerate the diuresis well.  Her edema did
improve after CVVH edema (+1 pitting at lower extremities).
Patient however by that point was requiring levophed to support
her pressures, likely in part secondary to adrenal
insufficiency.  Her levophed was weaned once the steroids were
switched to IV.  Her CXR showed only mild improvement in her
edema.  It was determined that she was no longer a CVVH
candidate.  She was treated with Lasix and Metalazone prn for
fluid overload.  At the time of transfer to rehab she was on
200mg Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and Metalazone.
.
# BP/hypotension: Patient had multiple episodes of hypotension
while in the MICU.  DDx included acute blood loss into L
thigh/rectus abdominus, vs infection/sepsis vs cardiogenic. CVP
elevated although patient +30L during her stay, no EKG changes
or CE elevations to suggest cardiac etiology.  Patient was
treated for PNA with ABX.  Her hct was also closely followed and
her blood products were repleted.  Patient had known spontaneous
bleeding into R sided rectus abdominus x 2 around the sacral
area and also L thigh bleed.  Patient was resuscitated with
multiple blood products and IVFs to prevent hypotension.
Patient also required intermittent doses of Levophed to keep her
BP elevated during CVVH.  Her BP was monitored through an
A-line.  Patient continues to require levophed for her BP
support.  She has been treated on an extensive course of
meropenem/levoquin and vanco well past the course originally
designated for her known cultures of MRSA sputum on [**1-2**] and
Enterobacter in her sputum on [**1-5**].  The antibiotics were
continued due to persistant and increasing levophed requirement
and leukocytosis.  Patient was also treated with several times
for adrenal insufficiency and a repeat AM cortisol was only 15.6
on [**1-27**].  Patient was subsequently started on high dose
steroids.  She was weaned off all pressors.  She was placed on
Solumedrol for continued steroid support based upon her adrenal
insufficiency.  On transfer to Rehab she is on Solumedrol 20mg
TID which should be weaned slowly over the next several
weeks-months.  She should be re-evaluated for adrenal
insuffiency at that time.
.
# MRSA and ENTEROBACTER PNA.  Patient with persistent
leukocytosis and bandemia.  RUL PNA on [**1-11**] that persists.  MRSA
on [**1-2**] Sputum & Enterobacter on [**1-5**] Sputum.
Patient initialy scheduled for 2 week Meropenem and Levo [**1-9**] -
14 days) for Enterobacter but continue for persistant
leukocytosis.  Patient was also continued on empiric Vancomycin
for empiric line/HD coveragte. Central lines were resited
multiple times.  On [**1-29**] the Vancomycin was discontinued after 3
weeks.  On tranfer to rehab she will require continued Meropenem
and Levo for a full 6 week course.
.
# CAD: Patient never had active Chest Pain. Troponin mildly
elevated upon admision but has been elevated in the past and
continued to trend down.  Her CK-MB remained flat. Patient was
initially continued on her Plavix, Beta blocker, Zocor. Her BB
was d/c in light of hypotension.  Her plavix was d/c after her
second spontaneous bleeding episode involving L thigh bleed.
Patient EKG did not show any new ischemic changes.  In the
meantime patient was continued on heparin gtt for her [**Month/Day (4) 1291**].
.
# Rate - Afib with brief intermittent RVR.  Etiology: likely
sepsis vs. hypovolemia vs. electrolyte abnormalities vs.
hypercarbia.  Patient's RVR was controlled with amiodarone.  In
the meantime she was continued on heparin gtt for her [**Month/Day (4) 1291**].
.
# [**Month/Day (4) 1291**]: Held coumadin as INR supratherapeutic on admission.
Started on Heparin drip for anticoagulation, with plan to
transition back to coumadin.  After her spontaneous bleeding
episodes she was kept on a tight PTT scale of 40-60.
.
# UTI: H/o levo-resistent UTI in [**2-3**] that required CTX, treated
with ceftriaxone until sensitivities showed cipro effective so
continued on cipro only for seven day course. Repeat U/A and
Urine culture after treatment were negative for infection.
.
# ARF: Elevated Cr to 1.9 which returned closer to baseline with
fluids (1.3), likely prerenal based on her urine lytes.  Patient
underwent a week long course of CVVH for removal of fluid that
she tolerated well with support of levophed.  Patient's
subsequent baseline appears to be at 1.9-2.0 with hypotension
requiring pressors, chronic DM, HTN playing a role.  Renal
service didn't believe hemodialysis was indicated giving the
grim condition of the patient.  She is currently on Lasix and
Metolazone for continued diuresis.
.
# DM: We continued her usual regimen of NPH 6qAM and 8qPM with
sliding scale, titrated to fingersticks of 80-100, but then put
her on an insulin drip on ce prednisone was started.  Patient
was subsequently transition back to NPH insulin based upon a
high insulin drip requirement she was started on NPH 25 [**Hospital1 **] with
sliding scale coverage.
.
# anemia: iron studies normal and B12 and folate WNL. Patient
had intermittent blood loss into her spontaneous bleed in rectus
abdominus x 2 and also L thigh requiring aggressive PRBC
resuscitation.  Vascular surgery was involved but since patient
was adequately resuscitated with cessation of blood requirements
after 24-48 hours, no intervention was awarranted.  Patient's
Hct was kept >28.
.
# s/p old stroke: we continued her aspirin and plavix. Plavix
was d/c due to persistant spontaneous hemotomas as described
above.
.
# hypothyroidism: We continued her home dose of levothyroxine.
.
# GERD: She has h/o GIB requiring hospitalization. Treated with
lansoprazole per NGT/PO 30 qd.
.
# h/o primary biliary cirrhosis and gallstones: Stable. We
continued ursodiol
.
# h/o depression and post partum psychosis:
- held risperdone and prozac given unresponsiveness and desire
to decrease mediaction interactions.
.
# healthcare decision: MULTIPLE meetings were held with the
family with a variety of attendings, the hospitals ethics
support service and leagal staff.  Some of the care team at
times felt the sons hopes of recovery were not realistic and
were uncomfortable in providing care that they felt was just
hurting the patient.  My most recent discussions have focused on
explaining Ms. [**Known lastname 17977**] multi-organ system failure and her poor
overall prognosis and assuring them that if it was in fact the
patients wish to persue continued aggressive care, we would do
so.  They understand her high risk for nosocomial disease (vent
associated pneumonia, UTI, line infection, skin breakdown etc)
and still wish to have her sedation lightened so they can
communicate with her.  I explained that as long as she is not
experiencing pain, that is a reasonable goal.
