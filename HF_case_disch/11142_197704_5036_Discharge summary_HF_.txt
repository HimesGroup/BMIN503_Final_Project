Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
female with a history of hypertension without presented to
[**Hospital1 69**] with congestive heart
failure.

The patient initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with
severe dyspnea and respiratory distress after one to two
weeks of fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite.  She also
had shortness of breath for one to two weeks.  She denied
chest pain, fevers, chills, lower extremity edema, orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or weight change.

At [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient was given Lasix, morphine,
nitroglycerin, aspirin, and ceftriaxone.  She was placed on
continuous positive airway pressure with an arterial blood
gas of 7.32/43/110.  No electrocardiogram changes were noted.

At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient's oxygen
saturation was initially 99% on a nonrebreather mask, with a
heart rate of 85, and a blood pressure of 112/50.  The
patient received Lopressor 25 mg, lisinopril, and Zoloft.
She was started on a heparin drip when her troponin T came
back at 0.26.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diastolic congestive heart failure.
3.  Status post hysterectomy.
4.  Status post thoracotomy.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Depression.
7.  Glaucoma.
8.  Irritable bowel syndrome.
9.  Osteoporosis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zestril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Atenolol (dose unknown).
3.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Ambien 2.5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep as needed.
6.  Calcium.
7.  Vitamin D.
8.  Zoloft.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco or ethanol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 99.3 degrees
Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 64, her blood pressure was
140/82, her respiratory rate was 24, and her oxygen
saturation was 88% on 2 liters and 94% on 4 liters.  In
general, the patient was alert and oriented.  In no apparent
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the neck was supple.  Jugular venous distention at 4
cm to 5 cm.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The pupils were
irregular.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lung
examination revealed diffuse crackles bilaterally; expiratory
wheeze.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
There were positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination
revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.  Pulses were
2+ throughout.  Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 10.3, her
hematocrit was 37.1, and her platelets were 202.  Her INR was
1.1.  Partial thromboplastin time was 24.4.  Her prothrombin
time was 12.6.  Chemistry-7 was normal.  Liver function tests
were normal.  Creatine kinase was 183.  Troponin T was 0.26.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed
congestive heart failure with left lower lobe
collapse/consolidation and bilateral effusions.  There was an
opacity in the left mid zone consistent with pneumonia versus
asymptomatic pulmonary edema.

An echocardiogram from [**2108-2-18**] revealed an ejection
fraction of greater than 65%.  Mild local hypertrophy of
basilar septum.  Normal left ventricular size and function.
Mitral regurgitation of 1+.  Tricuspid regurgitation of 1+.
Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

A stress test from [**2103-1-18**] revealed no angina or
ischemic changes.

An electrocardiogram revealed T wave inversions in V1;
otherwise, no acute ST-T wave changes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was initially admitted to the floor.

A cardiac catheterization was performed when the patient
ruled in for a myocardial infarction via enzymes.  The
catheterization was notable for clean coronary arteries.

Following the patient's cardiac catheterization, she
experienced an episode of hypotension with a systolic blood
pressure in the 80s to 90s.  Her hematocrit notably dropped
from 37.1 to 29.4.  She was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for stabilization.  Her blood pressure was stabilized
with intravenous fluids and 2 units of packed red blood cells
at that time.  She then underwent a computerized axial
tomography which was notable for right apical scarring and
calcification, patchy consolidation in both lung bases;
consistent with pneumonia and small effusions, and mildly
distended gallbladder with stones.  A right-sided 12-cm X
9-cm hematoma was noted to extend up the abdominal wall to
proximal to the liver, displacing the bladder.  Areas were
consistent with ongoing bleeding.

The patient's vital signs remained stable.  She was started
on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of her
pneumonia.  A central line was placed for improved access.
Her hematocrit was checked every six hours.  On the third
night of the patient's admission, she was noted to have a
decrease in her hematocrit from 30.9 on [**1-12**] to 24.1
on [**1-14**].  She was transfused another 2 units of packed
red blood cells at that time.

The patient was transferred to the floor after receiving the
packed red blood cells.  An echocardiogram on [**1-14**] was
notable for new wall motion abnormalities.  A repeat chest
x-ray showed improvement in the patient's congestive heart
failure, and there was no new pneumonia.  She was continued
on her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor for blood pressure
control.  A urinalysis and urine culture were performed to
identify the source of the patient's continued low-grade
fevers.  The urinalysis was clean, and the urine culture was
still pending at the time of this dictation.  A blood
cultures was also drawn through the patient's central line
which was negative as of the time of this dictation.

Of note, Vascular Surgery was consulted and recommended a
right femoral ultrasound to rule out pseudoaneurysm.  This
study was negative for a pseudoaneurysm.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's hematocrit had
remained stable at 35 and is still being checked every eight
hours.  The patient was noted to have loose stools times four
on [**1-15**], and her stool was sent for Clostridium
difficile.  This was still pending at the time of this
dictation.  In addition, the patient was noted to have slight
hyponatremia which was consistent with mild syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.
