[**2108-7-9**] BCx: NGTD
.
[**2108-7-9**] C. diff positive
.
[**2108-7-9**] UCx - Skin contamination
.
[**2108-7-9**] CXR: compared to [**2108-6-28**]: 1. Bilateral large pleural
effusions unchaged on left and larger on right, and bibasilar
opacities. This could reflect a combination of atelectasis and
effusion; however, a concomitant infection in this region cannot
be excluded. 2. Mild volume overload.
.
[**2108-7-12**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**7-11**], the degree of
left pleural effusion has decreased while the pleural fluid on
the right has increased and now extends into the minor fissure.
Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. There is continued elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure, though this appears to be somewhat
less than on the prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, diagnosed with
recurrent C. diff colitis.

# Clostridium difficile colitis: Patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and fluid resuscitated. Clostridium difficile toxin was
positive. Patient was started on oral vancomycin and IV
metronidazole with improvement of her diarrhea. IV metronidazole
was discontinued after transfer out of the ICU. Patient was kept
on oral vancomycin on the floor with a plan to do a gradual
tapering regimen of PO vancomycin. Her diarrhea had resolved at
the time of discharge.

# Bilateral pleural effusions: Chest x-ray showed bilateral
pleural effusions with the right side appearing loculated.
[**Name (NI) **] son declined a chest CT despite being informed of the
potentially fatal risks of an untreated empyema. Son is willing
to follow up with patient's primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
respiratory status remained stable throughout the admission
without any fever, coughs, or persistent dyspnea.

# Possible urinary tract: Mild pyuria on urinalysis. Patient was
started on empiric ceftriaxone, which was discontinued once
urine culture returned negative.

# Lethargy: Patient was intermittently lethargic and confused on
admission.  With fluid resuscitation and treatment of
Clostridium difficile, patient's mental status improved
significantly, with no focal neurologic deficits on exam.

patient's son decline warfarin and only wanted aspirin. After
discussion among the son and the ICU team, she was given aspirin
325 mg daily.

# Status post right femur fracture: Patient was operated on by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] in [**2108-2-29**] for a right femur fracture. During

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the emergency room with fever and diarrhea.
Work up showed that you had Clostridium difficile colitis. You
were treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. The IV
metronidazole was discontinued when you were transferred out of
the ICU. On the floor, you were continued on oral vancomycin.
Please continue with oral vancomycin as instructed. You were
found to have a likely infected pleural effusion. However, after
discussion between your family and the medical team, your family
decided not to get a chest CT to work this up further, with a
clear understanding of the potential risks of an untreated
infected pleural effusion.

any other concerning symptoms.


Followup Instructions:
