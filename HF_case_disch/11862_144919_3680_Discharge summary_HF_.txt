Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R hip arthroplasty for R femoral neck fracture on [**2128-7-21**]
Blood transfusions


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 16642**] is a 74-y/o gentleman with CAD (s/p CABG), h/o
mechanical AVR for aortic regurgitation (on home Coumadin),
chronic systolic/diastolic CHF [**1-24**] ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p
ICD placement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who now
presents from [**Hospital6 33**] after he was admitted there
after a fall.

Patient reports he was walking his dog at night, after his usual
4oz alcoholic beverage, when he began to feel \"dizzy\". When
asked about what this means, he reported \"things just went
black\" and he felt as though he was going to pass out. He tried
to find a place to sit but stumbled and fell inside his garage
with concrete floor. Denies any loss of consciousness or head
trauma. Reports he tried to protect his head with his hands but
has no pain anywhere other than his hip. Denies any preceeding
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, double vision or
difficulty breathing.

Of note, patient had gone to see his cardiologist 3 dayst PTA
and had been re-started on Digoxin and had his dose of
metoprolol decreased to 50mg daily.

In [**Hospital6 **], patients vitals were Temp 98.6, HR 70,
BP 76/50 and RR 14, O2 Sat 99% on room air. Portable AP films of
the hip revealed an acute, subcapital hip fracture on the right,
with significant proximal migration of the femur with respect to
the femoral head. INR at admission was 4.3, Hct 27.3, Creatinine
1.8. EtOH level of 78mg/dl. CK 180, CK MB 4.1 and Tn T 0.02.
Patient received 2 units of PRBC, total 7.5mg Vitamin K. Has not
received pressors, #18 and #20 gaugue PIV. Foley catheter was
placed. CT Scan of head and abdomen were obtained, with the
latter only pertinent for a small hernia in the periumbilical
region containing a short segment of small intestine. CT pelvis
revealed acute right hip fracture with extensive soft tissue
contussion adjacent to the right hip with small associated
hematoma. Orthopedic surgery was consulted and decision to
pursue hip arthoplasty once coagulopathy was resolved was
formulated. Patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as he has
obtained most of his care here.

[**2128-7-18**] Pelvis AP XR - Single frontal radiograph of the pelvis
demonstrates a displaced and angulated fracture of the right
femoral neck. Fracture is displaced 0-25% of the width of the
femoral neck. There is external rotation of the distal fracture
fragment and proximal displacement of the distal fracture
fragment. The left hip is unremarkable. The sacroiliac joints
and symphysis pubis are normal.
Surgical staples project over the right groin and vascular
calcifications
project over the low pelvis and left thigh.
[**2128-7-19**] Echo - The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
[**2128-7-19**] CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2128-7-19**] Lumbosacral spine - Marked lumbar spondylosis without
spondylolisthesis. Right femoral neck fracture, better seen on
recent hip radiographs.
[**2128-7-19**] CT Head - IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or
hemorrhage.
[**2128-7-20**] Stress MIBI - No anginal symptoms or ECG changes noted
from baseline. Nuclear report sent separately. ; 1. Fixed,
severe perfusion defects at the inferior and inferolateral
walls. Global hyponkinesis and septal dyskinesis  2. The
calculated LVEF is 36% and the LV-EDV is 149mL.
[**2128-7-22**] CT Abd / Pelvis -
1. Moderate hematoma involving the right gluteal muscles in this
patient
status post right hip replacement.
2. Thickening of the cecum and ascending colon. Differential
diagnosis
includes ischemia, infection and inflammatory causes.
3. Small epigastric hernia containing small bowel. No evidence
for small-
bowel obstruction.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and septal thickening are
consistent
with CHF.
CT Right Lower Extremity - [**2128-7-28**] - Large predominantly
intramuscular hematoma involving the right gluteal muscles and
anterior thigh musculature as above. Without IV contrast, we
cannot
assess for active bleeding/extravasation.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr [**Known lastname 16642**] is a 74 y/o M w h/o CAD (s/p CABG), aortic
regurg (s/p mechanical valve replacement), chronic combined
systolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 45%) [**1-24**] ischemic CMP s/p ICD
placement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who originally
presented w fall and was diagnosed with R hip fracture. He was
transferred to BIMDC on [**2128-7-18**] for R hip ORIF. His course has
been complicated by post-op bleeding in the setting of required
anticoagulation for the presence of a mechanical valve. The
bleeding resulted in a R gluteal hematoma, hypotension (resolved
with fluid resuscitation), acute anemia (treated with
transfusions), ARF and transaminits (likely [**1-24**] to hypoperfusion
of kidney/liver).
.
#. Hip Fracture / Trauma / Hematoma: Imaging was repeated on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], which confirmed right hip fracture. Due to
complain of neck pain, CT c-spine was performed and did not
reveal any concerning findings. Given history of mechanical
aortic valve, anticoagulation with heparin drip was re-initiated
and cardiology consult was obtained for pre operative
assessment. Stress test was obtained and revealed fixed deficits
without reversible ischemia. Patient underwent successful hip
arthroplasty on [**2128-7-21**], and heparin drip was restarted 6 hours
post procedure. While in the ICU, the patient did have a
noticeable Hct drop following anticoagulation, but had an
appropriate Hct bump after being transfused 2UPBRCs. Following
this, the patient was transferred to the floor with stable Hct's
until the morning of [**2128-7-28**] when the patient's Hct was noted to
drop from 27.3 --> 23.3. In addition to this, the patient's
blood pressure was lower than usual (baseline SBP in the 90's).
On examination, R gluteal hematoma was found and confirmed with
CT imaging. The pt was transferred back to the MICU and received
total of 4units pRBCs while in MICU. Hct has been stable, thus
restarted heparin gtt on [**2128-7-31**]. [**Date Range 1957**] has been following to
eval for compartment syndrome and wound infection, doing serial
exams to ensure no foot drop or other concerning findings. On
discharge, surgical wound healing well with no complications.
Followup with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] scheduled.
.
#. Fall / Syncope: History was very suggestive of syncopal
episode, with prior history of orthostatic hypotension and
recent medication change (may have predisposed to medication
error). Differential diagnosis however includes non perfusing
arrhythmia, myocardial infarction (leading to arrhytmia), acute
valvular disease (although highly unlikely with normal exam),
massive pulmonary embolus, and seizure. Patient was ruled out
for MI, had a CT with old cerbellar infarct and ECHO without
significant change from prior. ICD was interrogated and no VT/VF
episodes had been detected. Fall likely secondary to orthostatic
hypotension. Nitrates, [**Last Name (un) **] (ACE-I allergic) were held, low-dose
BBl was continued.
.
#. Acute anemia: In setting of fracture and extensive hematoma,
as above, patient responed appropiately to blood transfusions.
.
#. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: Appears stable. Given relative
hypotension on admission, we held antihypertensives with
exception of metoprolol. We continued aspirin 81mg and statin,
but held nitrate, [**Last Name (un) **] and spironolactone.
.
#. Coronary Artery Disease: Extensive burden of disease,
although patient is currently asymptomatic. pMIBI negative for
reversible ischemia. Aspirin, atorvastatin and metoprolol
continued.
.
# Chronic syst/diast CHF, fluid overload: Pt received copious
amounts of IVFs while hypotensive and became severely volume
overloaded (dependent edema), which made physical therapy
difficult. Pt was started on bumetanide and treated with a dose
of 2mg PO BID for aggressive diuresis. His heart failure regimen
metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID, spironolactone 12.5mg PO daily,
atorvastatin 80mg PO daily were continued. No ACE for now given
ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) **] given ARF earlier, consider restarting as an
outpatient. No nitrates for now.
.
# Mechanical Aortic Valve: Heparin drip restarted in the MICU,
after pt's Hct stabilized. Coumadin restarted very cautiously on
[**2128-8-2**], however, having trouble increasing INR, so Coumadin
increased to 6mg PO daily for now. Needs to be increased to an
INR goal of 2.5-3.5, with heparin bridge to cover in the interim
period.
.
#. Afib: Patient's rate has been controlled with a low dose beta
blocker and he has not had a significant bp drop from this
either. We discussed possibly starting Coreg as it would be
better for his cardiac health, however, we deferred this change
until his anti-coagulation and bleeding issues have been further
resolved. He is currently on heparin. Coumadin was held for
bleeding issues and surgery, restarted on [**8-2**].
.
#. Acute Renal failure: Baseline Cr ~1, pt developed ARF [**1-24**]
hypoperfusion vs ATN in the setting of hypotension from
hemorrhage. Peak Cr 2.1, downtrended gradually to baseline of 1.
ARF resolved completely by discharge.
.
#. RUQ Pain/Transaminitis: On POD #3, RUQ tenderness on exam in
the MICU. LFTs elevated ALT-82, AST-104, ALKPHOS-301 on [**7-26**],
downtrending afterwards, but peaking again ALT=165, AST=137,
ALK=402. Possible shock liver from hypotension from bleeding.
RUQ U/S showed absent GB (s/p cholecystectomy), no ductal
dilation/stones. Pt has no abd pain and no tenderness on exam,
LFTs downtrending on discharge.
.
# Delirium/Confusion: After the operation, the pt became
disoriented with slowed speech, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Etiology likely drug related (pt very susceptible to narcotics
per wife) vs possible ICU delerium. Head CT on [**8-14**], [**7-19**]
with no evidence of bleed or interval change. All cultures are
NGTD, unlikely infectious process. Pt's mental status improved
since transfer to floor, however, still waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. AOx3
on discharge. Recommend avoidance of narcotics/sedative (used
tramadol prn for pain and haldol prn for hyperactivity or
agitation).
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: After the surgery, the pt had low grade
temps to 99-100. Unlikely PE (pt not tachycardic, on heparin
drip, R unilateral LENIs negative), CXR neg for aspiration,
blood and urine cx's show NGTD. RUQ U/S neg for
choledocholithiasis. Patient finished levo/vanc 10 day course on
[**2128-7-31**]. He was also started on keflex for ?cellulitis around
groin site. He then spiked a fever on [**2128-8-1**] to 100.5. He was
pan-cultured and had no change in his CXR from [**2128-7-28**]. He has
had a RIJ line since [**2128-7-21**] and this may be source, so it was
d/c after peripheral access was attained. Pt also developed an
asymptomatic UTI by UA and culture (growing pan-sensitive
Pseudomonas), however, he was not started on abx given that he
did not spike a fever and did not become hemodynamically
unstable.
