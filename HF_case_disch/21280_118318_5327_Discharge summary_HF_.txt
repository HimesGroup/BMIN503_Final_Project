Date of Birth:   [**2114-8-15**]     Sex:  M

Service:  F-ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 44 year old
male with a past medical history for aortic valve
endocarditis status post aortic valve replacement with
debridement and repair, systolic and diastolic congestive
heart failure, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation,
chronic ventilator dependent secondary to Intensive Care Unit
myopathy and neuropathy, chronic Pseudomonal colonization,
and hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.  He was discharged
from the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care
Unit on [**3-27**], after a six month hospitalization for
Pseudomonas pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, TJ tube
placement, pancreatitis, and hypercalcemia.  The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Rehabilitation.

One day later, the patient presented to [**Hospital6 3874**] with explosive vomiting.  He was noted to be febrile
and hypotension to systolic blood pressure in the 90s, with
baseline blood pressure in the low 100s.  His sputum was
positive for Pseudomonas.  At [**Hospital6 3872**], the
patient received one week of antibiotic therapy with
gentamicin.  He was weaned off of pressors after one week.
Tube feeds were held and the patient was evaluated by the
Gastrointestinal and Surgery Department.

Upper endoscopy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7640**], showing a polyp
in the stomach, and otherwise normal.  An abdominal CT scan
was done, showing gallstones and small ascites.  The patient
was sent back to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diastolic congestive heart failure, valvular disease
secondary to aortic valve endocarditis with abscess.  Status
post aortic valve repair, aortic root debridement. Left
ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, four plus
mitral regurgitation and three plus tricuspid regurgitation.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2158-10-29**] ( saphenous vein graft to

4.  History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting
of endocarditis.
5.  Chronic ventilator dependence.
6.  Chronic Pseudomonal colonization.
7.  Hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.  PTH is low, 25
hydroxy Vitamin D levels are low and PTH RP levels are
negative. A bone scan was done showing increased uptake in
the left shoulder, where on x-ray the patient was noted to
have a calcified appearing mass.  Subsequent CT scan guided
biopsy of this calcified mass in the left shoulder revealed
evidence of heterotopic calcification.  The patient has been
treated with intravenous fluids, diuretics and Calcitonin for
his hypercalcemia, and ultimately responded to Pamidronate
after eight treatments.  The patient has also had Vitamin D
levels aggressively repleted.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Our impression is that
this a 44 year old male with multiple medical problems
presenting with explosive vomiting.  The patient had been
previously evaluated for his vomiting being secondary to a
mechanical problem with difficulties with his [**Name (NI) **] tube.  As
the patient had previously been evaluated at [**Hospital1 346**], he was transferred back here for
further evaluation.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Recurrent vomiting:  The initial
differential diagnoses for this patient's recurrent nausea
and vomiting included GJ tube dysfunction contributing to
gastric outlet obstruction, other structural causes of
obstruction, for example stricture or ulcer, ischemia or
adhesions at his gastric outlet, versus a functional motility
disorder (for example gastroparesis, gastric dysmotility).

An abdominal x-ray with contrast injected into the J-tube to
assess for feeding tube patency was done, which showed
satisfactory positioning of the tube.

The patient was to have an upper endoscopy done to evaluate
for gastric outlet obstruction; however, the patient's sister
informed the Medical Team that an upper endoscopy had
recently been done about two weeks prior at [**Hospital6 3873**].  Review of those records revealed an enteral
polyp (hyperplastic inflammatory pathology) with no evidence
of gastric outlet obstruction.  Both the G and J tube passed
the gastric outlet and were patent, and were not kinked.

These findings were reassuring for ruling out gastric outlet
obstruction, and indicated a functional motility disorder as
a cause for the patient's recurrent nausea and vomiting.

During his hospital stay, the J-tube was used for feeding and
the G-tube was set to continuos low suction.  Copious amounts
of bilious material were suctioned from the G-tube during the
initial parts of his hospital stay, which diminished, but
persisted throughout the hospital stay.

Tube feeds were initiated and slowly advanced to a goal of 85
cc per hour, with initiation of Reglan 5 mg intravenously
three times a day, with no recurrent episodes of nausea and
vomiting.

At this time, all the appropriate work-up for this patient's
recurrent nausea and vomiting have been pursued and no
further work-up is needed.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was not in overt congestive
heart failure on admission.  He was continued on Lisinopril
for afterload reduction, which was increased from 5 to 10 mg
per G-tube q. day.

3.  PULMONARY:  Recurrent aspiration - the patient was placed
on aspiration precautions.  The patient also has a history of
chronic Pseudomonal colonization.  Repeat sputum culture done
on [**2159-4-10**], revealed two different colonies of
Pseudomonas as well as Enterobacter species.  Although the
patient continued to have copious secretions through his
tracheostomy tube, he was afebrile with normal white blood
cell count throughout his hospital stay; therefore,
antibiotics were not initiated.

With regards to his ventilator settings, the patient was
continued on C-PAP plus pressure support during the day and
AC-ventilation at night for rest.  Current ventilator
settings are as follows:  During the day the patient is on
C-PAP plus pressure support, [**7-3**] with FIO2 of 40%.  At night,
the patient is rested on AC-ventilation with total volume
400, respiratory rate of 20, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 40%.

4.  CHRONIC PANCREATITIS:  The patient was noted to have
pancreatitis of unclear etiology on his prior stay.  Amylase
and lipase levels were trended on the first few hospital days
during this admission and were noted to have decreased from
his prior hospital say.  The patient tolerated tube feeds
well with no abdominal pain.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  a) Hypercalcemia - the patient was diagnosed
with hypercalcemia of unclear etiology on his recent hospital
stay.  Work-up revealed low normal PTH, low vitamin D levels
with PTH RP negative.  A osteocalcin level was normal and
bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated,
possibly suggestive of Paget's Disease.  A biopsy of a soft
tissue mass in the left glenohumeral joint was done, which
was suspect for malignancy.  This region was biopsied which
was negative.

During a recent admission the patient was treated with two
doses of intravenous pamidronate, once with 30 mg and the
second time with 50 mg, and the patient was given Calcitriol
to replete his vitamin D stores, as these were noted to be
low.

During the patient's current hospital stay, calcium on
admission as normal (9.1 corrected to 10.6 with an albumin of
1.9).  Vitamin D levels checked on [**3-24**] were noted to be
low (less than 7.0), so the patient was redosed with high
dose Vitamin D, 10,000 Units, and was to then continue taking
Calcitriol 0.125 micrograms per J-tube q. day.   Pamidronate
is to be dosed every three months (next dose is to be
administered on [**6-24**], and dose should be 50 mg).

b) Diabetes mellitus type 2:  The patient had excellent
glycemic control, with fingersticks ranging from 80 to 120
during hospital stay.  The patient is to be continued on
regular insulin sliding scale.

6.  SEIZURE DISORDER:  The patient was continued on Keppra
with no further episodes of seizure like activity during his
hospital stay.

7.  DEPRESSION:  The patient was continued on Zoloft with the
dose increased to 50 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient was tearful
at times when attempting to communicate, but seemed motivated
to get better.

8.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had an Intensive Care Unit
neuropathy and myopathy.  He was continued on Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy with improving upper and
lower extremity strength throughout his hospital stay.  The
patient had a Passe-Muir valve placed on [**4-12**] and has
been able to say a few words since then.

9.  ACCESS:  The patient had a right arm PICC placed on [**4-7**].

10. NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on total parenteral
nutrition while tube feeds were being held for various
radiographic procedures and while tube feeds were being
advanced to goal.  The patient has now been advanced to goal
tube feeds at 85 cc per hour which he is tolerating well
without nausea or vomiting and the total parenteral nutrition
has been discontinued.

11. COMMUNICATION:  Sister is [**Name (NI) 21706**] [**Name (NI) **], who is a Nurse
Practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 69**].  She
was kept up-to-date on the patient's progress during this
hospital stay.
