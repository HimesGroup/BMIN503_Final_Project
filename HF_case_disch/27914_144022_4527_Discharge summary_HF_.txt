History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with PMH of NIDDM, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, CRI (baseline 4.2), who originally
presented with 3 days of SOB, PND, and orthopnea  but no weight
changes, LE edema, CP, abdominal discomfort, fevers, cough.  Per
family, pt had recent hospitalization at Caritas with similar
symptoms and was discharged after diuresis.  Patient was
compliant with her medications, no dietary indiscretions and no
recent weight changes per family.  In ambulance, patient was
given 80mgIV lasix. In [**Name (NI) **], pt had SBP of 188/100 and sating 100%
on NIPPV, was given additional 40mg IV and started on nitro
drip. Foley was placed without urine output and was admitted to
the ICU for possibly dialysis and BP control.  In ED, cardiology
was consulted and MICU admission suggested as patient did not
put out to lasix.  Renal was consulted for possible emergent
dialysis and line placement.  Pt and family have been having
recent discussions re:dialysis.
.
Patient was admitted to the MICU for urgent dialysis.  However,
patient was diuresed with a lasix drip with diuril priming where
she put out 1L/day.  She also was weaned of her O2 requirement.
However on [**6-18**], patient HCT dropped from 34  to 25.9. No source
of bleeding was found and HCT remained stable.

CXR on [**6-17**]
1.  Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion.
2.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could represent
pleural effusion or subpulmonic effusion. 3.  Patchy opacities
in the right lung base may represent pneumonia. 4.  Retrocardiac
opacity could represent atelectasis and pleural effusion,
however, cannot rule out consolidation.
.
EKG: NSR, LBBB per old records
.
Renal U/S [**6-19**]
1.  Interval development of right upper pole complex solid and
cystic mass,concerning for malignancy.  Another less likely
consideration would include a hemorrhagic cyst.  Further
evaluation with CT of the abdomen and pelvis utilizing renal
protocol (if renal status allows) or MRI is recommended.
2.  Echogenic renal parenchyma bilaterally, likely as a result
of underlying medical renal disease.
3.  Likely right lower pole hyperechoic lesion, which could
represent an
angiomyolipoma.
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
ECHO [**6-19**]
Conclusions:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrialpressure is >20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There are
filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with
Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report of [**2141-8-17**]
(stress echo), the findings are new and c/w a cardiomyopathy. In
the absence of a prominent hisory of systemic hypertension, an
infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid) should be considered.
.
Stress [**2140**]:
his 88 year old woman (Hx LBBB) was referred to the
lab for evaluation. The patient exercised for 6 minutes of a
modified
[**Doctor First Name **] protocol and was stopped for fatigue representing a fair
functional capacity for her age. No neck, arm, back, or chest
discomforts were reporte throughout the procedure. The ST
segments are uninterpretable in the setting of LBBB. The rhythm
was sinus with
occasional isolated PACs and PVCs. Appropriate hemodynamic
response to exercise. IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with
an uninterpretable ECG in the setting of LBBB at the achieved
workload. ECHO report sent separately.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with HTN, DM, CKD who
presented with a CHF exacerbation and hypertensive urgency. Pt's
HTN has been better controlled, fluid taken off, and no longer
requiring supplemental oxygen.
.
1.SOB-CHF exacerbation likely precipitated by uncontrolled HTN.
Echo showed EF ~20%, LV global hypokinesis, 3+MR, 2+TR.
Troponins remained stable and CK's were flat. Elevated troponins
were thought to be secondary to kidney disease.  In the MICU,
patient was started on a lasix drip which she continued on her
transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3.  Patient had a negative fluid balance daily.
Strict I/O's and daily weights were recorded.  The lasix drip
was discontinued and the patient switched to oral lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
which she tolerated well.  Patient was continued on her ASA.
ACEI was increased to 40mg po daily.  Her beta blocker was
changed to Toprol XL 100mg from metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  Diltiazem
was discontinued.  Patient was weaned off O2 in the MICU and did
not require any additional supplemental oxygen.  Cardiology and
Nephrology were consulted this admission and their
recommendations followed. Patient was placed on a diabetic and
low salt diet. Discharge weight was 46.3kg.
.
2.HTN-
Patient was placed on a nitro drip, for which she responded to
and was weaned before she left the MICU.  She was placed on her
home blood pressure regiment, then switched to Toprol XL while
discontinuing the calcium channel blocker.
.
3.CKD-Thought to be likely due to HTN and DM. Cr is at her
baseline (~4), electrolytes remained within normal limits.
Originally, nephrology was consulted to ascess for urgent
dialysis.  However, the patient and her family wanted to hold
off if possible.  Patient was able to be successfully diuresed
with IV lasix and therefore no acute dialysis was needed this
admission.  She was started on CaCO3 as a phosphate binder and
calcitriol.  She had a renal ultrasound which showed medical
renal disease, a suspicious mass at the upper right pole, and a
angiomyolipoma at the lower right pole.  Patient was followed by
nephrology this admission and her creatinine and electrolytes
monitored.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 4849**] is her nephrologist and she will follow
up with him as an outpatient so that she and her family can
decide on a plan of action Re: suspicious renal mass.
.
4.anemia-Patient's baseline is 28-33. This is thought to be due
to CKD, there was question of the patient undergoing a HCT drop
or was this due to mobilization of fluids secondary to diuresis.
 Hct's were trended; HCT remained stable.  The was a guiac+
stool in the MICU.  On the floor, patient did not have any signs
of bleeding. As of [**2147-6-21**] she was guiac negative. Anemia work
up revealed anemia of chronic disease.  Patient will be
continued on epoeitin at her outpatient regiment. Iron was
discontinued as it was not thought to be necessary at this time.
.
5.DM-Patient is on oral hypoglycemics (TZD and glipizide) at
home.  However, these were discontinued during her
hospitalization for concern of worsening/contributing to heart
failure. The glipizide was discontinued as it is renally
cleared. Patient was placed on regular human insulin sliding
scale and finger sticks monitored.
.
6.safety- physical therapy came and assessed the patient.  At
this time patient, at this time, if patient were to be going
home she would be needing home PT services and 24 hour
supervision as she is at high fall risk. However, she will be
going to [**Hospital3 **] facility at the time of
discharge.
