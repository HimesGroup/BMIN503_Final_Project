History of Present Illness:
History from daughter in law and granddaughter.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6302**] is an 82yo Polish-speaking woman with CAD s/p
anterior apical MI, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF ([**2181-5-23**]
EF 50%), s/p PPM and ICD, asthma, and HTN, who presents after
recent hospitalizatiion for anemia with [**Last Name (un) **]/EGD and capsule
study showing small intestinal ulcers, discharged yesterday, who
presents with fever to 38.8.  The son called the patient's house
around noon but the line was busy.  He went to her house and
found the patient lying on the floor in the bathroom next to the
toilet in her own brown stool.  The patient stated that she had
slipped off the toilet.  She denied LOC, head trauma.  The
patient's daughter in law also arrived at the patient's house
and she noted that the patient felt dizzy, short of breath and
wheezy after the fall.  Daughter in law gave her Tylenol #3 and
albuterol.  Noted to have 38.4 fever at home.  Family called Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4844**], the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he told them to go to the ED for
evaluation.  Pt did not want to come to the hospital after most
recent hospitalization.
.
Of note, recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2181-10-10**] - [**2181-10-17**] for GI
bleeding. Transfused pRBC and Hct stable. GI pefromed EGD and
[**Last Name (un) **] which did not show active source of her bleed.  Also had
capsule endoscopy, results pending.  ASA and coumadin held given
bleeding. Her outpt cardiologist wanted to restart ASA after
capsule study results obtained. Capsule study showed:  Non
bleeding ulcer in the small bowel, there is a possible second
ulcer in the small bowel, thought to be likely source of
bleeding.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 101.5 (tmax 103.6 rectal) HR 65  BP
140/60  RR 22 100% on 6 L NC. Labs drawn, notable for elevated
lactate of 3.0, leukocytosis 12.4, anemia 28.2.  UA, Urine
culture, blood cultures pending.  EKG, CXR, CT abd/pelvis
completed.  Given acetaminophen 650 mg x 1, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV x 1, flagyl 500 mg IV x 1, albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
BP trended down from 100s to mid-upper 80s (lowest 86/38). 1.5 L

.
STUDIES:
.
LUE US [**10-26**]:  Negative for DVT.
.
Xray Ankle [**10-25**]:
No previous images. Generalized osteopenia of the visualized
bony
elements. No evidence of fracture or dislocation. The extensive
vascular
calcification suggests underlying diabetes.

.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow Study [**10-24**]:
Penetration into the vestibule with nectar and thin
consistencies. Please refer to the complete report and dietary
recommendations from speech Pathology.
.
Chest US [**10-22**]:
The pacemaker is identified over the left anterior chest wall
and no fluid collection is identified.
.
TTE [**10-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. No
discrete vegetation identified (does not exclude). Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-23**], the distal
inferior wall is now hypokinetic (may be related to image
quality). The severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation are now increased.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**10-19**]:
1. No evidence of free air. Oral contrast has reached the
transverse colon, with no evidence of extraluminal contrast up
to this level. Fat stranding at the duodenum of uncertain
clinical significance. Free fluid in the pelvis and tracking in
the right lower abdominal quadrant. Anasarca.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, more on the right with associated
atelectasis at the lung bases; cannot rule out superinfection.
.
EKG: [**10-18**] NSR @ 60 bpm, paced, prolonged PR interval, nl axis,
no acute ST changes, TWI, Qwaves (no change compared to prior on
[**2181-10-12**].
.
CXR [**2181-10-18**] (FINAL): Radiograph is limited due to rotation and
motion. There are bibasilar plate-like atelectasis. There is
opacty at the right lung base, which could be consolidation, and
correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. Dual-lead pacer device is seen with leads in the
expected locations in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Bones are diffusely osteopenic. Atherosclerotic calcification
along the thoracic aorta is seen. Old right lower posterolateral
rib fracture is less conspicuous on the current radiograph.
IMPRESSION: Limited radiograph due to rotation and motion.
Possible airspace opacity at the right lung base, could be
consolidation, and correlation with clinical exam is
recommended.
.
TTE [**2181-5-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal
septum and anterior walls. The apex is akinetic. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-6-28**] the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
Regional left ventricular systolic function is similar.
.
Colonoscopy [**10-15**]
Normal mucosa in the whole colon
Polyp at a distance between 80 cm and 65 cm in the colon
Polyp at 20cm in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
Endoscopy [**10-11**]
Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy, biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
82 y.o. F with CAD s/p anterior apical MI, chronic systolic and
diastolic CHF ([**2181-5-23**] EF 50%), s/p PPM and ICD, asthma, recent
GI bleed, who presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly
bloody stool in rectal vault.

MICU COURSE:
=============
1. Sepsis: Met [**3-7**] SIRS criteria with possible sources of
infection, including pneumonia given findings on CXR and CT and
phsyical exam findings as well as + UA. Broadly treated with
vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin to treat hospital
acquired pneumonia as well as UTI. Pt initially was hypotensive
and was bolused with IVFs.  CVP at goal and still with
borderline BPs, so levophed was initiated.  This was weaned in
24 hours.  Urine culture with > 100,000 e.coli sensitive to
cefepime.  [**5-5**] Blood culture returned with MRSA bacteremia.  ID
was consulted for MRSA bacteremia.  Vancomycin and cefepime were
continued. Cipro stopped due to no evidence of pseudomonas.
Echo without vegatations or masses.

ID was consulted, and recommended TEE to determine course of
antibiotics plus need for ongoing suppressive antibiotics. This
was not performed in the ICU based on her improving status and
was not done on the floor per family wishes. This required a 6
week  course of Vancomycin, due to worry of pacemaker infection.

Though this was likely a MRSA pneumonia exclusively, she was
continued on cefepime for an 8 day course given lack of
sufficient sputum culture data.

2. Anemia from GI bleeding: Hct 28 and stable from recent
hospitalization. However, grossly bloody stool in rectal vault.
GI consulted and recommended serial Hcts and active T&S.  Pt did
not need transfusions while in the ICU or on CC7 and did not
have any more evidence of GI bleed. Surgery also initially
consulted in ED, but no surgical issues.

3. UTI: + UA with e. coli > 100K. Treated with cefepime.

4. ARF: Elevated to 2.7 on [**2181-10-19**], from baseline around 1.5.
Returned to baseline on [**2181-10-24**]. Likely prerenal, patient has
tenuous volume status with total body overload and intravascular
depletion. I/O total net through hospital stay was negative
4.5-5l. Cr. at baseline on discharge.

5. CAD: Continued atorvastatin, held carvedilol in setting of
hypotension

6. CHF: systolic and diastlic dysfunction in recent echo.
Initially held lasix, carvedilol and isosorbid mononitrate given
hypotension.  As pt improved, IV lasix boluses given as pt
appeared volume overloaded with symptomatic SOB.  Continued
diuresis.

7. Afib: continued amiodarone, monitored on telemetry and had
many EKGs that showed different levels of atrial and ventricular
pacing.

8. HTN: Held antihypertensives initially given
hypotension/sepsis. Restarted carvedilol on CC7 but held
isosorbide mononitrate until discharge.

General medicine floor course:
1. MRSA sepsis: Her IJ line culture was negative. Family
continued to refuse TEE and so patient was kept on 6 week course
of vancomycin for a possible occult pacemaker pocket infection.
She completed an 8 day course of cefepime on [**2181-10-26**]. after
blood cultures were negative x4 no further cultures were drawn.
She was discharged on Vancomycin 100mg IV Q24 with PICC line in
place, to rehab facility in [**Location (un) **], MA. Vancomycin should be
continued through [**2181-11-30**].

2. Anemia: Hct remained stable on floor and no signs of GI
bleeding were seen. Coumadin and ASA were held throughout
hospital stay despite this, as bleeding risk was greater than
risk of staying off anticoagulation with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. The ASA and Coumadin can be considered for
restarting during her rehab stay, pending no further signs of GI
bleeding.

3. UTI: Clear on subsequent culture on [**2181-10-22**]. Cefepime was
continued for 8 day course and stopped on [**2181-10-26**]. Foley was
removed on [**2181-10-25**] and patient had few epsiodes of incontinence
afterwards.

4. ARF: Cr. returned to baseline level, at 1.4, on day of
discharge. Her urine output was adequate during active diuresis
and her initial spike in Cr. did appear to be prerenal related.

5. CAD: Carvedilol and Atorvastatin were restarted before she
came  to medicine floor and were continued on discharge. She was
normotensive throughout and had her isosorbide mononitrate
restarted on [**2181-10-26**]. ASA conitnued to be held due to bleeding
risk and the fact that her MI was in the distant past ([**2172**]).

6. CHF: Both systolic and diastolic. EF on this admission was
40%. Patient was diuresed a total of 4.5-5l throughout this
hospitalization after initial volume support during
sepsis-related hypotension. She came to teh medicine floor on
her home dose of furosemide 40mg and was discharged on this.

7. A Fib: She was placed on telemetry intially, which showed her
to be in AF but without any symptoms. She was AV paced and
removed from telemetry on [**2181-10-25**]. Her amiodarone was continued
throughout, Coumadin was held as described above.  Can consider
re-starting Coumadin and ASA following discharge if no further
GI bleed.

8. HTN: She came to the floor normotensive and on her home dose
of carvedilol. Isosorbide mononitrate was held initially but
restarted on [**2181-10-26**] at her home dose.

9. Lt. UE edema: Most likely venous insufficiency and without
pain but a UE US was obtained to look for possible DVT. This
showed no signs of a clot.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for fever. Initially your blood pressure
was low and you were sent to the intensive care unit and were
given medications to keep your blood pressure at an acceptable
level. you also were found to have an infection in your blood
stream, your lungs, and your urine. After starting antibiotics
these infections cleared but you were kept on 6 weeks of
vancomycin because we wanted to lower the chances of your
pacemaker getting infected.
.
Your kidney function also became worse intially during your stay
but returned to your normal level of function by the time you
got to the general medicine floor. It was thought that this
worsening kideny function was related to your infection and
fluid status.
