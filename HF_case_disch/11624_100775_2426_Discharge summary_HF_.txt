Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo male, initially admitted for SOB/CHF exacerbation;
hospital course discussed by problem.
# Dyspnea- he had been ruled out for a PE by CTA done in the ED.
 The patient appeared to fluid overloaded in likely CHF
exacerbation by exam and by CXR.  The patient was diuresed
effectively with IV Lasix.  He also had a troponin leak up to
.06, peak CK in 300's.  An echo was done which showed global
hypokinesis and an EF of 15%.  Cardiology was consulted, and the
patient underwent a P-MIBI, which revealed LV enlargement and a
mild, fixed defect of inferior wall.  Cardiac cath was discussed
with and subsequently performed on the patient, which
demonstrated no CAD, but severely depressed LVEF.  The patient's
ACE was increased, and a statin, low-dose beta-blocker, and
Lasix were initiated, with an improvement in his symptoms.
Given the patient's low EF, a EP consult was obtained for
possible ICD placement.  Prior to pacer/ICD placement, the
patient underwent a TEE to evaluate for possible atrial
thrombus, none was found.
.
On [**1-11**], the patient had a [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker and ICD
placed, but EP studies on [**1-13**] showed that the RV lead was not
in the correct position. The patient had been started on
anticoagulation for Afib/flutter, so FFP was given to reverse
his INR in preparation for EP re-positioning of RV lead.
However, the patient became acutely SOB and hypertensive while
in EP lab. The patient was intubated and given 40 mg IV Lasix,
and nitroglycerin and the EP procedure was completed. He was
then transferred from to the CCU for CHF and ventilator
management.
.
While in the CCU, the patient the patient became tachy and
hypotensive, required dopamine for 24 hours to maintain
pressure.  Cardiac enzymes were repeated, and an echo was
repeated to rule out tamponade.  The patient improved with
aggressive diuresis, was successfully weaned off pressors and
extubated.  Although the patient had one temperature spike
during the CCU, no infectious source was found, and he received
48 hours of empiric antibiotics following the EP procedure.  The
patient was transferred back to the medicine floor and remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile, with no further episodes of
chest pain or shortness of breath.
.
# CHB- his pacemaker was upgraded to dual chamber [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
pacer along with the ICD. He will be followed in the device
clinic, with his first appointment on [**2147-1-20**].
.
# h/o a-fib/aflutter- He was rate controlled with Lopressor,
titrated up to a dose of 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], given that his blood
pressure tolerates this.  He was also started on Coumadin,
initially mg, titrated down to 2.5 mg every evening.  INR
monitoring will be required on a daily basis to ensure correct
dosing for a target range of 2.0-3.0
.
# L upper extremity edema- Following his stay in the CCU, the
patient's LUE was noted to be edematous and an ultrasound was
obtained which confirmed a DVT.  The patient was already on
Coumadin, but a heparin drip was started as his INR at that time
was subtherapuetic.
.
# hypothyroidism- He was continued on his current dose of
Levoxyl, and thyroid studies were done which showed an elevated
TSH and low free T3, however no medication changes were made
during this acute exacerbation of CHF.
.
# Hypertension- The patient's blood pressure remained well
controlled following the procedure and his stay in the CCU.  A
number of new medications (beta blocker, Lasix, ACE increase)
were started to help optimize his cardiac health, however, these
may need to be tailored to prevent hypotension.  The patient was
ruled out for both tamponade and infection as potential causes
of hypotension.
.
# FEN- The patient was placed on fluid restriction of 1.5L per
day and tolerated a low sodium/cardiac diet well.  His
electrolytes were carefully monitored in the setting of
diuresis, with occasional K+/Mg repletion.
.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy, who recommended
the patient be admitted to a rehab facility.  This was discussed
with both the patient and his family, including his HCP; and he
was subsequently discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for further
rehabilitation.  The patient will need follow-up with the
EP/device clinic as described above.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been started on three new medications that are listed
below.  Please take these and all of your medications as
instructed.  Please DO NOT start taking the warfarin until
tomorrow night.  Warfarin is a medication that keeps your blood

Please call your doctor if you develop any chest pain, shortness
of breath, fevers, chills, or vomiting.
