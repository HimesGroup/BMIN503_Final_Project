Chief Complaint:
fever during dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
interventional radiology hemodialysis catheter removal
interventional radiology tunneled hemodialysis catheter
placement


History of Present Illness:
61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ complicated PMH significant for
type 1 IDDM (s/p revision renal and pancreas transplants, [**2160**]
and [**2174**]), diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E
coli UTIs, chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated
hyperkalemia, who developed fevers during dialysis on [**2181-11-5**].
.
Pt states that she was feeling completely normal up until
dialysis. Over the last three months, she has had a complicated
course w/ multiple admissions, most recently [**Date range (1) 17774**], w/
HCAP and worsening CHF during which she was intubated. Pt has
since been at [**Hospital3 **] since than and recently discharged
to [**Hospital 10246**] Rehab in [**Location 1268**], where she has slowly been
making progress in her recovery.
.
Pt received dialysis on Monday, [**2181-11-5**], as usual and was found
to be febrile and have chills. Dialysis was terminated early.
Per her most recent nephrology note from [**2181-10-29**], her renal
graft seemed to be working better, with Cr 2.0, and a tentative
plan to wean off dialysis. Pt denies any localizing symptoms
prior to Monday.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt was initially not very responisve and triggered on
arrival for altered mental status with fever 103 and HR 130. UA
was bland, UCx and Blood Cx pending. Pt was given Vancomycin 1g,
Levofloxacin 750mg, and Metronidazole 500mg, stress dose
steroids (methylprednisolone 125mg) and fluid bolus (amount not
documented). Pt had a good response w/ lactate correcting from
2.9 to 2.2, HR 90, and marked improvement in mental status. By
report, she had nausea, lower abdominal pain and dysuria. Pt's
CXR was significnat for small bilateral pleural effusions and
interval marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Bedside
Echo did not show any significant pericardial effusion. Pt had a
non-contrast CT abd which showed dilated fluid-filled loops of
small bowel in RLQ and midline pelvis w/ some fecalized loops
concerning for partial small bowel, colon full of stool, and
normal appearing LLQ transplanted kidney. Transplant surgery was
called and had low suspicion for obstruction w/ recommendation
of serial abdominal exams and repeat imaging w/ po contrast if
worsening exam or symptoms. Pt was admitted for fever of unknown
origin workup.
.
On arrival to the floor, Pt's vitals were 99.2F, 117/60, HR 94,
RR 18, sat 100% 2L. Pt has no pain at all, except for a \"sharp
pain\" near her urethra.

ROS: No fevers, no chills (aside from dialysis session on
Monday), no night sweats, no changes in weight. No cough, no
SOB, no chest pain, no palpitations. No nausea, no vomiting, no
diarrhea or constipation. Pt states that she normally has 3 BM
daily and that she has been regular. Her last BM was 4pm 1d
prior to admission.

Past Medical History:
1. diastolic CHF (preserved EF 35%, moderate regional
systolic dysfunction, [**9-/2181**])
2. s/p renal transplant ([**2157**], complicated by chronic rejection,

second transplant [**2160**])
3. s/p pancreas transplant (with allograft pancreatectomy
[**5-/2174**], redo transplant [**6-/2175**], acute rejection [**7-/2180**] which
resolved with increased immunosuppresion)
4. diabetes mellitus type I (complicated by neuropathy,
retinopathy, dysautonomia, no longer requires regular insulin
after pancreas transplant)
5. autonomic neuropathy
6. sleep-disordered breathing (on 2L NC nighttime, unable to
tolerate CPAP)
7. osteoporosis
8. hypothyroidism
9. pernicious anemia
10. cataracts
11. glaucoma
12. anemia from chronic kidney disease (on Aranesp previously)
13. Right foot fracture, complicated by RLE DVT
14. chronic LLE edema
15. Reucrrent MDR E.coli pyelonephritis
16. s/p anal polypectomy ([**5-/2176**])
17. s/p bilateral trigger finger surgery ([**8-/2178**])
18. s/p left [**Year (4 digits) 6024**] ([**8-/2179**])
19. CAD s/p DES to LAD [**9-/2181**]

Social History:
Child psychiatrist, on disability. Lives alone in [**Hospital1 8**], MA,

[**2181-11-5**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Small bilateral pleural effusions. Interval marked enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette relative to the most recent prior
exam. However, other more remote exams have demonstrated
enlargement of the silhouette, thereby suggesting the
possibility of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] pericardial effusion. Correlate
clinically.
.
[**2181-11-6**] Radiology CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON
1. Fluid-filled dilated loopss of small bowel in the right lower
quadrant and midline pelvis with areas of fecalized small bowel
concerning for partial small-bowel obstruction, of uncertain
etiology. Clear transition point is difficult to identify given
the lack of both oral and intravenous contrast. 2. Small right
pleural effusion. 3. Normal appearance of the appendix. 4.
Normal appearance of the transplanted kidney in the left lower
quadrant.
.
[**2181-11-7**] Cardiology ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetation seen. Moderately dilated left
ventricular cavity with moderate global hypokinesis - the
anterior wall and septum have the worst function. Severe mitral
regurgitation. Small ASD/stretched PFO present with left to
right shunting at rest.
.
[**2181-11-7**] Radiology ART [**Month/Day/Year **] (REST ONLY)
FINDINGS: The Doppler waveform in the right common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal arteries is triphasic with
monophasic Doppler waveform at the level of the posterior tibial
and dorsalis pedis artery. The pressures are falsely elevated
due to calcified vessels; therefore, ABI index could not be
obtained. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with significant
posterior tibial disease in the right lower extremity.
.
[**2181-11-8**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: Removal of dialysis catheter with no evidence of
pneumothorax. Heart is mildly enlarged and is accompanied by
vascular engorgement and new septal lines consistent with
interstitial edema. Small pleural effusions have increased in
size in the interval.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ complicated PMH significant for
type 1 IDDM (s/p revision renal and pancraes transplants, [**2160**]
and [**2174**]), diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E
coli UTIs, chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated
hyperkalemia, who developed fevers during dialysis and later
septic shock.
.
Active issues:
.
# Fever: UA bland, UCx pending. CXR w/out infiltrates or
opacities. Blood Cx growing gram negative rods. CT abdomen
concerning for possible obstruction, but Pt currently completely
asymptomatic. No diarrhea, pain or discomfort. R shin initially
concerning for cellulitis, but no obvious skin breaks, and now
completely painless and no longer inflamed. Suspect line
infection but site initially looked clean and uninfected.
Tunneled HD line was removed by IR on [**2181-11-6**], and Pt has
remained afebrile. [**11-5**] blood cultures growing E coli,
sensitive to cephalosporins. Pt was treated w/ meropenem
([**Date range (1) 17777**]) at 500mg [**Hospital1 **] (Pt still making urine) given absence
of clear source and tenuous clinical condition, but this was
discontinued once sensitivities were finalized on [**11-9**] and
switched to ceftazidime per HD protocol. Pt had a replacement HD
catheter placed by IR w/ no complications on [**2181-11-9**]. Although
Pt has a stated allergy to cephalosporins, the purported allergy
is neutropenia, and happened over 20 years ago. Infectious
disease feels that although a marrow suppressive response w/
cephalosporins is not impossible, it is rare, and Pt will be on
a two week course from the day the HD line was removed,
[**Date range (1) 17778**], w/ 2-2-3g dosing w/ HD. Pt can get CBC checks to
ensure she is not having any marrow suppressive effects during
treatment, at which time her antibiotic may be switched back to
meropenem. Avoiding gent to avoid further damage to kidneys.
Pt will need to continue ceftazidime on a 2-2-3g schedule w/ HD
until [**11-20**]. She should continue to have CBCs drawn prior HD to
monitor for neutropenia while on ceftazidime.
.
# dyspnea: likely fluid overload from ICU course vs worsening
mitral regurgitation seen on Echo. CXR on [**11-9**] shows increased
pulmonary vasculature. Attempted diuresis w/ furosemide 80mg iv
but poor response. Pt had complete resolution of symptoms and
exam findings w/ HD.
.
# ? R lower extremity cellulitis: Pt has very tender and
erythematous R shin. No obvious skin breaks, no other signs of
infection. Question of vascular cause. Arterogram shows poor
tibial perfusion. Pt's symptoms have completely resolved without
intervention. Pain and symptoms could have been caused by
hypotension during sepsis exacerbating pre-existing poor
perfusion from peripheral artery disease.
.
# ? SBO: CT abdomen w/out contrast concerning for possible SBO,
but Pt currently w/out any abdominal pain or nausea. Also
reports having had BM recently. Will continue to monitor
clinically.
-consider CT abd w/ po contrast if clinically worsening
.
# peripheral neuropathy of amputation stump: intermittently
symptomatic. Gabapentin 300mg po q48hrs PRN (renally dosed).
.
# CAD/CHF: repeat echo on [**2181-11-7**] shows no vegetations,
moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with moderate global
hypokinesis, especially the anterior wall and septum, severe
mitral regurgitation, and small ASD/stretched PFO present with
left to right shunting at rest. In comparison to echo of
[**2181-10-9**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased to
severe. Estimated pulmonary systolic pressures are significantly
higher. Pt's prior medications of atorvastatin 80mg daily,
clopidogrel 75mg daily, and aspirin 325 mg daily were continued
without issue.
.
# Hyperglycemia: likely secondary to steroid dosing.  Required
only a small amount of insulin as an inpatient.  Continue QID
finger sticks for now with insulin sliding scale coverage.
.
# Diarrhea: Patient had a few loose bowel movements.  C diff was
negative and the diarrhea resolved on its own prior to
discharge.
.
Chronic Issues:
.
# s/p renal transplant: Pt received continue stress dose
methylprednisolone 100mg iv q8hrs for 2 doses, then 60
prednisone mg x 1 d, then 30mg x1, then 15mg x 1d, back to home
dose of prednisone 5mg daily. Pt's other medications including
sirolimus 1.5mg daily, tacrolimus 3mg [**Hospital1 **], sevelamer carbonate
1600mg po tid, and calcium citrate-vitamin d were continued
without issue.
.
# s/p pancreas transplant: Pt's home meds of
lipase-protease-amylase[Creon] 12k, 38k 60k, [**1-25**] capsules tid,
folic acid 1mg daily, famotidine 20mg daily, and acyclovir 200mg
q12hrs were continued without issue.
.
# glaucoma: Prior meds continued, including brimonidine 0.15%
drops tid, cyclosporine 0.05% drops daily, Dorzolamide
2%/Timolol 0.5% Ophth. 1 DROP BOTH EYES QD, and Latanoprost
0.005% Ophth. Soln. 1 DROP BOTH EYES HS.
.
# hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 112mcg M, W, F, Sat. 100mcg Tues
Thurs Sun
.
# anemia: darbepoetin alpha 200mcg/mL iv q 28 days
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Pt should continue to have CBC checks prior to HD to monitor
for neutropenia while on ceftazidime (until [**11-20**]).

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for fevers and rigors during
dialysis. You were found to have a bacterial infection in your
blood and were started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. You then
became septic, had low blood pressure, and were transferred
briefly to the ICU, where you were given fluids and started on
high-dose steroids. Your dialysis line was also pulled because
it may have been the cause of your infection. Your urine did not
show any sign of infection, nor did your chest X-ray. Your
echocardiogram did not show any signs of endocarditis, but your
prior mitral regurgitation has worsened to severe and your
pulmonary hypertension is also worse. When you first came, you
developed right leg pain of unclear etiology. This may have been
due to low blood pressure from sepsis worsening your baseline
poor leg perfusion from your peripheral vascular disease. You
also developed some shortness of breath, likely because you were
fluid overloaded. Your symptoms resolved after you had a new
dialysis catheter placed and were dialyzed. Your blood cultures
eventually grew E coli. You were initially treated with
meropenem, but this was switched to ceftazidime with
hemodialysis to avoid putting another line and potential source
of infection. Although you had a potential drug reaction to a
cephalosporin causing neutropenia, our infectious disease
experts felt that treatment with ceftazidime was the preferred
option due to your brief treatment course of 2 weeks, no need of
another line, and no renal toxicity (as with gentamicin). Your
blood levels will be closely monitored to ensure that you do not
develop neutropenia.  Your stool sample was negative for C diff
infection.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
-START ceftazidime 2g/2g/3g with hemodialysis until [**11-20**].
-INCREASE sevelamer to 1600mg three times daily with meals
Please continue to take your other medications as previously
prescribed.
