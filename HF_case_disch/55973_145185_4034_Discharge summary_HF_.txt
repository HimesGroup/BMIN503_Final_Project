Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
61F with complex med history of failed renal transplant on PD,
numerous hospitalization for sepsis and ICU stays, with severe
immunocompromise ?[**1-24**] ATG and over-immunosuppression, presenting
with lethargy, hypotension, and concern for peritonitis due to
discolored PD fuid. She presents from her rehab with hypotension
and mild changes in mental status. She feels fatigued, but is
alert and oriented.  She also endorses 4 days of liquid stools.
.
Arrived to ED with SBPs in 70-80s, awake. Radial pulse not
easily palpable. Dialysate from overnight dwell that arrived
with her is discolored. Abdomen is soft, catheter site is
clean/dry and nonerythematous. Extremities are warm.  Her
peritoneal fluid was sent for culture, cell counts did not
indicate an infection.  She was bolused 1.5 L of NS total, with
improvement in her BPs to high 90s low 100s.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted from [**5-28**] to [**6-5**] with
hypotension, was aggressively bolused in the ED with 4-5 L, then
had acute decompensated heart failure which improved with fluid
removal from PD.  Before that admission, she was admitted with
GNR bacteremia of an unclear source, discharged on a 2 week
course of meropenem, which was completed on [**6-9**].
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was asymptomatic, comfortable,
blood pressures 109/66, satting 100% 2L.

MICRO:
[**2182-6-15**] Peritoneal fluid Cx: no growth
[**2182-6-15**] Blood Cx: no growth to date
[**2182-6-16**] C. diff: negative
.
IMAGING:
[**2182-6-15**] CXR: The patient is status post mitral valve
replacement and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
The heart is mildly enlarged. There is patchy basilar
opacification suggesting a combination of atelectasis and
pleural effusion. Streaky left upper lobe opacity suggests minor
atelectasis or scarring which is unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax. No free air is demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Patchy left basilar opacity, highly suggestive of
atelectasis in association with a small-to-moderate suspected
pleural effusion, although opacification is not entirely
specific as the etiology.
.
[**2182-6-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis w/o con:
1. Peritoneal dialysis catheter unchanged in position compared
to the prior studies.
2. Small amount of free air in the abdomen, slightly increased
compared to prior study. No clear source identified and this
likely is related to the peritoneal dialysis.
3. Very extensive vascular calcifications.
4. Small shrunken native kidneys consistent with the patient's
end-stage renal failure. A transplant kidney is seen in the left
lower quadrant.
5. Pancreas transplant in the right lower quadrant incompletely
assessed on this non-contrast study.
6. Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, but
no hemorrhagic fluid is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old woman with diabetes s/p pancreas transplant, ESRD
s/p renal transplant x3, currently on peritoneal dialysis,
presenting with hypotension, lethargy, and diarrhea.
.
# Hypotension: Patient with baseline SBPs in the low 90s,
70s/80s on presentation to the ED with mild lethargy. Now
normotensive above her baseline SBPs > 100 after resuscitation
with 1.5 L NS. Her peritoneal fluid per report was discolored,
however cell count and culture both negative for infection.
Blood cultures negative for growth to date. CXR showed
atalectasis but no evidence of pneumonia. Stool negative for C.
diff infection. She was empirically treated with vancomycin and
meropenem to cover for sepsis, however these were discontinued
after all culture data returned negative. She has had several
days of frequent stools, likely due to a viral gastroenteritis,
which may have contributed to dehydration causing hypovolemia
with her continued PD.
.
# Acute Gastroenteritis: Resolved. C diff negative. Likely due
to a viral gastroenteritis.
.
# ESRD on PD: Patient did not appear volume overloaded on
admission. When she started to dwell on the morning of [**6-16**], the
peritoneal fluid was tinged bright red. The hematocrit on that
fluid was less than two percent. Her Hct was stable at 28.  A CT
scan of her abdomen pelvis was obtained and showed that the PD
catheter was in good position and there were no acute
abnormalities. Her subsequent PD fluid has remained clear.
.
# CD4 Count: Patient with recent CD4 count in the 70s, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
(patient's ID doctor) recommended PCP and MAC prophylaxis as
well as HIV test. Patient will need f/u for this as an
outpatient.
.
# Chronic Systolic and Diastolic CHF: Echocardiogram last
admission showed posterior/lateral/inferior/apical hypokinesis
similar to prior but with worsening MR and pulmonary
hypertension. She currently appears euvolemic. She was continued
on amiodarone.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Patient is s/p MI and 5-vessel CABG
in [**1-/2182**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D/OM1/OM2/PDA). She also has severe
mitral regurgitation s/p repair in [**2-3**]. Currently without chest
pain. Continued aspirin and statin.
.
# DM1 s/p pancreas transplant and renal transplant: Tacro level
was 9.6, above the goal ([**3-30**]), therefore the tacrolimus dose was
decreased from 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to 1mg [**Hospital1 **]. Continued prednisone 5mg
daily.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: History of paroxysmal afib. Currently in
sinus rhythm on amiodarone. INR was supratherapeutic at 3.8 upon
admission so coumadin was held. INR decreased to 2.4 on the day
of discharge so the coumadin was restarted at the patient's home
dose.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.
.
# Vitamin B12 deficiency: Low levels despite PO supplementation
suggesting poor absorption, therefore we stopped the PO vitmain
B12 and started IM 1000 mcg once monthly.
.
# Glaucoma: Continued home eye drops and methazolamide.
