Chief Complaint:
CHEST PAIN

Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 50 yo M with history of prior anterior MI s/p
DES to LAD in [**8-29**] who presented to ED after experiencing CP
since 9am and found to have inferior STE. He was working on his
truck this am when he started to have chest tightness and
diaphoresis that felt similar to his prior heart attack. He
rated it as a [**8-4**]. The night prior he said he took an antacid
for what he thought was gas pain. He says he had not taken any
of his medications in 6 months except his aspirin. He had
co-workers call 911.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were  78 118/87 16 100%NRB. Given
nitro, morphine, plavix 600mg, and started on integrillin.

He was taken to cath where he has near occlusion of OM and
underwent export thrombectomy followed by direct stenting with a
3.0x15mm Endeavor, post-dilated to 3.25mm. An LVgram showed EF
in 40% marked LV dysfunction 40% (anterior, apical, and
posterolateral HK). LVEDP ~35-40mmHg. He was started on
intergrillin and had a perclose.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2185-6-28**]:
Heart size normal. Mild peribronchial opacification in the left
mid lung is chronic, probably scarring. No pulmonary edema,
focal pulmonary abnormality or pleural effusion. Pleural
thickening along the left costal margin could be due to fat
deposition or previous trauma.

TTE [**2186-12-12**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, inferior
wall, and apex. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The remaining segments
contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD.

Cath [**2186-12-11**]:
Official report is not availible - but in summary: subtotally
occluded LCx s/p successful intervention with DES. LV gram
suggests EF 40% with regional HK (anterior, apical, and
posterolateral), which compared to most recent echo [**2185**] was
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 50 yo M with history of prior anterior MI s/p
DES to LAD in [**8-29**] who presented to ED after experiencing CP
found to have inferior STE now s/p DES to OM1.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient has history of LAD disease and prior
anterior infarct.  Prior to the event, patient was not adherent
to medications. He has risk factors of prior MI, HL, HTN, and
smoking.  After stentingn to the LCx, he was hemodynamically
stable and was to CCU for monitoring.  He was started on aspirin
325mg, plavix 75mg, Lisinopril 10mg, metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and
atorvastatin 80mg.  His cardiac enzymes were downtrending.
# Pump: Patient has LV dysfunction 40% with anterior, apical,
and posterolateral hypokinesis.  No symptoms of heart failure
and was euvolemic on exam.  He was given instructions on his
diet and was given consulting for smoking cessation.
# RHYTHM: Patient was in sinus for the duration of his
hospitalization.
# Tranaminitis: Likely [**2-27**] myocardial injury, although patient
also says he drinks 6 beers on sundays and with a ratio of 2:1
(ast:alt) may be hepatic injury [**2-27**] alcohol.  His LFT's were
trended during the hospitalization.
# HL: He was not compliant with his home lipitor regimen.
During the hospitalization, he was placed on atorvastatin 80mg.
