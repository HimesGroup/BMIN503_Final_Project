Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Codeine / Versed / Colchicine / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 19444**] is a lovely 91-year old woman with a history
of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation off coumadin secondary to
remote GI bleeds who presents with acute onset of left sided
weakness and slurred speech.  Patient was with her nephew
[**Location (un) 1131**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Name (NI) 19450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] card.  At 630 she tried to put her glasses on
with her right hand but kept missing her head.  She then began
drooling out of her left mouth and speech was slurred.  Her
nephew, who is an ophthlamologist and her health care proxy
called 911, and he tried to test her strength.  He asked her to
squeeze his hands, and her left side was clearly weaker.  At one
point after the onset of the weakness he also saw some rhythmic
jerking of her left hand which self-resolved.  By the time she
was brought via EMS to [**Hospital1 18**], she was no longer speaking,
somnolent, and not responding to most questions, though she was
seen to raise her right arm once in response to command.  A CODE
STROKE was called at [**2017**].
.
Of note, ED course was also notable for elevated K at 6.[**Street Address(2) 19451**]
changes for which she was given calcium, insulin, glucose with
improvement to 5.6 but subsequent relative hypoglycemia at 60
for
which she was given [**1-17**] amp D50.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19444**] is a 91-year old woman with a history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation off coumadin secondary to remote
GI bleeds who presents with acute onset of left sided weakness
and slurred speech with some evidence of left hand shaking but
only after onset of deficits.  Initial exam showed marked
somnolence, mutism, left facial droop, decreased movement of
left relative to right with relative preservation in sensory
modality, and visual field cut on left.  Her NIHSS was 28.  Her
head CT showed no acute bleed or well-developed infarct.  Given
the acute onset of left-sided weakness preceding any shaking as
well as the history of atrial fibrillation off of coumadin,
stroke was deemed more likely than seizure, though seizure was
considered as a differential diagnosis.  A 1 mg ativan dose was
given as trial to stop seizure without effect. Further was not
given due to concern of somnolence affecting respiration.  Given
the elevated NIHSS and absence of absolute contraindications,
though multiple relative contraindications were noted,
discussion was had with her nephew/HCP whether to give TPA.
After extensive discussion with regarding the potential risks
and benefits of TPA in this case with particular consideration
to history of GI bleeds, old age, possibility, and possibility
of a seizure contributing to weakness/somnolence, and her desire
not to live if she were to have any additional deficits, the
decision was made to proceed with TPA.  TPA Bolus was given at
831, about 120 minutes after symptom onset.

Within 20 minutes of dose being given clear improvement was
seen.  By 30 minutes post-TPA patient was still somnolent but
arousable to voice or gentle tactile stimulation, eyes closed at
rest.  She could state her name, where she lives, identify her
nephew.  Extraocular movements were full, tongue midline.
Facial weakness was mostly resolved.  She could elevate both
arms to 45 degrees for at least 10 sec though persisted with
grip weakness on the left relative to right.  She could elevated
both lower extremities for 5-7 seconds.  She had withdrawal
responses to noxious stimulation bilaterally.  She denied any
headache.  Plan was made for repeat CT en route to neuro-ICU
with subsequent [**Known lastname **] to neuro-ICU.  An MRI/A did not
demonstrate any acute ischemia, occlusion, or flow limiting
stenosis.

She was initially sent to the ICU for observation then to the
Med floor where she had a stable course. She was discharged to
home given baseline exam. She was given a prednisone taper for
acute gout flare. She was CKD so colchicine was not given. Her
Antiplatlet ASA was not changed after the event. It was
postulated that the event was not vascular in nature but
secondary to a seizure.
