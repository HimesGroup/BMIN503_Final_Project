Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, but this is not required.

### Overview
Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship between dental health and Type 1 diabetes diagnosis in compairison to other factors affecting dental health. To do so, I will be using NHANES data from multiple years to gather enough data. My two advisors are Blanca Himes, PhD, Epidemiology, and Kira Nightingale from the epidemiology department who works in the dental school. Dr Himes has been very helpful in figuring out the question and how to use the NHANES data.

### Introduction 
Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Diet is a vital tool in type 1 diabetes management in order to keep blood glucose levels near normal. Technological advancements in insulin therapies such as insulin pumps and flexible injection regiments have drastically improved the lifestyle of children and adults with diabetes. It is still necessary to calculate carbohydrate intake at each meal to account for the appropriate amount of insulin. A review by Rovner suggests that children with diabetes eat more processed foods because packaged items are appealing to facilitate carbohydrate counting. (1) In instances of hypoglycemia, fast acting carbohydrates are required to quickly raise glucose levels. Often, simple sugars like glucose tablets or skittles and other candy are used because they provide fast acting relief. (2) Overall, these dietary practices may affect dental health. Countless studies have shown the relationship between sugar intake and an increased risk of dental caries. Processed foods also tend to contain more sugar, or additives that can damage oral health. Lastly, the higher glucose levels in blood, is also true in saliva, creating an ideal breeding ground for bacteria in the mouth. (3) There is precedent for the relationship between diabetes and dental health, however, my research has only seen instances of Type 2 diabetes investigated. I am interested in specifically isolated Type 1 cases. 

This issue can be understood through an interdisciplinary approach. The issue must be investigated through a broader public health lens to account for factors such as access to dental care, or smoking status in addition to the clinical factors of dental outcomes. I will use the NHANES data set over multiple years, and practices of statistical models to investigate the data. Fields that can contribute to this understanding are epidemiological, statistical, dental, and endocrine. 

### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

#for some reason I can't figure out OHQ is never added at this point. I looked this up and it's because only 2 data frames allowed for full_join unless you use reduce which then didn't work for other reasons. SO I will add OHQ later but it's nice that everything is loaded together.

#note about the tooth data is that it is only relevent for people >30 so I have to exclude anyone under 30 in my report
#possibly have to just do BCGHIJ for the dentition ones becasue the other ones are weird
```
plans I have to do:
  - compare T1D and T2D by my calculations for the diff teeth stuff
  - see if this is statistically significant
  - look at factors of smoking
  - compare the effects of smoking to people with diabetes for a sense of scale
  - compare access to dental care (I will do this by the question that says haven't been to the dentist but exclude the scared and not recommended people)
  - compare results by gender and race 
  - add in the effect of food security --> does this change anything


things to consider
- what measures are availible for what age groups --> some might not be good for some of the questions
- the way they work with regressions is it will drop observation it will drop them. How will I handle this
- DMFT score, I can create the score from the data (and then treat as continous). I think I will first try with the questionnaire and then see
