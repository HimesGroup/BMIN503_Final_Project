## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load the readr, ggplot2, and dplyr packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

## Loading the dataframes

Loading three dataframes,  the worldwide covid data, GDP per capita of countries and healthcare spending in USD per capita in each country

```{r}

covid_data<-read.csv("WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv",header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
GDP_data<-read.csv("GDP.csv",header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
healthcare_spending<-read.csv("Healthcare spending.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
map<- read.csv("~/Desktop/countrycodes.csv",header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```



```{r}
covid_data<-covid_data%>%
  rename(Date_reported=X...Date_reported)
covid_data$Date_reported <- as.Date(covid_data$Date_reported, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

#Visualising Worldwine Covid Cases

```{r}
#Plotting the number of new cases per day from 3rd Jan 2020 to 15th November 2020
ggplot (data = covid_data, aes(x = Date_reported , y = New_cases)) +
    geom_line(colour='steelblue')+
  labs(title="Worldwide New Cases Per Day",x = "Timeline", y = "New Cases/day")
```
#In the COVID dataframe each country's data has been collected over a period of 318 days from 3rd Jan 2020
```{r}
cov <- covid_data %>% dplyr::group_by(Country) %>% summarise(TotalCases  =  sum(New_cases),
                                                             TotalDeaths = sum(New_deaths),
                                                      Period = n())
cov$fatality <- cov$TotalDeaths/cov$TotalCases
```
#Joining the COVID dataframe with worldwide GDP dataframe
```{r}
cov <- cov %>% inner_join(GDP_data, c("Country" = "country"))
```

#GDP: Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is a metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. Per capita GDP is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations and is used by economists, along with GDP, to analyze the prosperity of a country based on its economic growth. Small, rich countries and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP.

```{r}
#Visualisng the impact of GDP per capita on the Fatality rate due to COVID
ggplot (data = cov, aes(x = gdp_pc , y = fatality)) +
    geom_line(colour='steelblue')+
  labs(title="Impact of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on Fatality",x  = "GDP per capita", y = "Fatality Percent")

```
#Global Peace Index (GPI) is a report produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) which measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness. The GPI ranks 172 independent states and territories (99.7 per cent of the world's population) according to their levels of peacefulness. 

```{r}
#Visualisng the impact of GDP per capita on the Fatality rate due to COVID
ggplot (data = cov, aes(x = gpi_score , y = fatality)) +
    geom_line(colour='steelblue')+
  labs(title="Impact of Global Peace Index (GPI) on Fatality",x  = "GPI", y = "Fatality Percent")

#In this we find that Fatality percent was lower in countries deemed most peaceful. The fatality increased exponentially for countries with GDP greater than 2.6
```
#Visualising the impact of GDP on total number of COVID cases
```{r}
ggplot (data = cov, aes(x = gdp_pc , y = TotalCases)) +
    geom_line(colour='blue')+
  labs(title="Impact of GDP on confirmed cases ",x = "GDP", y = "Total number of Cases")

#Countries with GDP per capita less than 10000 were definitely has a spike in COVID cases. However we see a huge spike in total number of cases with countires with GDP per capita greater than 40000. The United States falls under this category.
```
#Cleaning the healthcare spending dataframe and sorting country out by country code
```{r}
mapping <- covid_data %>% dplyr::group_by(Country, Country_code) %>% summarise(dummy = n())
mapping$dummy <-NULL
cov <- cov %>% inner_join(mapping, "Country")
cov2 <- cov %>% inner_join(healthcare_spending, c("Country_code" = "X...LOCATION"))
colnames(healthcare_spending)
```

```{r}
cov2 <- cov %>% inner_join(map, "Country")
```
#Trying to find out the relation between amount spend on healthcare per capita in each country and the number of cases
```{r}
cov3 <- cov2 %>% inner_join(healthcare_spending, c("Alpha.3.code" = "X...LOCATION"))
colnames(healthcare_spending)[colnames(healthcare_spending)=="X...LOCATION"]<-"Code3"
colnames(cov2)[colnames(cov2)=="Alpha.3.code"]<-"Code3"
healthcare_spending<-read.csv("Healthcare spending.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
healthcare_spending$Code3 <- paste0(" ", healthcare_spending$Code3)
healthcare_spending <-  healthcare_spending %>% filter(TIME == "2019" & SUBJECT == "COMPULSORY")
colnames(healthcare_spending)[colnames(healthcare_spending)=="X...LOCATION"]<-"Code3"
```

```{r}
cov3 <- cov2 %>% inner_join(healthcare_spending, "Code3")
healthcare_spending <- healthcare_spending[,1:8]
View(healthcare_spending$Code3)
```


```{r}
ggplot (data = cov3, aes(x = gdp_pc , y = TotalCases)) +
    geom_line(colour='magenta')+
  labs(x = "Value", y = "TotalCases")
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
