# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Project Overview:
The primary questions driving my research are: How and when did "actionability" become the primary framework to assess when genomic data is useful for patients? How can we conceptualize a more sophisticated, ethical, and effective method for determining when genomic tests are useful in a clinical setting? As a social scientist, my first step in answering these questions is to understand the context surrounding actionability as a concept. To help understand this context, I will perform a natural language processing analysis of all scientific abstracts mentioning "actionability" and related terms that are archived in PubMed and Web of Science. This natural language processing analysis can help answer the following pieces of this research: When did "actionability" first appear in published literature, and how did its use spread over time? What types of fields and journals use the concept of actionability? What words and concepts appear most frequently alongside "actionability?"

Methods: 
This project uses text mining and natural language processing tools to explore published literature related to "actionability," as archived in PubMed and Web of Science. For a full explanation of the methods used in this project, see the Final_Project_Owens.html file.

Results:
See Final_Project_Owens.html for tables and results.
