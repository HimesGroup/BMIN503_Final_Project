# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Project Overview: The goal of my project is to explore the potential relationship between alcohol consumption and economic causes, such as median income and unemployment.

Introduction: Alcohol consumption is the 7th leading risk factor for both death and disability all over the world. It led to 2.8 million deaths in 2016. Although several previous research suggests that moderate level of alcohol consumption brings benefit to humans, this finding has resently been questioned. 
As a matter of fact, a new study published in 2018 (Griswold et al. 2018) states that the level of alcohol consumption which minimize harm on human health is zero. Additionally, negative effect of alcohol on health outcomes raise with the increase in the level of consumption. Therefore, while it is impossible to fully stop populational alcohol use, analyzing potential causes which affect alcohol consumption helps develop preventive strategies.

Methods:  I use the dataset from GHDx named [United States Alcohol Use Prevalence by County 2002-2012](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-alcohol-use-prevalence-county-2002-2012) to get information of the alcohol pattern across the U.S. (by year and sex). Additionally, I use a map shapefile from the US Census Bureau to create map plots, and data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to get the information of median income and unemployment.

Results: I first compared the national value between 2002 and 2012, and I found that the heavy&binge levels of alcohol consumption increase. To figure out how the increase pattern, I made plots for the changes in heavy/binge level of alcohol consumption over the ten years. Up to now, I found that the consumption levels changed dramatically between 2010 and 2012 (increased largely from 2010 to 2011, and then partially dropped back from 2011 to 2012). What I am going to do in the next week is to focus on 2010-2012, build static/interactive maps for those years, and explore potential relationship between alcohol consumption levels and economic factors.
