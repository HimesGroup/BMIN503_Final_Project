# OVERVIEW
My final project will be using the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey to investigate the relationship between mental health outcomes and social predictors in adults living in Philadelphia County. Another layer of this project will examine whether the strength of these relationships differs between geographical areas in the region.

# INTRODUCTION
The problem I am focusing on is how the quality and perception of belonging in oneâ€™s neighborhood can be reflected in the occurrence of a mental disorder diagnosis and whether mental health treatment is sought out. There have been many publications showing increased odds of certain mental disorders in children living in neighborhoods with poor conditions (both physically and socially), but not much research has focused on this relationship in adults (Butler et al., 2012; Dahal et al., 2018; Kemp et al., 2016; Plybon & Kliewer, 2001; Reuben et al., 2020). A similar analysis was conducted in Philadelphia, investigating the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and serious mental illness diagnosis in adults (Byrne et al., 2013). However, my analysis will be using the entire Philadelphia population as a whole, whereas the Bynre et al. analysis only included adults already being treated for serious mental illness.

The dataset to be used is the CHDB Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey from 2018. The 2018 survey was conducted during August 2018-January 2019, sampling 7,501 households in Southeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia County, Bucks County, Chester County, Delaware County, and Montgomery County). I will be focusing on only adult respondents. All of the variables used in this analysis are categorical. The mental health outcome variables are binary (yes/no), while social determinant and demographic variables have varying categorical values.

This project will involve a few fields of knowledge to understand the problems, create appropriate analyses and visuals, and interpret the results and relationships. Firstly, this problem presents as an issue in the field of mental health; we can better understand what factors may predict poorer mental health outcomes. It is also a major issue for public health because the analysis will be at the population level. Revealing what neighborhoods are showing the greatest risks of neighborhood estrangement and associated mental health outcomes will educate public health entities in the Philadelphia area, and could even be a jumping-off point for geographically-targeted mental health interventions. Lastly, data science is an important field that will contribute to this project. The use of data tools to analyze, manipulate, and map these variables will be able to describe and visualize the relationships I aim to explore.

> It appears that most of the social determinant variables are significantly associated with mental health diagnosis on their own, so I will focus on: social capital scale (3 levels), neighbors willing to help each other, feeling of belonging in neighborhood, people in neighborhood can be trusted, and have a park comfortable visiting. Also, there appears to be no relationship between zip code and mental health diagnosis.

> It appears that none of the social variables are significantly associated with seeking mental health treatment. Therefore, I will not move forward with this part of the analysis. There is also no significant relationship between zip code and mental health treatment.

> Given that all of the social determinant variables are highly correlated with each other, they will not be included in the final predictive models. The main independent variable will be the social scale with 3 categories (low, medium, and high) that is calculated based on all social variable responses.

> Significant factors in the logistic regression model when predicting mental health diagnosis: 
> Greater risk: low social capital score, higher attained education, working part-time, being unemployed, being unable to work/disabled, being below the poverty line
> Lower risk: being male, age over 50, being gay/lesbian, being heterosexual

> The out-of-bag estimate of error rate for random forest model is 18.28%, and the error is quite high for mental health diagosis=1 (89.5%). The most significant factor contributing to the model was employment status, followed by educational level, and then by age.

> The logistic regression model shows acceptable performance for predicting mental health diagnosis based on the social capital scale, adjusting for several demographic variables, with an AUC of 0.7145. 

> The random forest model shows poor performance for the same prediction after cross-validation, with an AUC of 0.5008. This could be explained by the imbalance in the mental health diagnosis outcome (only 18.3% have a diagnosis).


# CONCLUSIONS

> Mental health diagnosis was significantly associated with all social factors captured in the CHDB survey, particularly between low and high social capital scale (e.g. those with low social capital scale scores were predicted to be ~1.5x more likely to have a mental health diagnosis). This relationship stands even when controlling for various demographic variables such as sex, age, and race (amongst many others).

> Mental health treatment was not significantly associated with any social determinant variables.

> Geographic location of residence based on zip code did not have an effect on mental health diagnosis or treatment, but a difference was seen for high social capital areas (e.g. certain neighborhoods had much higher rates of high social scale responses than other neighborhoods).

> A logistic regression model showed the best performance in predicting mental health diagnosis based on social capital scale score, controlling for demographic variables.

> The main takeaway from this project is that the level of social comfort and coherence felt in one's neighborhood is a significant predictor of ever receiving a mental health diagnosis, even when controlling for several demographic variables. There were not any notable geographical differences in mental health diagnosis rates between residential zip codes, so there would be no urgent need to target any specific neighborhoods for mental health interventions.
