Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-25**] Left Craniotomy for mass resection


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1852**] is a 62-year-old left-handed man who is here for a
follow up of his left sphenoid meningioma.  I last saw him on
[**2149-11-17**] and his head CT showed growth of the left sphenoid
meningioma.  He is seizure free.  Today, he is here with his
wife
and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] does not have headache, nausea, vomiting,
urinary incontinence, or fall.

His neurological problem began on [**2142-6-22**] when he became
confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.  At that time, he
was visiting his daughter for a wedding.  His wife found him
slumped over in the bath tube.  According to her, his eyes
looked
funny.  He could not stand up.  His verbal output did not make
sense.  He was brought to [**Doctor First Name 1853**] Hospital in Placentia,
CA.  He woke up 7 to 8 hours later in the emergency room.  He
felt very tired after the event.  He was hospitalized from
[**2142-6-22**] to [**2142-6-25**].  He had a cardiac pacemaker placement due
to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.  He also had a head MRI
that showed a less than 1 cm diameter sphenoid meningioma.


Past Medical History:
Cardiac arrhythmia as noted above, has a
pacemaker in place, prostate cancer with prostatectomy, and
hypertension.


Social History:
Lives with his wife.  Retired, works parttime
driving a school bus.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Temperature is 97.8 F.  His blood pressure
is 150/92.  Pulse is 80.  Respiration is 16.  His skin
has full turgor.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.  His lungs
are clear.  His abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.  His
extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurological Examination:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  There His
language is fluent with good comprehension.  His recent recall
is
intact.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  His pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular
movements are full.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  Funduscopic examination reveals sharp
disks margins bilaterally.  His face is symmetric.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.  His muscle
strengths are [**5-16**] at all muscle groups.  His muscle tone is
normal.  His reflexes are 0 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  His ankle jerks are absent.  His toes are
down going.  Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  His gait is normal.  He can do tandem.  He does not
have a Romberg.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
non focal
incision c/d/i, dissolvable sutures

Pertinent Results:
[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid
bone,
measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent
study of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.
2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly
over the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].

[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
Expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy
including
subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate
pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal
lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. No evidence
of residual tumor on this non contrast CT.

[**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low. There is
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. Right pectoral pacemaker
in situ, with correct lead placement.


[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal
craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable
3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage
with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in
appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic
edema. Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Followup to
assess for residual tumor/ interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy
for mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively still intubated.
Shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was
done without difficulty. At post-op check he was neurologically
intact.
On [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to
the stepdown unit. This did not happen due to bed shortage. A CT
with contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.
On [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the
floor. Decadron taper was initiated. He was seen by PT and
cleared for discharge home.
On [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was
noted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. His
other vitals were stable. Electrophysiology was consulted and
they recommended increasing the metoprolol XL dose to 100mg
Qday. The patient was kept overnight to monitor this new dose.
On [**3-1**] her remained stable neurologically and hemodynamically
therefore he was cleared for discharge.
