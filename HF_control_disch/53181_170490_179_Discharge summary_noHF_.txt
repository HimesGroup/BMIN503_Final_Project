History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 622**] [**Known lastname 1836**] is a 62-year-old woman, with longstanding
history of rheumatoid arthritis, probable Sweet's syndrome, and
multiple joint complications requiring orthopedic interventions.
She was found to hve a right cavernous sinus and nasopharyngeal
mass.  She underwent a biopsy of hte nasopharyngeal mass by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] and the pathology, including flow
cytometry,
was reactive for T-cell lymphoid hyperplasia only.

She has a longstanding history of rheumatoid arthritis that
involved small and large joints in her body.  Her disease is
currently controlled by abatacept, hydroxychloroquine, and
methotrexate.  She also has a remote history of erythematous
nodules at her shins, dermatosis (probable Sweet's disease),
severe holocranial headache with an intensity of [**9-28**], and
dysphagia.  But her symptoms resolved with treatment for
autoimmune disease.  Please refer additional past medical
history, past surgical history, facial history, and social
history to the initial note on [**2171-11-4**].

She cam to the BTC for discussion about management of her right
cavernous sinus mass that extends into the middle cranial fossa.


She had a recent head CT at the [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's Hospital on
[**2171-11-29**], when she went for a consultation there.
She is neurologically stable without headache, nausea, vomiting,
seizure, imbalance, or fall. She has no new systemic complaints.

Her neurological problem started [**9-/2171**] when she experienced
frontal pressure-like sensations.  There was no temporal
pattern;
but they may occur more often in the evening.
She had fullness in her ear and she also had a cold coinciding
to
the onset of her headache.  By late [**Month (only) 359**] and early [**2171-10-21**], she also developed a sharp pain intermittently in the
right
temple region.
She did not have nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, imbalance, or
fall.  A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, performed at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2171-10-30**], showed a bright mass
involving the cavernous sinus.

Past Medical History:
She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis unspecified
dermatosis, right knee replacement, left hip replacement, and
fusion of subtalar joint, and resection of a benign left parotid
gland tumor.


Social History:
She is married.  She had smoked for approximately a year and a
half when she was younger, but is not currently smoking.  She
has approximately one glass of wine per week.  She is retired
but was employed as a teacher.


Family History:
Cancer, diabetes, hearing loss, and heart disease.


Physical Exam:
AF VSS
HEENT normal
no LNN
Neck supple.
RRR
CTA
NTTP
warm peripherals

Neurological Examination:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  She is neurologically intact.


Pertinent Results:
MRI [**3-5**]
Right middle cranial fossa mass likely represents a meningioma
and is stable since MRI of [**2172-2-11**]. The previously seen
midline nasopharyngeal mass has decreased in size since MRI of
[**2168-2-11**]. Direct visual inspection would be helpful for
further assessment of the nasopharyngeal mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for meningioma resection of [**3-5**].
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the
operating room. She was trasnported to the ICU post-operatively
for management. She had no complications and was transferred to
the floor and observed for 24 hours. Prelim path is consistent
with meningioma.
She has dissolvable sutures, and will need to come to
neurosurgery clinic in [**6-28**] days for wound check only.
She will need to be scheduled for brain tumor clinic. She will
complete Decadron taper on [**3-10**] and then restart her maintenance
dose of prednisone. She will also be taking Keppra for seizure
prophlyaxis.
Her neurologic examination was intact with no deficits at
discharge. She was tolerating regular diet. She should continue
to take over the counter laxatives as needed.
