.
[**2112-12-8**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No definite
pleural effusions are seen. There is diffusely increased
interstitial opacity disease, predominantly in the lower lung
zones. No pneumothorax seen. The osseous structures are stable.
A hiatal hernia is noted. Tiny left pleural effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION: Diffusely increased interstitial opacities. This
appearance is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion
superimposed upon chronic interstitial changes.
.
[**2112-12-9**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-19**] and
[**12-8**]:

Severe progressive interstitial abnormality accompanied by
pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion is most likely
edema, but severe interstitial pneumonia either infectious or
drug related could simulate these findings. Chronic hiatus
hernia unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with CAD, CHF, HTN, recent PE ([**10-17**]), who presents from
rehab with PNA and hypoxia.
.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. Patient was started
on Zosyn and vancomycin for pneumonia. Her fluid status was
closely monitored given her underlying CHF. On admission her
daughters were in disagreement over her code status and her
original long standing DNR/DNI status was changed to allow for
intubation if needed. However, when the patient's respiratory
status continued to decline to the point of need for intubation,
the patient refused intubation. Her family was notified and
agreed that their mother's wishes should be fulfilled.  She was
started on IV morphine then converted to morphine drip on HD #3
for comfort and all other medications were discontinued. Her
family was at her bedside and their Rabbi was called. She died
on [**2112-12-10**] at 2:20 pm. An autopsy was offered, but the family
declined.
