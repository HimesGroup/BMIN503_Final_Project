Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
81 yo F smoker w/ COPD, severe TBM, s/p tracheobronchoplasty [**5-5**]
s/p perc trach [**5-13**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy 3/31,4/2,3,[**6-12**], [**5-17**], [**5-19**]
s/p trachealplasty [**5-5**]
percutaneous tracheostomy [**5-13**] after failed extubation
down size trach on [**5-25**] to size 6 cuffless


History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
[**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

[**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
[**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c [**2119-4-19**] in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up \"dark
sputum\".
