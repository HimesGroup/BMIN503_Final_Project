## **Overview**
    \
    This project aimed to spatially describe and statistically compare social determinants of health, COVID epidemiology, and election results to answer the question: Is there an association between county-level social determinants of health (ex. poverty rates, income), COVID-19 disease epidemiology (case and death rates), and recent election results (outcome for 2020 elections).\
    \
    I spoke with the following faculty:\
    * Julia Lynch, PhD | Professor, Political Science, School of Arts and Sciences\
    * John H. Holmes | Professor, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine\
    \
    Dr. Holmes advised that my question initially may have had a very obvious answer (conservative voting history may be associated with greater COVID cases and deaths). Dr. Lynch advised me to narrow my question and define it much more clearly, such as which sociodemographic factors I would use. Dr. Lynch also suggested that voter turnout might be an interesting metric that has not yet been looked at in this context. Furthermore, in order to go beyond a purely descriptive project, I could also assess if the socioeconomic status gradient in voting correlates with SES gradient in COVID epidemiology.\

## **Introduction**
    \
    COVID-19 is an urgent and deadly public health crisis that has infected over 15.6 million Americans and claimed over 296,000 lives. Emerging evidence suggests that political partisanship has influenced individuals’ voluntary decisions to engage prevention practices such as distancing and mask-wearing (Grossman G, et.al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Sep 2020, 117 (39) 24144-24153; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2007835117). Social determinants of health such as poverty and homelessness also have been linked to increased COVID-19 transmission (Abrams E, Szefler S. COVID-19 and the impact of social determinants of health. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 2020;8(7):659-661. doi:10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30234-4). Additionally, the COVID-19-associated death rates for Black and Latino people are 2-3 times higher than for white people, with these estimates rising further when adjusted for age.(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) People of color, especially Black Americans, also have an elevated occupational risk of exposure to COVID-19 since they are more likely to be employed as “essential” workers, putting them in higher risk settings. These disparities span across all age groups and across rural to urban counties in numerous states. Underlying health conditions do not solely account for this, as inequities stemming from systemic racism can contribute to disease exposure, morbidity, and mortality at both the individual and neighborhood level. Existing data shows that areas with higher poverty rates, population density, and proportion of minority populations are associated with increased odds for infection. However, the 2020 Presidential election results compared alongside social determinants of health has not yet been evaluated in the context of COVID-19 epidemiology. Given the great partisan divide currently plaguing American politics and the catastrophic toll COVID-19 has had on Americans, such analyses are timely and important in understanding what populations are vulnerable to infection. Therefore, the objective of this analyses is to spatially describe and statistically compare social determinants of health. voting, and COVID-19 epidemiology.
    \
    \
    The problem described above is interdisciplinary because it looks at COVID-19 health outcomes in both a socioeconomic and political context. It is generally accepted that lower socioeconomic status is associated with lower civic engagement, and data has shown that higher levels of income inequality is associated with lower voter turnout (Galbraith, J., & Hale, J. (2008). State Income Inequality and Presidential Election Turnout and Outcomes. Social Science Quarterly, 89(4), 887-901. http://www.jstor.org/stable/42956351). Since COVID-19 transmission is both linked to socioeconomic status and influenced by personal behavior, interdisciplinary analyses using recent election results might help health officials better understand vulnerable populations in their communities. The partisan spin irrationally applied to mask-wearing practices and the lack of federal leadership has only amplified the partisan divide and amplified COVID-19 infections.
\
## **Methods**
\
### Data Sources
\
Publicly available data was used for all measures in this project. The county level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) data, an index created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to evaluate a community’ ability to manage disaster response, was used for all socioeconomic status measures. The SVI uses data from 15 U.S. census variables on social factors in its creation. Although the SVI was designed for environmental disasters, it incorporates information about poverty, access to transportation, and population density, all which are relevant to infectious disease transmission. These SVI data are from 2018, the most recent publicly available SVI data set on the CDC website. Geographic county shapefiles were also obtained from the SVI data.
\
Pennsylvania county-level COVID-19 case and death data was extracted from OpenData Pennsylvania, a portal to which the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) uploads its COVID-19 data. The data includes all reported COVID-19 cases and deaths until December 1,2020. Presidential election data for 2020, which included Donald Trump and Joseph Biden raw votes counts by county, was downloaded from Politico which was sourced from the Associated Press. These data were also as recent as December 1, 2020. I chose to limit my analyses to Pennsylvania since it was a critical swing state in the 2020 Presidential election and has clearly segregated voting outcomes by county.
\
### Analysis
Next, bivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to determine associations between the dichotomized 2020 presidential election outcome (Trump vs. Biden) and all socioeconomic and COVID-19 (cases, deaths) predictors. Bivariate analyses using linear regression were also performed to determine associations between case and death rates and all socioeconomic and election outcome predictors. Case and death rates were chosen for this instead of cumulative/total counts to account for difference in population size between counties. Using a threshold of p = 0.15, variables were selected for inclusion in the final models. The threshold was selected as p = 0.15, a slightly more stringent than the commonly used p = 0.20 in the literature, to create a parsimonius model. Finally, multivariable logistic and linear regressions were used to look at associations between the 2020 presidential election outcome (Trump vs. Biden), COVID-19 case and death rates, all corresponding significant predictor variables to assess relationships. For the regression models, alpha = 0.05 was used to determine significance.

## **Results**
\
I mapped social determinants of health, COVID epidemiology, and election results and then created regression models to assess associations.

### Mapping Socioeconomic Factors, COVID-19 Epidemiology, and 2020 Presidential Election Results

I spatially mapped numerous socioeconomic factors from the Social Vulnerability Index, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and election results by county in one of the critical swing states in the 2020 Presidential election, Pennsylvania.

####Logistic Regression Models
```{r}
#Printing results
multi.results %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic_2(full_width = F) %>% add_header_above(c(" ", "Table 4. Full Multivariable Logistic Regression Model Results" = 4))
```
The overall full multivariable logistic regression yielded no significant association between predictors and the outcome of the election (Biden), with wide confidence intervals all crossing 1 and most odds ratios close to 1 (Table 4, above).
```{r}
socio.results %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic_2(full_width = F) %>% add_header_above(c(" ", "Table 5. Multivariable Logistic Model (Outcome: Election | Predictors: Socioeconomic) Results" = 4))
```
I created a slightly more parsimonious model by removing COVID-19-related variables. The multivariable logistic regression assessing if any socioeconomic predictors were associated with election outcome yielded no significant association between predictors and the outcome of the election (Biden), with wide confidence intervals all crossing 1 and most odds ratios close to 1 (Table 5, above).

```{r}
lm.cases.results %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic_2(full_width = F) %>% add_header_above(c(" ", "Table 6. Linear Regression Model (Outcome: Cumulative Case Rate | Predictors: Socioecnomic and Election) Results" = 2))
```
```{r}
lm.deaths.results %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic_2(full_width = F) %>% add_header_above(c(" ", "Table 7. Linear Regression Model (Outcome: Total Death Rate | Predictors: Socioecnomic and Election) Results" = 2))
```

Based on multivariable linear regression models (Table 6 and 7, above), the percent of population uninsured seems to be the only significant predictor of both cumulative case rates (p = 0.005) and total death rates (p = 0.003). While both linear models are significant overall (p = 0.021 and p = 0.013, respectively), the models fits are poor, as is evidences by R-squared values below 0.5, and none of the other selected socioeconomic factors are significant predictors in the model.


## **Conclusions**

Philadelphia county seems to be one of the msot diverse counties in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia county also also has the highest amount and proportion of people unemployed and living in poverty. Many rural counties in PA have high poverty, unemployment, percent uninsured, and COVID case rates. Rural counties generally voted for Trump, while urban and suburban counties generally voted for Biden.

While many socioeconomic factors were significantly associated with election results, COVID-19 case rates, and COVID-19 death rates individually, when added to a multivariable model, only percent uninsured remaining a significant predictor for COVID-19 epidemiology at the county level.

It would be interesting to further refine variable selection and perform such analyses at a more granular geographic unit of analyses. One limitation of this study is the small sample size in the total number of counties (n = 67) in Pennsylvania, especially with a majority of those going to Trump. To increase sample size and power this study further, it would be interesting to replicate and expand these analyses to include other swing states (ex. Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin) and the whole country.
