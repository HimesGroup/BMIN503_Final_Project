# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
 
This project is an analysis of data from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) containing alcohol use prevalence from 2002 to 2012. The dataset provides alcohol use prevalence estimates by year and sex for nation (United States), states, and counties. It also divides alcohol consumption degree into three levels: any drinking; heavy drinking; and binge drinking. It also include helper files such as shapefiles (from ACS), states code, and state center coordinates for the purpose of making maps.

This project uses statistical analysis, geographical analysis, and graphical analysis to represent trends for each state over time and differences between sex.

The goal of this project is to explore the potential relationship between alcohol use prevalence vs. geography and median household income.
