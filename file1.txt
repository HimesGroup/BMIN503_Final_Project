AB An accurate profiling of the genomic landscape is mandatory to establish the best clinical and therapeutic approach for patients with solid malignancies. Moreover, tumor cells constantly adapt to external pressures-i.e., systemic treatment-with the selection and expansion of resistant subclones and the emergence of heterogeneous overlapping genomic alterations of resistance. The current standard for molecular characterization in cancer is the performance of a tissue tumor biopsy at the time of diagnosis and, when possible, a re-biopsy at the time of progression. However, tissue biopsy is not always feasible or practical and may underestimate tumor heterogeneity and clonal dynamics. Circulating DNA fragments carrying tumor-specific sequence alterations (circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA) are released from cancer cells into the bloodstream, representing a variable and generally small fraction of the total circulating cell-free DNA. Tumor genotyping in ctDNA (liquid biopsy) offers potential advantages versus the standard tumor tissue biopsy, including non-invasiveness and representation of molecular heterogeneity. Technical advances in sequencing platforms have led to dramatic improvements in variant detection sensitivity and specificity that allow for the detection and quantification of low levels of ctDNA. This provides valuable information on both actionable mutations and captures real-time variations in tumor dynamics. Liquid biopsy clinical applications include molecular diagnosis, determination of tumor load as a surrogate marker of early response, monitoring of mutations of resistance to targeted therapy and detection of minimal residual disease after cancer surgery. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the biological rational and technical background of ctDNA analysis, as well as on the main clinical applications of liquid biopsy in dynamic treatment stratification in solid tumors. Special emphasis will be made on the current and potential benefits of the implementation of ctDNA in clinical practice, mainly in melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer.

AB This volume is intended to review the methods used to identify biomarkers predictive of cancer responsiveness to immunotherapy. The successful development of clinically actionable biomarkers depends upon three features: (a) their biological role with respect to malignant transformation and tumor progression; (b) the ability to detect them with robust, reliable, and clinically applicable assays; and (c) their prognostic or predictive value, as validated in clinical trials.Identifying biomarkers that have predictive value for patient selection based on the likelihood of benefiting from anticancer immunotherapy is a lengthy and complex process. To date, few predictive biomarkers for anticancer immunotherapy have been robustly analytically and clinically validated (i.e., PD-L1 expression as measured by IHC assays and microsatellite instability (MSI)/dMMR as measured by PCR or IHC, respectively).This introductory chapter to this book focuses on scientific and technical aspects relevant to the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy. We emphasize that methods should address both the biology of the tumor and the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the identification of biomarkers requires highly sensitive, multiplexed, comprehensive techniques, especially for application in clinical care. Thus, in this chapter, we will define the outstanding questions related to the immune biology of cancer as a base for development of the biomarkers and assays using diverse methodologies. These biomarkers will likely be identified through research that integrates conventional immunological approaches along with high-throughput genomic and proteomic screening and the host immune response of individual patients that relates to individual tumor biology and immune drugs' mechanism of action.Checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CIT) is by now an accepted modality of cancer treatment. However, immune resistance is common, and most patients do not benefit from the treatment. The reasons for resistance are diverse, and approaches to circumvent it need to consider genetic, biologic, and environmental factors that affect anticancer immune response. Here, we propose to systematically address fundamental concepts based on the premise that malignant cells orchestrate their surroundings by interacting with innate and adaptive immune sensors. This principle applies to most cancers and governs their evolution in the immune-competent host. Understanding the basic requirement(s) for this evolutionary process will guide biomarker discovery and validation and ultimately guide to effective therapeutic choices. This volume will also discuss novel biomarker approaches aimed at informing an effective assay development from a mechanistic point of view, as well as the clinical implementation (i.e., patient enrichment) for immune therapies.

AB Mathematical modeling in biology has a long history as it allows the analysis and simulation of complex dynamic biological systems at little cost. A mathematical model trained on experimental or clinical data can be used to generate and evaluate hypotheses, to ask "what if" questions, and to perform in silico experiments to guide future experimentation and validation. Such models may help identify and provide insights into the mechanisms that drive changes in dynamic systems. While a mathematical model may never replace actual experiments, it can synergize with experiments to save time and resources by identifying experimental conditions that are unlikely to yield favorable outcomes, and by using optimization principles to identify experiments that are most likely to be successful. Over the past decade, numerous models have also been developed for oncolytic virotherapy, ranging from merely theoretic frameworks to fully integrated studies that utilize experimental data to generate actionable hypotheses. Here we describe how to develop such models for specific oncolytic virotherapy experimental setups, and which questions can and cannot be answered using integrated mathematical oncology.

AB Primary care clinicians care for an extremely diverse range of patients, and they therefore have numerous opportunities to measure and act to improve the health of various populations. In order to take effective actions to improve the health of their patient populations, primary care clinicians must measure health. Strong population health metrics are characterized by their high validity, consistency, feasibility, and interpretability. Population health metrics should be applied longitudinally to obtain the most information from available data. Optimal population health metrics are actionable and facilitate the implementation of effective strategies to improve population health through administrative or clinical programs.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are rare, certain tumor types each represent less than 2% of the total and an annual incidence of about 1000 patients or less. Most of them are disproportionally diagnosed in children and young adults, but older adults can also be affected and are rarely recruited to clinical trials. Recent new molecular techniques have led to reclassification of some of these tumors and discovery of actionable molecular alterations.; RECENT FINDINGS: We review recent progress in the molecular understanding and therapeutic options of selected rare CNS tumors, with a focus on select clinical trials (temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent ependymoma; vemurafenib for BRAFV600E-mutated tumors), as well as tumor-agnostic approvals (pembrolizumab, larotrectinib) and their implications for rare CNS tumors.; SUMMARY: Although rare CNS tumors are a very small fraction of the total of cancers, they represent a formidable challenge. There is a need for dedicated clinical trials with strong correlative component in patients of all ages with rare CNS tumors. Critical research questions include relevance of the selected target for specific tumor types, persistence of the actionable biomarker at recurrence, blood-brain barrier penetration, and analysis of mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance.

AB INTRODUCTION: Depressive disorder is one of the major public health problems among the elderly. An effective depression risk prediction model can provide insights on the disease progression and potentially inform timely targeted interventions. Therefore, research on predicting the onset of depressive disorder for elderly adults considering the sequential progression patterns is critically needed.; OBJECTIVE: This research aims to develop a state-of-the-art deep learning model for the individualized prediction of depressive disorder with a 22-year longitudinal survey data among elderly people in the United States.; METHODS: We obtain the 22-year longitudinal survey data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, which consists of information on 20,000 elderly people in the United States from 1992 to 2014. To capture temporal and high-order interactions among risk factors, the proposed deep learning model utilizes a recurrent neural network framework with a multitask structure. The C-statistic and the mean absolute error are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model and a set of baseline models.; RESULTS: The experiments with the 22-year longitudinal survey data indicate that (a) machine learning models can provide an accurate prediction of the onset of depressive disorder for elderly individuals; (b) the temporal patterns of risk factors are associated with the onset of depressive disorder; and (c) the proposed multitask deep learning model exhibits superior performance as compared with baseline models.; CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the capability of deep learning-based prediction models in capturing temporal and high-order interactions among risk factors, which are usually ignored by traditional regression models. This research sheds light on the use of machine learning models to predict the onset of depressive disorder among elderly people. Practically, the proposed methods can be implemented as a decision support system to help clinicians make decisions and inform actionable intervention strategies for elderly people.

AB People with multiple chronic conditions often struggle with managing their health. The purpose of this research was to identify specific challenges of patients with multiple chronic conditions and to use the findings to form design principles for a telemonitoring system tailored for these patients. Semi-structured interviews with 15 patients with multiple chronic conditions and 10 clinicians were conducted to gain an understanding of their needs and preferences for a smartphone-based telemonitoring system. The interviews were analyzed using a conventional content analysis technique, resulting in six themes. Design principles developed from the themes included that the system must be modular to accommodate various combinations of conditions, reinforce a routine, consolidate record keeping, as well as provide actionable feedback to the patients. Designing an application for multiple chronic conditions is complex due to variability in patient conditions, and therefore, design principles developed in this study can help with future innovations aimed to help manage this population.

AB Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. MET tyrosine kinase receptor [MET, c-MET, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor] pathway activation is associated with the appearance of several hallmarks of cancer. The HGF/MET pathway has emerged as an important actionable target across many solid tumors; therefore, biomarker discovery becomes essential in order to guide clinical intervention and patient stratification with the aim of moving towards personalized medicine. The focus of this review is on how the aberrant activation of the HGF/MET pathway in tumor tissue or the circulation can provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and predictive biomarkers of drug response. Many meta-analyses have shown that aberrant activation of the MET pathway in tumor tissue, including MET gene overexpression, gene amplification, exon 14 skipping and other activating mutations, is almost invariably associated with shorter survival and poor prognosis. Most meta-analyses have been performed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast, head and neck cancers as well as colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and other gastrointestinal cancers. Furthermore, several studies have shown the predictive value of MET biomarkers in the identification of patients who gain the most benefit from HGF/MET targeted therapies administered as single or combination therapies. The highest predictive values have been observed for response to foretinib and savolitinib in renal cancer, as well as tivantinib in NSCLC and colorectal cancer. However, some studies, especially those based on MET expression, have failed to show much value in these stratifications. This may be rooted in lack of standardization of methodologies, in particular in scoring systems applied in immunohistochemistry determinations or absence of oncogenic addiction of cancer cells to the MET pathway, despite detection of overexpression. Measurements of amplification and mutation aberrations are less likely to suffer from these pitfalls. Increased levels of MET soluble ectodomain (sMET) in circulation have also been associated with poor prognosis; however, the evidence is not as strong as it is with tissue-based biomarkers. As a diagnostic biomarker, sMET has shown its value in distinguishing cancer patients from healthy individuals in prostate and bladder cancers and in melanoma. On the other hand, increased circulating HGF has also been presented as a valuable prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in many cancers; however, there is controversy on the predictive value of HGF as a biomarker. Other biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor HGF levels have also been briefly covered. In conclusion, HGF/MET aberrations can provide valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers and represent vital assets for personalized cancer therapy.

AB Despite availability of a safe, effective vaccination, uptake and completion rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination remain low in the United States. This is particularly true in the southeast, which also sees some of the highest rates of HPV-associated (HPVa) cancers. We aimed to identify areas in Alabama in need of intervention with respect to HPVa cancers and HPV vaccination, and factors potentially associated with these rates by performing county-level secondary data analysis using state and national data sources. Alabama ranks 15th nationally in HPVa cancer rates, with 66.7% and 80.8% of counties having higher HPVa cancer rates than the national incidences of males and females, respectively. Regarding HPV vaccination, 95.5% and 98.5% of Alabama's counties have uptake rates less than the national averages for males and females, respectively. The seven counties with the highest HPV vaccination uptake ranged in rates from 60.2 to 73.6%. Counties with the highest HPV vaccination rates for adolescents were majority African American with low adult educational attainment rates and high rates of poverty and publicly-insured children/adolescents. These counties were also located in Alabama's Black Belt region, traditionally known for low socioeconomics, reduced access to social services, and negative health outcomes. Some counties with the highest rates of HPVa cancers also had among the highest rates of HPV vaccination, indicating a potential association between perceived susceptibility and desire to get HPV vaccine in these communities, warranting further investigation. Future work is needed to translate these findings into actionable intervention practices to increase HPV vaccination.

AB OBJECTIVES: We recently described metabolic nodal stage (mN) and response (mNR) of cancer of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using 18F-FDG PET-CT as new markers of disease progression, recurrence, and death. We aimed to validate our findings.; METHODS: Our validation cohort comprised all patients consecutive to our discovery cohort, staged before and after NAC using PET-CT from 2014 to 2017. Multivariate binary logistic and Cox regression were performed.; RESULTS: Fifty-one of the 200 patients had FDG-avid nodes after NAC (25.5%; i.e., lack of complete mNR), and were more likely to progress during NAC to incurable disease on PET-CT or at surgery: odds ratio 3.84 (1.46-10.1; p=0.006). In 176 patients undergoing successful resection, patients without complete mNR had a worse prognosis: disease-free survival hazard ratio 2.46 (1.34-4.50); p=0.004. These associations were independent of primary tumor metabolic, pathological response, and stage. In a hybrid pathological/metabolic nodal stage, avid nodal metastases conferred a worse prognosis than non-avid metastases. Lack of complete mNR predicted recurrence or death at 1 and 2years: positive predictive values 44.4% (31.7-57.8) and 74.1% (56.6-86.3) respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides temporal validation for mNR as a new and independent predictive and prognostic marker of esophageal and GEJ cancer treated with NAC and surgery, although external validation is required to assess generalizability. mNR may provide surrogate information regarding the phenotype of metastatic cancer clones beyond the mere presence of nodal metastases, and might be used to better inform patients, risk stratify, and personalize management, including adjuvant therapy.; KEY POINTS:  We previously described metabolic nodal response (mNR) of esophageal cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using 18 F-FDG PET-CT as a predictor of unresectable disease, early recurrence, and death.  We report the first validation of these findings. In an immediately consecutive cohort, we found consistent proportions of patients with and without mNR, and associations with abandoned resection, early recurrence, and death.  This supports mNR as a new and actionable biomarker in esophageal cancer. Although external validation is required, mNR may provide surrogate information about the chemosensitivity of metastatic subclones, and the means to predict treatment success, guide personalized therapy, and follow-up.

AB PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the impact of advanced care planning (ACP) on potentially avoidable hospital admissions at the end of life (EOL) among a sample of hospice-referred patients with cancer, in order to present actionable considerations for the practicing clinician.; METHODS: This study was designed as a retrospective cohort using electronic health record data that assessed likelihood of hospital admissions in the last 30 days of life for 1185 patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer, referred to hospice between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, at a large academic medical center. Inverse probability treatment weighting based on calculated propensity scores balanced measured covariates between those with and without ACP at baseline. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from estimated potential outcome means for the impact of ACP on admissions in the last 30 days of life.; RESULTS: A verified do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order prior to the last 30 days of life was associated with reduced odds of admission compared to those without a DNR (OR = 0.30; P < .001). An ACP note in the problem list prior to the last 30 days of life was associated with reduced odds of admission compared to those without an ACP note (OR = 0.71, P = .042), and further reduced odds if done 6 months prior to death (OR = 0.35, P < .001).; CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that dedicated ACP documentation is associated with fewer admissions in the last 30 days of life for patients with advanced cancer referred to hospice. Improving ACP processes prior to hospice referral holds promise for reducing EOL admissions.

AB Multigene panels provide a powerful tool for analyzing several genes simultaneously. We evaluated the frequency of pathogenic variants (PV) in customized predefined panels according to clinical suspicion by phenotype and compared it to the yield obtained in the analysis of our clinical research gene panel. We also investigated mutational yield of opportunistic testing of BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair (MMR) genes in all patients. A total of 1,205 unrelated probands with clinical suspicion of hereditary cancer were screened for germline mutations using panel testing. Overall, 1,048 females and 157 males were analyzed, mean age at cancer diagnosis was 48; 883 had hereditary breast/ovarian cancer-suspicion, 205 hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)-suspicion, 73 adenomatous-polyposis-suspicion and 44 with other/multiple clinical criteria. At least one PV was found in 150 probands (12%) analyzed by our customized phenotype-driven panel. Tumoral MMR deficiency predicted for the presence of germline MMR gene mutations in patients with HNPCC-suspicion (46/136 vs. 0/56 in patients with and without MMR deficiency, respectively). Opportunistic testing additionally identified five MSH6, one BRCA1 and one BRCA2 carriers (0.6%). The analysis of the extended 24-gene panel provided 25 additional PVs (2%), including in 4 out of 51 individuals harboring MMR-proficient colorectal tumors (2 CHEK2 and 2 ATM). Phenotype-based panels provide a notable rate of PVs with clinical actionability. Opportunistic testing of MMR and BRCA genes leads to a significant straightforward identification of MSH6, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and endorses the model of opportunistic testing of genes with clinical utility within a standard genetic counseling framework. © 2019 UICC.

AB BACKGROUND: A small proportion of the population consumes the majority of health care resources. High-cost health care users are a heterogeneous group. We aim to segment a provincial population into relevant homogenous sub-groups to provide actionable information on risk factors associated with high-cost health care use within sub-populations.; METHODS: The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Population Grouping methodology was used to define mutually exclusive and clinically relevant health profile sub-groups. High-cost users (>=90th percentile of health care spending) were defined within each sub-group. Univariate analyses explored demographic, socio-economic status, health status and health care utilization variables associated with high-cost use. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed for the costliest health profile groups.; RESULTS: From 2015 to 2017, 1,175,147 individuals were identified for study. High-cost users consumed 41% of total health care resources. Average annual health care spending for individuals not high-cost were $642; high-cost users were $16,316. The costliest health profile groups were 'long-term care', 'palliative', 'major acute', 'major chronic', 'major cancer', 'major newborn', 'major mental health' and 'moderate chronic'. Both 'major acute' and 'major cancer' health profile groups were largely explained by measures of health care utilization and multi-morbidity. In the remaining costliest health profile groups modelled, 'major chronic', 'moderate chronic', 'major newborn' and 'other mental health', a measure of socio-economic status, low neighbourhood income, was statistically significantly associated with high-cost use.; INTERPRETATION: Model results point to specific, actionable information within clinically meaningful subgroups to reduce high-cost health care use. Health equity, specifically low socio-economic status, was statistically significantly associated with high-cost use in the majority of health profile sub-groups. Population segmentation methods, and more specifically, the CIHI Population Grouping Methodology, provide specificity to high-cost health care use; informing interventions aimed at reducing health care costs and improving population health.

AB Improvements in the outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have lagged behind advances made in the treatment of many other malignancies over the past few decades. For most patients with PDAC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with resectable disease, modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) is the standard-of-care adjuvant therapy, although data from several randomized trials have shown improved outcomes with neoadjuvant treatment strategies. For patients with advanced-stage or metastatic disease, comprehensive genomic profiling has revealed several potentially actionable alterations in small subsets of patients and the feasibility of implementing such strategies is beginning to be confirmed. Novel therapies targeting certain aberrations, most notably BRCA1/2 mutations, mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies or NTRK1-3 fusions, have shown considerable activity in clinical trials, and larotrectinib, entrectinib and pembrolizumab have received FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tumours harbouring NTRK fusions and MMR deficiencies, respectively, regardless of primary tumour histology. In this Review, we describe the available data on the activity of these and other agents in patients with PDAC. Our discussion is structured according to the acronym 'PRIME' to organize the various treatment strategies currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials: Pathway inhibition, alteration of DNA Repair pathways, Immunotherapy, cancer Metabolism and targeting the Extracellular tumour microenvironment.

AB Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a particularly insidious and aggressive disease that causes significant mortality worldwide. The direct correlation between PDAC incidence, disease progression, and mortality highlights the critical need to understand the mechanisms by which PDAC cells rapidly progress to drive metastatic disease in order to identify actionable vulnerabilities. One such proposed vulnerability is epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), a process whereby neoplastic epithelial cells delaminate from their neighbours, either collectively or individually, allowing for their subsequent invasion into host tissue. This disruption of tissue homeostasis, particularly in PDAC, further promotes cellular transformation by inducing inflammatory interactions with the stromal compartment, which in turn contributes to intratumoural heterogeneity. This review describes the role of EMP in PDAC, and the preclinical target discovery that has been conducted to identify the molecular regulators and effectors of this EMP program. While inhibition of individual targets may provide therapeutic insights, a single 'master-key' remains elusive, making their collective interactions of greater importance in controlling the behaviours' of heterogeneous tumour cell populations. Much work has been undertaken to understand key transcriptional programs that drive EMP in certain contexts, however, a collaborative appreciation for the subtle, context-dependent programs governing EMP regulation is needed in order to design therapeutic strategies to curb PDAC mortality.

AB Previous studies from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)project have adopted commercial pan-cancer cell line models to identify drug sensitivity biomarkers. However, drug sensitivity biomarkers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have not been widely explored. Here, eight patient-derived cell lines (PDCs) are successfully established from 123 patients withESCC. The mutation profiling of PDCs can partially recapture the tumor tissue actionable mutations from 161 patients withESCC. Based on these mutations and relative pathways in eight PDCs, 46 targeted drugs are selected for screening. Interestingly, some drug and biomarker relationships are established that were not discovered in the CCLE project. For example, CDKN2A or CDKN2B loss is significantly associated with the sensitivity of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Furthermore, both PDC xenografts and patient-derived xenografts confirm CDKN2A/2B loss as a biomarker predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor sensitivity. Collectively, patient-derived models could predict targeted drug sensitivity associated with actionable mutations in ESCC.

AB Cancer can be conceptualized as arising from somatic mutations resulting in a single renegade cell escaping from the constraints of multicellularity. Thus, the era of precision medicine has led to intense focus on the cancer cell to target these mutations that result in oncogenic signaling and sustain malignancy. However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) there are only four abundantly common driver mutations (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4), which are not currently actionable. Thus, precision therapy for PDAC must look beyond the cancer cell. In fact, PDAC is more than a collection of renegade cells, instead representing an extensive, supportive ecosystem, having developed over several years, and consisting of numerous interactions between the cancer cells, normal mesenchymal cells, immune cells, and the dense extracellular matrix. In this issue, Huang and colleagues demonstrate how elucidation of these complex relationships within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can be exploited for therapeutic intervention in PDAC. They identify in a subset of PDAC with mutations in TGFbeta signaling, that a paracrine signaling axis can be abrogated to modulate the TME and improve outcomes. © 2019 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND: Disruptive and unprofessional behaviors occur frequently in health care and adversely affect patient care and health care worker job satisfaction. These behaviors have rarely been evaluated at a work setting level, nor do we fully understand how disruptive behaviors (DBs) are associated with important metrics such as teamwork and safety climate, work-life balance, burnout, and depression.; OBJECTIVES: Using a cross-sectional survey of all health care workers in a large US health system, this study aimed to introduce a brief scale for evaluating DBs at a work setting level, evaluate the scale's psychometric properties and provide benchmarking prevalence data from the health care system, and investigate associations between DBs and other validated measures of safety culture and well-being.; RESULTS: One or more of six DBs were reported by 97.8% of work settings. DBs were reported in similar frequencies by men and women, and by most health care worker roles. The six-item disruptive behavior scale demonstrated an internal consistency of alpha = 0.867. DB climate was significantly correlated with poorer teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction, and perceptions of management; lower work-life balance; increased emotional exhaustion (burnout); and increased depression (p < 0.001 for each). A 10-unit increase in DB climate was associated with a 3.89- and 3.83-point decrease in teamwork and safety climate, respectively, and a 3.16- and 2.42-point increase in burnout and depression, respectively.; CONCLUSION: Disruptive behaviors are common, measurable, and associated with safety culture and health care worker well-being. This concise DB scale affords researchers a new, valid, and actionable tool to assess DBs. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Genome sequencing is positioned as a routine clinical work-up for diverse clinical conditions. A commonly used approach to highlight candidate variants with potential clinical implication is to search over locus- and gene-centric knowledge databases. Most web-based applications allow a federated query across diverse databases for a single variant; however, sifting through a large number of genomic variants with combination of filtering criteria is a substantial challenge. Here we describe the Clinical Genome and Ancestry Report (CGAR), an interactive web application developed to follow clinical interpretation workflows by organizing variants into seven categories: (1) reported disease-associated variants, (2) rare and high-impact variants in putative disease-associated genes, (3) secondary findings which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommends reporting back to patients, (4) actionable pharmacogenomic variants, (5) focused reports for candidate genes, (6) de novo variant candidates for trio analysis, and (7) germline and somatic variants implicated in cancer risk, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. For each variant, a comprehensive list of external links to variant-centric and phenotype databases are provided. Furthermore, genotype-derived ancestral composition is used to highlight allele frequencies from a matched population since some disease-associated variants show a wide variation between populations.

AB FebriDx is a rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test that is designed to aid in the differentiation of bacterial and viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), thus helping to guide decisions regarding the prescription of antibiotics in the outpatient setting. FebriDx carries a CE mark for use in the EU and is also approved in several other countries, including Canada, Saudi Arabia and Singapore. It is indicated for use in patients >2years old with symptoms consistent with a community-acquired ARI. The test involves the use of an immunoassay on a fingerstick blood sample to provide simultaneous, qualitative measurement of elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA). In two prospective, multicentre studies in patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections, FebriDx was shown to be both sensitive and specific in identifying patients with a clinically significant infection and in differentiating between infections of bacterial and viral aetiology. The test is simple, requires no additional equipment and produces actionable results in ~10min. As was demonstrated in a small, retrospective analysis, FebriDx results can help guide (improve) antibiotic prescribing decisions. Reducing the unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for ARIs of probable viral aetiology is important for antibiotic stewardship and can also reduce the unnecessary exposure of patients to the risk of antibiotic-related adverse events. FebriDx thus represents a useful diagnostic tool in the outpatient setting.

AB To help address health care disparities and promote higher quality, culturally sensitive care in the United States, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and other governing bodies propose cultivating a more diverse physician workforce. In addition, improved training and patient outcomes have been demonstrated for diverse care teams. However, prioritizing graduate medical education (GME) diversity and inclusion efforts can be challenging and unidimensional diversity initiatives typically result in failure.Little literature exists regarding actionable steps to promote diversity in GME. Building on existing literature and the authors' experiences at different institutions, the authors propose a 5-point inclusive recruitment framework for diversifying GME training programs. This article details each of the 5 steps of the framework, which begins with strong institutional support by setting diversity as a priority. Forming a cycle, the other four steps are seeking out candidates, implementing inclusive recruitment practices, investing in trainee success, and building the pipeline. Practical strategies for each step and recommendations for measurable outcomes for continued support for this work are provided. The proposed framework may better equip colleagues and leaders in academic medicine to prioritize and effectively promote diversity and inclusion in GME at their respective institutions.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, representing the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. HCC genetic characterization at the tumor level has been recently completed, highlighting how a number of genes are frequently mutated in this pathology. Actionable somatic mutations found in a HCC tumor may represent targets for innovative drugs as well as prognostic/predictive markers. Nonetheless, surgical or bioptic tissue is hardly accessible in HCC and a single tumor sample is poorly representative of the tumor genetic heterogeneity. In this context, analyzing the circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) and its tumor-derived fraction (ctDNA) could represent a promising strategy of liquid biopsy. Recent data suggested that the fluctuation of the ccfDNA quantity in the plasma of HCC patients could anticipate the detection of tumor progression. The presence of somatic mutations in p53 signaling, Wnt/beta-catenin, chromatin remodeling, response to oxidative stress and telomerase maintenance pathways can also be studied in ccfDNA bypassing the need to perform a tumor biopsy. The profiling of ccfDNA fragmentation and the methylation pattern could further improve the clinical management of HCC patients. Performing a dynamic monitoring in the course of systemic treatment with sorafenib or regorafenib is a possible way to provide insights into the resistance mechanism, and to identify predictive and prognostic genetic alterations, helping the clinicians in terms of treatment decision making. This review will discuss the most recent literature data about the use of ccfDNA to monitor and improve the treatment of HCC.

AB Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a neoplastic condition composed of immature myeloid cells involving an extramedullary site. We investigated underlying chromosomal and molecular alterations to assess potential molecular markers of prognosis and outcome in this rare pediatric disease. We conducted a retrospective review of clinicopathologic and cytogenetic data from 33 pediatric patients with MS (ages 1month-18years) at our institution over a 32year period (1984-2016). Tissue-based cancer microarray and targeted next-generation sequencing analysis were performed on six cases. The median age at diagnosis was 2.8years with a male-to-female ratio of 2.6:1. MS is commonly presented with concomitant marrow involvement (n=12, 36.4%) or as a recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=14, 42.4%). The skin (n=18, 54.5%) and soft tissue (n=9, 27.3%) were the most common sites of involvement. Twenty-one of 25 samples (84.0%) harbored chromosomal aberrations; KMT2A alterations (n=10, 40.0%) or complex cytogenetics (n=7, 28.0%) were most frequent. Mutations in RAS, tyrosine kinase, cell signaling, and chromatin remodeling genes were detected. When compared to pediatric patients with AML without extramedullary involvement (EMI), inferior overall survival (OS) was observed (18.8months vs. 89.3months, p=.008). Pediatric patients with MS with non-favorable cytogenetics [abnormalities other than t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), or t(15;17)] had a significantly lower OS compared to patients with AML with non-favorable cytogenetics and no extramedullary involvement (8.0months vs. 28.1months, p<.001). Pediatric MS is a rare disease with diverse clinical presentations. Non-favorable cytogenetics may be a poor prognostic marker for pediatric patients with MS and molecular diagnostics can assist with risk stratification and identify potentially actionable targets.

AB Costello syndrome (CS) is an autosomal-dominant condition caused by activating missense mutations in HRAS. There is little literature describing health concerns specific to adults with CS. Parents of individuals with CS need to know what to anticipate as their children age. We surveyed a group of 20 adults and older adolescents with CS regarding their medical concerns and lifestyle characteristics. We identified several previously undescribed actionable medical concerns in adults with CS. First, the high prevalence of anxiety in this cohort indicates that screening for anxiety is warranted since this is a treatable condition that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Second, adults with CS should be monitored for progressive contractures or other problems that could decrease mobility. This is especially important in a population that seems to have increased risk for osteopenia. Finally, the lack of cancer diagnoses in adulthood is of interest, although the cohort is too small to draw definitive conclusions about cancer risk in adults with CS. Ongoing follow-up of the current cohort of adults with CS is necessary to delineate progressive medical and physical problems, which is essential for providing targeted management recommendations and anticipatory guidance to families. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB OBJECTIVES: A consensus study from 2017 developed 15 response-specific quality indicators (QIs) for physician-staffed emergency medical services (P-EMS). The aim of this study was to test these QIs for important characteristics in a real clinical setting. These characteristics were feasibility, rankability, variability, actionability and documentation. We further aimed to propose benchmarks for future quality measurements in P-EMS.; DESIGN: In this prospective observational study, physician-staffed helicopter emergency services registered data for the 15 QIs. The feasibility of the QIs was assessed based on the comments of the recording physicians. The other four QI characteristics were assessed by the authors. Benchmarks were proposed based on the quartiles in the dataset.; SETTING: Nordic physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical services.; PARTICIPANTS: 16 physician-staffed helicopter emergency services in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.; RESULTS: The dataset consists of 5638 requests to the participating P-EMSs. There were 2814 requests resulting in completed responses with patient contact. All QIs were feasible to obtain. The variability of 14 out of 15 QIs was adequate. Rankability was adequate for all QIs. Actionability was assessed as being adequate for 10 QIs. Documentation was adequate for 14 QIs. Benchmarks for all QIs were proposed.; CONCLUSIONS: All 15 QIs seem possible to use in everyday quality measurement and improvement. However, it seems reasonable to not analyse the QI 'Adverse Events' with a strictly quantitative approach because of a low rate of adverse events. Rather, this QI should be used to identify adverse events so that they can be analysed as sentinel events. The actionability of the QIs 'Able to respond immediately when alarmed', 'Time to arrival of P-EMS', 'Time to preferred destination', 'Provision of advanced treatment' and 'Significant logistical contribution' was assessed as being poor. Benchmarks for the QIs and a total quality score are proposed for future quality measurements. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB Prenatal cell-free DNA screening (cfDNA) provides moregenetic risk information about the fetus than has ever been possible. At the same time, the rapid expansion of new cfDNA panels raises important questions about how to structure patient-centered discussions that best support patients' decision-making about its use. To address this question, we conducted interviews with pregnant patients to identify decision-making needs and preferences with respect to cfDNA in patient-centered healthcare discussions, given its evolving capability to identify a range of fetal variants. Personal utility was a core concept guiding decision-making. Participants spoke of how their deeply personal values and beliefs about maternal responsibility, actionability, and tolerance of uncertainty framed their view of the personal utility of cfDNA screening. While discussing their notions of personal utility with their healthcare provider, participants also had concerns about potential ramifications for the provider-patient relationship and shared decision-making when disclosing values and preferences regarding disability, quality of life, and termination-particularly as it becomes possible to identify variants with different disease-associated severity and outcomes. The complexities associated with the introduction of genomics in prenatal care present unique challenges to structuring effective shared decision-making discussions between patients and their healthcare providers. While efforts are underway to determine how to best educate patients about the medical aspects of cfDNA, it is equally important to develop approaches in healthcare communication that enable patients to make informed, values-based decisions about the use of cfDNA and its impact on their pregnancy. © 2019 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB With an increasing number of antimicrobial stewardship-related articles published each year, attempting to stay current is challenging. The Southeastern Research Group Endeavor (SERGE-45) identified antimicrobial stewardship-related peer-reviewed literature that detailed an actionable intervention for 2018. The top 13 publications were selected using a modified Delphi technique. These manuscripts were reviewed to highlight the actionable intervention used by antimicrobial stewardship programs to provide key stewardship literature for teaching and training as well as to identify potential intervention opportunities within one's institution. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB PURPOSE: The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Actionability Working Group (AWG) developed a semiquantitative scoring metric to rate clinical actionability of genetic disorders and associated genes in four domains: (1) severity of the outcome, (2) likelihood of the outcome, (3) effectiveness of the intervention to prevent/minimize the outcome, and (4) nature of the intervention with respect to burden, risk, tolerability, and acceptability to the patient. This study aimed to assess whether nature of the intervention scores assigned by AWG experts reflected lay perceptions of intervention burden, risk, tolerability, and acceptability given the subjectivity of this domain.; METHODS: In July 2017, a general population sample of 1344 adults completed the study. Each participant was asked to read 1 of 24 plain language medical intervention synopses and answer questions related to its burden, risk, tolerability, and acceptability. We conducted three multilevel mixed model analyses predicting the perceived burden, perceived risk, and perceived overall nature of the intervention.; RESULTS: As AWG nature of the intervention scores increased, lay perceptions of intervention burden and risk decreased, and perceptions of tolerability and acceptability increased.; CONCLUSION: The findings show alignment between the ClinGen actionability scoring metric and lay perceptions of the nature of the intervention.

AB PURPOSE: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) session attendance and rates of completion remain suboptimal. Greater distress (ie, depression and anxiety) has been associated with both better and poorer adherence. Will to live (ie, desire, determination and effort to survive) has been associated with survival among cardiac patients and thus may be relevant for CR adherence. It was hypothesized that depression and anxiety would be negatively associated with adherence, and that will to live would moderate these relationships.; METHODS: Sixty patients (mean age = 56.9 ± 10.8 yr; 38 males) entering outpatient CR completed self-report measures of will to live (Wish to Prolong Life Questionnaire) and distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to predict CR session attendance (%) and program completion (yes/no) from depression and anxiety, as well as the interaction of those variables with will to live.; RESULTS: Neither depression nor anxiety was associated with CR adherence (Ps > .33). However, there was a significant interaction of will to live with anxiety in predicting attendance (beta= -0.31, P = .03, Model R = .19, P = .01), reflecting that anxiety predicted lower attendance only among patients reporting greater will to live.; CONCLUSIONS: These data help clarify the complex relationship between distress and CR adherence. Findings suggest that higher anxiety is associated with poorer adherence, but only in combination with greater motivation for living. Patients higher in anxiety and will to live may benefit from additional strategies to make actionable behavioral change in the context of CR.

AB OBJECTIVE: To select optimal therapies based on the detection of actionable genomic alterations in tumor samples is a major challenge in precision medicine.; METHODS: We describe an effective process (opened December 1, 2017) that combines comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic tumor profiling, custom algorithms and visualization software for data integration, and preclinical 3-dimensiona exvivo models for drug screening to assess response to therapeutic agents targeting specific genomic alterations. The process was applied to a patient with widely metastatic, weakly hormone receptor positive, HER2 nonamplified, infiltrating lobular breast cancer refractory to standard therapy.; RESULTS: Clinical testing of liver metastasis identified BRIP1, NF1, CDH1, RB1, and TP53 mutations pointing to potential therapies including PARP, MEK/RAF, and CDK inhibitors. The comprehensive genomic analysis identified 395 mutations and several structural rearrangements that resulted in loss of function of 36 genes. Meta-analysis revealed biallelic inactivation of TP53, CDH1, FOXA1, and NIN, whereas only one allele of NF1 and BRIP1 was mutated. A novel ERBB2 somatic mutation of undetermined significance (P702L), high expression of both mutated and wild-type ERBB2 transcripts, high expression of ERBB3, and a LITAF-BCAR4 fusion resulting in BCAR4 overexpression pointed toward ERBB-related therapies. Exvivo analysis validated the ERBB-related therapies and invalidated therapies targeting mutations in BRIP1 and NF1. Systemic patient therapy with afatinib, a HER1/HER2/HER4 small molecule inhibitor, resulted in a near complete radiographic response by 3 months.; CONCLUSION: Unlike clinical testing, the combination of tumor profiling, data integration, and functional validation accurately assessed driver alterations and predicted effective treatment.

AB Thymomas comprise a group of rare epithelial neoplasms of the anterior mediastinum. Whereas localized disease carries a favorable prognosis, the majority of patients with metastatic thymomas experience progression or recurrence over a 10-year period. Although targeted therapies have become standard of care in many malignancies, no clinically actionable mutations have consistently been identified in metastatic thymomas. Here, we describe a patient with an aggressive thymoma complicated by extensive pleural metastases. Over a 16-year period, she progressed on multiple treatment regimens. To identify additional treatment options, tissue from a pleural metastasis was sent for next-generation sequencing, revealing mutations in BRCA2, tyrosine kinase 2, and SET domain containing 2. Based on supporting evidence for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in other BRCA-mutated tumors, the patient was started on the PARP inhibitor olaparib. She derived significant clinical benefit from treatment, with imaging showing overall stabilization of her disease. Here, we review the genotyping results of her tumor and discuss the functional and clinical significance of the mutations in her cancer as well as implications for managing patients with advanced BRCA-mutant thymomas. KEY POINTS: Targeted therapy has yet to enter the standard clinical management of metastatic thymomas.Patients with BRCA2-mutant thymomas may benefit from poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB A substantial body of literature has shown robust associations between prenatal smoking exposure and DNA methylation levels. The pattern of DNA methylation can be used as a molecular signature of past prenatal smoking exposure and might also provide mechanistic insights into associations between prenatal smoking exposure and adverse health outcomes. In this issue of the Journal, Cardenas et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;188(11):1878-1886) evaluated whether DNA methylation mediates the association between prenatal smoking and low birth weight in a tissue that is mechanistically relevant to birth weight-the placenta-using formal mediation analyses. They found that methylation levels, at 5 loci, mediated smoking exposure effects on birth weight but only among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Given the use of formal mediation methods and measurement in a mechanistically relevant tissue, this work has the potential to inform novel directions for intervention. Replication of these findings in larger and more racially and ethnically diverse samples, repeated measures to better tease apart the timing of DNA methylation changes with respect to exposure and birth weight, and continued use of intervention-focused mediation methods are needed before the impact of these findings will be fully realized. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Aims: This quality analysis study was designed to review the indications, reports, and clinical consequences of 438 diagnostic next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel analyses for hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTD). Methods: Molecular analyses were retrieved from laboratory databases and patient records, and compared to the clinical information in the requisition and classified according to the Human Phenotype Ontology. Results: In 123 of 438 NGS analyses, 156 sequence variants were reported in 33 of 54 genes analyzed. NGS analyses and, in some cases, postanalytic assessment resulted in identification of pathogenic variants in 40 (9%) of patients, and variants of uncertain significance were identified in 83 (19%) of cases analyzed. While cardiovascular abnormalities were the most common phenotype noted in the requisitions, no specific organ system could be identified in which the reported symptoms provided an actionable indication for the analysis. Certain health issues recorded in the patients' records were found to be frequently left out of requisitions. Conclusions: The interpretation of genetic sequence variants continues to be a significant challenge in HCTD. Although not associated with the highest diagnostic yield, cardiovascular disease and family history may be suitable indications for NGS due to the clinical consequences of the identification of a known or likely causative sequence variant for a vascular HCTD in patients and relatives.

AB PURPOSE: Newborn screening (NBS) programs are important for appropriate management of susceptible neonates to prevent serious clinical problems. Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are at a potentially high risk of false-positive results, and repetitive NBS after total parenteral nutrition is completely off results in delayed diagnosis. Here, we present the usefulness of a targeted next-generation sequencing (TNGS) panel to complement NBS for early diagnosis in high-risk neonates.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TNGS panel covered 198 genes associated with actionable genetic and metabolic diseases that are typically included in NBS programs in Korea using tandem mass spectrometry. The panel was applied to 48 infants admitted to the NICU of Severance Children's Hospital between May 2017 and September 2017. The infants were not selected for suspected metabolic disorders.; RESULTS: A total of 13 variants classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic were detected in 11 (22.9%) neonates, including six genes (DHCR7, PCBD1, GAA, ALDOB, ATP7B, and GBA) associated with metabolic diseases not covered in NBS. One of the 48 infants was diagnosed with an isobutyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, and false positive results of tandem mass screening were confirmed in two infants using the TNGS panel.; CONCLUSION: The implementation of TNGS in conjunction with conventional NBS can allow for better management of and earlier diagnosis in susceptible infants, thus preventing the development of critical conditions in these sick infants. © Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: For children with cancer, the clinical integration of precision medicine to enable predictive biomarker-based therapeutic stratification is urgently needed.; METHODS: We have developed a hybrid-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel, specifically designed to detect genetic alterations in paediatric solid tumours, which gives reliable results from as little as 50ng of DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. In this study, we offered an NGS panel, with clinical reporting via a molecular tumour board for children with solid tumours. Furthermore, for a cohort of 12 patients, we used a circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA)-specific panel to sequence ctDNA from matched plasma samples and compared plasma and tumour findings.; RESULTS: A total of 255 samples were submitted from 223 patients for the NGS panel. Using FFPE tissue, 82% of all submitted samples passed quality control for clinical reporting. At least one genetic alteration was detected in 70% of sequenced samples. The overall detection rate of clinically actionable alterations, defined by modified OncoKB criteria, for all sequenced samples was 51%. A total of 8 patients were sequenced at different stages of treatment. In 6 of these, there were differences in the genetic alterations detected between time points. Sequencing of matched ctDNA in a cohort of extracranial paediatric solid tumours also identified a high detection rate of somatic alterations in plasma.; CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that tailored clinical molecular profiling of both tumour DNA and plasma-derived ctDNA is feasible for children with solid tumours. Furthermore, we show that a targeted NGS panel-based approach can identify actionable genetic alterations in a high proportion of patients. Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Outcomes after mastectomy and prosthetic-based breast reconstruction have improved immensely since the development of the first tissue expander and breast implant in the 1960s. One major factor contributing to our improved outcomes over the past two decades is the increasing availability and improvement of perfusion assessment technology. Instrumental methods now exist which allow surgeons to assess tissue viability intraoperatively, and provide actionable, objective data that augments clinical assessment. In this article, the authors detail two commercially available, state-of-the-art technologies that surgeons may use to assist in mastectomy flap assessment and facilitate the reconstructive process. © Thieme Medical Publishers.

AB This expert review offers a critical synthesis of the latest insights and approaches at targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in various cancers such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and breast and lung cancers. Notably, from organogenesis to cancer, the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling displays varied and highly versatile biological functions in animals, with virtually all tissues requiring the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in one way or the other. Aberrant expression of the members of the Wnt/beta-catenin has been implicated in many pathological conditions, particularly in human cancers. Mutations in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway genes have been noted in diverse cancers. Biochemical and genetic data support the idea that inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is beneficial in cancer therapeutics. The interaction of this important pathway with other signaling systems is also noteworthy, but remains as an area for further research and discovery. In addition, formation of different complexes by components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the precise roles of these complexes in the cytoplasmic milieu are yet to be fully elucidated. This article highlights the latest medical technologies in imaging, single-cell omics, use of artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning techniques), genome sequencing, quantum computing, molecular docking, and computational softwares in modeling interactions between molecules and predicting protein-protein and compound-protein interactions pertinent to the biology and therapeutic value of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. We discuss these emerging technologies in relationship to what is currently needed to move from concept to actionable strategies in translating the Wnt/beta-catenin laboratory discoveries to Wnt-targeted cancer therapies and diagnostics in the clinic.

AB BACKGROUND: A randomised trial SHIVA01 compared the efficacy of matched molecularly targeted therapy outside their indications based on a prespecified treatment algorithm versus conventional chemotherapy in patients with metastatic solid tumours who had failed standard of care. No statistical difference was reported between the two groups in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), challenging treatment algorithm. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) recently defined criteria to prioritise molecular alterations (MAs) to select anticancer drugs. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of matched molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) given in SHIVA01 according to ESCAT tiers.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: MAs used in SHIVA01 were retrospectively classified into ESCAT tiers, and PFS and overall survival (OS) were compared using log-rank tests.; RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients were treated with matched MTAs in SHIVA01. MAs used to allocate MTAs were classified into tiers II, IIIA, IIIBand IVA according to the ESCAT. Median PFS was 2.0 months in tier II, 3.1 in tier IIIA, 1.7 in tier IIIBand 3.2 in tier IVA (p=0.13). Median OS in tier IIIB was worse than that in tiers II, IIIA and IVA (6.3 months versus 11.7, 11.2 and 12.1, p=0.002).; CONCLUSIONS: Most MAs used to allocate therapy in SHIVA01 were shown to improve outcomes in other tumour types (tier IIIA). Worst outcome was observed in patients treated based on another type of alteration than the one reported to improve outcomes (tier IIIB), highlighting the crucial impact of the type of the alterations beyond the gene and the signalling pathway.

AB BACKGROUND: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have recently been approved among patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who failed platinum therapy. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of selected immune gene expression in HNSCC.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the expression of 46 immune-related genes and immune-cell subpopulation genes including immune checkpoints by real-time polymerase chain reaction among 96 patients with HNSCC who underwent primary surgery at Institut Curie between 1990 and 2006. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of dysregulated genes.; RESULTS: The Median age of the population was 56 years [range: 35-78]. Primary tumour location was oral cavity (45%), oropharynx (21%), larynx (18%)and hypopharynx (17%). Twelve patients (13%) had an oropharyngeal human papillomavirus-positive tumour. Most significantly overexpressed immune-related genes were TNFRSF9/4-1BB (77%), IDO1 (75%), TNFSF4/OX40L (74%) and TNFRSF18/GITR (74%), and immune-cell subpopulation gene was FOXP3 (62%). Eighty-five percent of tumours analysed overexpressed actionable immunity genes, including PD-1/PD-L1, TIGIT, OX40/OX40L and/or CTLA4. Among the immune-related genes, high OX40L mRNA level (p=0.0009) and low PD-1 mRNA level (p=0.004) were associated with the highest risk of recurrence. Among the immune-cell subpopulation genes, patients with high PDGFRB mRNA level (p<0.0001) and low CD3E (p=0.0009) or CD8A mRNA levels (p=0.004) were also at the highest risk of recurrence.; CONCLUSIONS: OX40L and PDGFRB overexpression was associated with poor outcomes, whereas PD-1 overexpression was associated with good prognosis in patients with HNSCC treated with primary surgery, suggesting their relevance as potential prognostic biomarkers and major therapeutic targets.

AB The overall objectives of this review are to summarize actionable biomarkers for organic etiology of lower functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) that lead to individualized treatment for their FGIDs and to assess the pipeline for novel approaches to the management of constipation, diarrhea, and chronic abdominal pain in lower FGIDs. The new approaches to therapy include ion exchangers/transporters for functional constipation (sodium-glucose cotransporter 1, Na+/H+ exchanger 3, and solute carrier family 26 member 3 inhibitors), bile acid modulators for constipation such as ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors and fibroblast growth factor 19 analog for functional constipation, and bile acid sequestrants or farnesoid X receptor agonists for functional diarrhea. Treatment for chronic abdominal pain remains an unmet need in patients with lower FGIDs, and promising novel approaches include delayed-release linaclotide, nonclassical opioid visceral analgesics, and selective cannabinoid receptor agonists. The role of probiotics, fecal microbial transplantation, and possible future microbiome therapies is discussed.

AB INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of violence to first responders is reported in ranges of approximately 40% to 90%. Pennsylvania has a felonious assault statute to address such violence, but the prosecutorial process has been noted to cause first-responder dissatisfaction.; METHODS: An exploratory qualitative study using individual interviews with snowball sampling was conducted with the Philadelphia District Attorney's office to understand the prosecutorial process when a first responder is assaulted and injured in a line of duty. The Philadelphia Fire Department provided a list of first responders who sustained a work-related injury from a patient or bystander assault so that particular cases could be discussed during the interviews.; RESULTS: Emergent themes fell into two categories: factors that lead to a charge (prosecutorial merit, intent, and victim investment), and the judge's discretion in sentencing ("part of the job" mentality, concern for the defendant, and the justice system's offender focus). Immediately actionable tertiary prevention recommendations for fire departments, labor unions, and district attorney's offices were developed.; CONCLUSION: Violence against fire-based emergency medical service (EMS) responders is a persistent and preventable workplace hazard. While felonious assault statutes express society's value that it is unacceptable to harm a first responder, this study found that such statutes failed to provide satisfaction to victims and that support when going through the court process is lacking. Assaulted EMS responders, their employers, and labor unions would benefit from the recommendations provided herein to help them extract a stronger sense of procedural justice from the legal process. © 2019 The Authors.

AB INTRODUCTION: Multiple oncogene fusions beyond ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), RET, and ROS1 fusion hasbeen described in lung cancer, especially in lung adenocarcinomas without common oncogenic mutations. Molecular inhibitors have been developed and proved effective for patients whose tumors harbor these novel alterations.; METHODS: A consecutive series of surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas were collected and profiled using an enrichment strategy to detect nine common oncogenic driver mutations and fusions concerning EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, MET, ALK, RET, ROS1, and FGFR. Driver-negative cases were further analyzed by a comprehensive RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) fusion assay for novel fusions.; RESULTS: In total, we profiled 1681 lung adenocarcinomas, among which 255 cases were common driver-negative. One hundred seventy-seven cases had sufficient tissue for NGS fusions screening, which identified eight novel fusions. NRG1 fusions occurred in 0.36% of all lung adenocarcinoma cases (6 of 1681 cases), including 4 CD74-NRG1-positive cases, 1 RBPMS-NRG1-positive case, and 1 novel ITGB1-NRG1-positive case. Furthermore, another 2 novel fusions were also detected, including 1 EGFR-SHC1 fusion and 1 CD47-MET fusion, both of which were in-frame and retained the functional domain of the corresponding kinases. No fusion event was detected for NTRK, KRAS, BRAF or HER2 genes in this cohort. Detailed clinicopathologic data showed that invasive mucous adenocarcinoma (three of eight cases) and acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma (three of eight cases) were the most prevalent pathologic subtypes among novel fusions.; CONCLUSIONS: Fusions affecting NRG1, EGFR, and MET were detected in 0.48% of unselected lung adenocarcinomas, and NRG1 fusions ranked the most prevalent fusions in common driver-negative lung adenocarcinomas from Chinese population. RNA-based NGS fusion assay was an optional method for screening actionable fusions in common driver-negative cases. Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

AB EGFR signaling confers resistance to radiotherapy and is a validated target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The inhibition of EGFR in combination with radiotherapy improves local control and overall survival in these patients; however, therapeutic resistance limits the efficacy of this approach. We therefore sought to identify cellular mechanisms that cause resistance to EGFR inhibition and radiotherapy in HNSCC. Though clonal isolation of carcinoma cells exposed to increasing concentrations of cetuximab, we found that resistant cells upregulate prosurvival ErbB3 and AKT signaling. Using EFM-19 cells and confirmatory analysis of protein levels, we demonstrate that cetuximab resistance is characterized by enhanced neuregulin expression identifying a novel adaptive mechanism of therapeutic resistance. Inhibition of this autocrine loop with CDX-3379 (an ErbB3 specific antibody) was sufficient to block ErbB3/AKT signaling in cetuximab resistant cells. The combination of CDX-3379 and cetuximab reduced proliferation and survival after radiotherapy in several HNSCC cell lines. These in vitro findings were confirmed in xenograft tumor growth experiments including an approach using growth factor-supplemented Matrigel. In vivo, the delivery of EGFR and ErbB3 antibodies significantly reduced tumor growth in cetuximab-resistant FaDu and CAL27 xenografts. In summary, this work demonstrates that autocrine NRG ligand secretion is a mechanism for therapeutic resistance to cetuximab and radiotherapy. This cross-resistance to both therapeutic modalities identifies NRG as an actionable therapeutic target for improving treatment regimens in HNSCC. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: Early detection and intervention can decrease the mortality of breast cancer significantly. Assessments of genetic/genomic variants in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have generated great enthusiasm for their potential application as clinically actionable biomarkers in the management of early-stage breast cancer.Experimental Design: In this study, 861 serial plasma and matched tissue specimens from 102 patients with early-stage breast cancer who need chemotherapy and 50 individuals with benign breast tumors were deeply sequenced via next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques using large gene panels.; RESULTS: Cancer tissues in this cohort of patients showed profound intratumor heterogeneities (ITHGs) that were properly reflected by ctDNA testing. Integrating the ctDNA detection rate of 74.2% in this cohort with the corresponding predictive results based on Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification (BI-RADS) could increase the positive predictive value up to 92% and potentially dramatically reduce surgical overtreatment. Patients with positive ctDNA after surgery showed a higher percentage of lymph node metastasis, indicating potential recurrence and remote metastasis. The ctDNA-positive rates were significantly decreased after chemotherapy in basal-like and Her2+ tumor subtypes, but were persistent despite chemotherapy in luminal type. The tumor mutation burden in blood (bTMB) assessed on the basis of ctDNA testing was positively correlated with the TMB in tumor tissues (tTMB), providing a candidate biomarker warranting further study of its potentials used for precise immunotherapy in cancer.; CONCLUSIONS: These data showed that ctDNA evaluation is a feasible, sensitive, and specific biomarker for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with early-stage breast cancer who need chemotherapy. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: To optimise care of deteriorating patients, healthcare organisations have implemented rapid response systems including an "afferent" and "efferent" limb. Afferent limb behaviours include monitoring vital signs and escalating care. To strengthen afferent limb behaviour and reduce adverse patient outcomes, the National Early Warning Score was implemented in the UK. There are no published reports of how National Early Warning Score guidance has translated into trust-level deteriorating patient policy and whether these documents provide clear, actionable statements guiding staff.; AIM: To identify how deteriorating patient policy documents provide "actionable" behavioural instruction for staff, responsible for actioning the afferent limb of the rapid response system.; DESIGN: A structured content analysis of a national guideline and local policies using a behaviour specification framework.; METHODS: Local deteriorating patient policies were obtained. Statements of behaviour were extracted from policies; coded using a behaviour specification framework: Target, Action, Context, Timing and Actor and scored for specificity (1=present, nonspecific; 2=present, specific). Frequencies and proportions of statements containing elements of the Target, Action, Context, Timing and Actor framework were summarised descriptively. Reporting was guided by the COREQ checklist.; RESULTS: There were more statements related to monitoring than escalation behaviour (65% vs 35%). Despite high levels of clear specification of the action (94%) and the target of the behaviour (74%), context, timing and actor were poorly specified (37%, 37% and 33%).; CONCLUSION: Delay in escalating deteriorating patients is associated with adverse outcomes. Some delay could be addressed by writing local protocols with greater behavioural specificity, to facilitate actionability.; RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Numerous clinical staff are required for an effective response to patient deterioration. To mitigate role confusion, local policy writers should provide clear specification of the actor. As the behaviours are time-sensitive, clear specification of the time frame may increase actionability of policy statements for clinical staff. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Mutational status for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF genes should be performed on all colorectal carcinoma (CRC) specimens in order to guide targeted therapy selection for metastatic disease. Mutations are typically assessed via polymerase chain reaction and/or next generation sequencing (NGS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. With minimally invasive diagnostic methodologies, the cytology cell pellet obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can serve as an alternative source of tumor deoxyribonucleic acid.; METHODS: An electronic record review of the cytopathology files (CoPathPlus, Cerner Corp., North Kansas City, Missouri) from September 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018 was conducted. All cytology specimens obtained via FNA and diagnosed as metastatic CRC on which NGS was performed were included. NGS for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations using the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2.0 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) was performed on cytology cell pellets.; RESULTS: Forty-eight cases were identified. Forty-six of 48 specimens (96%) were adequate for molecular testing. Of those adequate specimens, proportion of malignant cells in the sample ranged from 5% to 95% (mean 46%). Twenty-seven of 48 cases (56%) were positive for clinically relevant mutations. Twenty-four of 27 cases (89%) were positive for KRAS mutations, with exon 2 most frequently involved (22/24 cases, 92%). Two of 27 cases (7%) were positive for NRAS mutations and one case (1/27, 4%) was positive for a BRAF mutation involving codon 594.; CONCLUSION: Mutational analysis performed on cytology cell pellets serves as a useful means of gathering clinically actionable information on tumor mutation status in metastatic CRC. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Complex cancer operations performed at high-volume and teaching hospitals have been associated with better outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the national trends in the performance of these operations at large teaching hospitals.; METHODS: Patients who underwent elective esophagectomies, gastrectomies, pancreatectomies, and hepatectomies for cancer (2003-2015) were identified using the National Inpatient Sample. We determined average annual percent change (AAPC) in the proportion of operations at large teaching hospitals, inpatient complications, length of stay (LOS), and inpatient mortality.; RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2015, 38,932 esophageal, 104,941 gastric, 96,098 hepatic, and 137,440 pancreatic cancer resections were performed. The proportion at large teaching hospitals increased with an AAPC of 2.5 for esophagectomies (P < .001), 3.6 for gastrectomies (P < .001), and 1.5 for pancreatectomies (P= .039), but did not change for hepatectomies (AAPC 0.48, P= .50). During the study period, mean LOS and inpatient mortality rates at large teaching hospitals decreased across hospital types. By 2013 to 2015, the operations at large hospitals were associated with decreased mortality only for pancreatectomies (odds ratio, 0.62, 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.91, P= .015).; CONCLUSIONS: Complex cancer operations are performed increasingly at large teaching hospitals, but perioperative outcomes have improved nationally across hospital types. Further studies should identify actionable areas for improvement to ensure accessible quality cancer care. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The recent development of cancer precision medicine is associated with the emergence of 'molecular tumour boards' (MTBs). Attended by a heterogenous set of practitioners, MTBs link genomic platforms to clinical practices by establishing 'actionable' connections between drugs and molecular alterations. Their activities rely on a number of evidential resources - for example databases, clinical trial results, basic knowledge about mutations and pathways - that need to be associated with the clinical trajectory of individual patients. Experts from various domains are required to master and align diverse kinds of information. However, rather than examining MTBs as an institution interfacing different kinds of expertise embedded in individual experts, we argue that expertise is the emergent outcome of MTBs, which can be conceptualised as networks or 'agencements' of humans and devices. Based on the ethnographic analysis of the activities of four clinical trial MTBs (three in France and an international one) and of two French routine-care MTBs, the paper analyses how MTBs produce therapeutic decisions, centring on the new kind of expertise they engender. The development and activities of MTBs signal a profound transformation of the evidentiary basis and processes upon which biomedical expertise and decision-making in oncology are predicated and, in particular, the emergence of a clinic of variants. © 2019 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness.

AB PURPOSE: Although multimodal chemotherapy has improved outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma, the prognosis for patients who present with metastatic and/or recurrent disease remains poor. In this study, we sought to define how often clinical genomic sequencing of osteosarcoma samples could identify potentially actionable alterations.Experimental Design: We analyzed genomic data from 71 osteosarcoma samples from 66 pediatric and adult patients sequenced using MSK-IMPACT, a hybridization capture-based large panel next-generation sequencing assay. Potentially actionable genetic events were categorized according to the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge base, of which levels 1 to 3 were considered clinically actionable.; RESULTS: We found at least one potentially actionable alteration in 14 of 66 patients (21%), including amplification of CDK4 (n = 9, 14%: level 2B) and/or MDM2 (n = 9, 14%: level 3B), and somatic truncating mutations/deletions in BRCA2 (n = 3, 5%: level 2B) and PTCH1 (n = 1, level 3B). In addition, we observed mutually exclusive patterns of alterations suggesting distinct biological subsets defined by gains at 4q12 and 6p12-21. Specifically, potentially targetable gene amplifications at 4q12 involving KIT, KDR, and PDGFRA were identified in 13 of 66 patients (20%), which showed strong PDGFRA expression by IHC. In another largely nonoverlapping subset of 14 patients (24%) with gains at 6p12-21, VEGFA amplification was identified.; CONCLUSIONS: We found potentially clinically actionable alterations in approximately 21% of patients with osteosarcoma. In addition, at least 40% of patients have tumors harboring PDGFRA or VEGFA amplification, representing candidate subsets for clinical evaluation of additional therapeutic options. We propose a new genomically based algorithm for directing patients with osteosarcoma to clinical trial options. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Background: Monitoring and evaluation is vital in the quest to improve the quality of care and to reduce the morbidity and mortality of neonates in a resource-limited setting. Databases offer several advantages such as data on large cohorts of neonates and from multiple centres. Aim: To establish a minimal dataset neonatal database in Kigali, Rwanda and to assess the quality and timing of the data entry process. Secondary objectives were to describe survival rates and associated risk factors. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was undertaken at a tertiary hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. The Rwanda Neonatal Data Collection Form was designed specifically for the database, based on the Vermont-Oxford Network neonatal data-collection tool with locally relevant amendments. All admitted neonates were enrolled during the study period of 2011-2017 with ongoing data-collection. Infants were recruited and data collected prospectively and cross-checked retrospectively with the inclusion of basic data on neonates who were not initially recruited prospectively. Results: 3391 analysable cases were recruited: 1420 prospective and 1971 retrospective cases. Prospective data collection peaked at 90%. Data entry was not always complete with data-points left blank with only 21% having adequate data available (0-25% missing). All-cause mortality during the study period was 16% and annual mortality ranged from 12% to 24%. On multivariate analysis, place of birth (AOR 2.17), small-for-gestational-age (AOR 2.05) and gestational age were all positively associated with survival. Conclusions: An academic setting in a low- or middle-income country can create and maintain a neonatal database without funding and produce a wealth of actionable results. Throughout the process, there were considerable challenges which must be addressed if such a database is to be optimised, maintained and created in other clinical sites.

AB Inflammation drives the formation, evolution, and complication of atherosclerotic plaques. Yet, we have not yet captured the culprits who light the fire that burns within the atherosclerotic plaque. The arsonist remains at large. A rigorous analysis exculpates many of the usual suspects. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) itself engenders little inflammation. Clinical trials do not support an actionable role of oxidized LDL in atherothrombosis. In contrast, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins do promote inflammation, and provide a promising target for intervention. Obese adipose tissue -especially visceral or ectopic lipid deposits -also incite inflammation. A newly recognized cardiovascular risk factor, clonal hematopoiesis provides a novel link between inflammatory pathways and atherosclerotic risk. Despite this progress, the jury is still out on who lit the plaque afire. The rigorous observer must still consider this an unsolved act of arson. We remain in "hot" pursuit of the causal culprit, the arsonist, and accomplices who set the artery wall ablaze. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ETV6-ABL1 fusion is a rare genetic aberration classified as Philadelphia chromosome-like high-risk B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We present the case of a child with multiply relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in which next-generation sequencing identified this cryptic fusion, undetected by standard testing, resulting in sustained clinical response to targetted therapy with imatinib. Upon subsequent relapse, repeat next-generation sequencing identified an additional aberration, MLL2-ADCY9, as a possible molecular driver conferring resistance to therapy. This report demonstrates the exciting potential of integrative clinical sequencing in identifying previously undetected actionable findings leading to improved outcomes in pediatric oncology patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe drug prescribing and outcomes after pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in children with developmental and/or behavioral disorders.; METHODS: This is a single-clinic retrospective analysis of patients aged 5 to 17 years with documented behavioral and/or development disorder(s) and having received PGx testing between May 2015 and May 2017. The primary endpoint was frequency of PGx-guided medication changes after testing. Secondary endpoints included frequency of medications in each category from the PGx report (use as directed, use with caution, and use with increased caution), changes in therapy within each category, frequency and type of actionable genes, symptomatic improvement, and frequency of medication changes up to 6 months after PGx-guided therapy.; RESULTS: Of 200 patients, 75% were male, 78% were white, 83% had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and 45% had anxiety, and their mean age was 10 years. Most common reasons for ordering PGx testing were lack of response (83%) and/or adverse events (42%). Approximately 84% had PGx-guided medication change(s) after testing. At baseline, 50% of medications were categorized in "use as directed," 40% in "use with caution," and 11% in "use with increased caution." After testing, 8%, 29%, and 30% of medications in "use as directed," "use with caution," and "use with increased caution" categories were discontinued; 85% were added or continued from "use as directed" category. The most common actionable genes were ADRA2A (47%), COMT (22%), and CYP2D6 (20%). Sixty percent were on the same medication(s) suggested by the PGx report 6 months later, and 64% had provider-documented symptomatic improvement.; CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenomic testing may affect drug prescribing and clinical outcomes in a pediatric behavioral health clinic.

AB PURPOSE: Circumscribed gliomas -pilocytic astrocytomas (PA), gangliogliomas (GG), ependymomas (EP)- are mostly low-grade tumours but may progress to anaplasia and sometimes surgery can be challenging due to deep anatomical localization. Because of the high frequency of MAPK-pathway alterations and availability of targeted therapies for FGFR1 and BRAF-mutated tumors, we investigated these mutational hotspots in a cohort of adult circumscribed gliomas.; METHODS: Adult patients (>15years) with diagnosis of PA, GG, EP and DNET were retrospectively identified from two institutions databases. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded or frozen samples and exons including codons 546 and 656 of FGFR1 and V600 of BRAF were sequenced.; RESULTS: FGFR1 mutations were identified in 15/108 PA and were particularly frequent in optic pathway (6/9 vs. 9/108; p=10-4). FGFR1 was mutated in 3/75 grade II versus 2/7 grade III GG (p=0.05), 1/7 DNET, 1/100 EP grade II. We found 3/108 PA with BRAF pVal600Glu and 6/108 with p.Thr599_Val600insThr. The p.Val600Glu was found in 14/75 grade II GG. No EP were BRAF mutated.; CONCLUSIONS: We report actionable targets, including frequent FGFR1 mutation in optic-pathway PA that makes them excellent candidates to anti-FGFR therapies, and BRAF non-canonical mutations in PA.

AB Adopting a systems approach, we devise a general workflow to define actionable subtypes in human cancers. Applied to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the workflow identifies four subtypes based on global gene expression patterns and ontologies. Three correspond to known subtypes (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, and SCLC-Y), while the fourth is a previously undescribed ASCL1+ neuroendocrine variant (NEv2, or SCLC-A2). Tumor deconvolution with subtype gene signatures shows that all of the subtypes are detectable in varying proportions in human and mouse tumors. To understand how multiple stable subtypes can arise within a tumor, we infer a network of transcription factors and develop BooleaBayes, a minimally-constrained Boolean rule-fitting approach. In silico perturbations of the network identify master regulators and destabilizers of its attractors. Specific to NEv2, BooleaBayes predicts ELF3 and NR0B1 as master regulators of the subtype, and TCF3 as a master destabilizer. Since the four subtypes exhibit differential drug sensitivity, with NEv2 consistently least sensitive, these findings may lead to actionable therapeutic strategies that consider SCLC intratumoral heterogeneity. Our systems-level approach should generalize to other cancer types.

AB One of the first achievements of molecular biology in lymphoma science was a discovery of cell of origin (COO) classification around 20 years ago with defining activated B-cell like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell like subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with the use of gene expression profiling. These categories were considered important as seemed to present different biology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Immunochemotherapy R-CHOP21 has been a standard of care for 2 decades, and it results in long-term disease-free survival or cure of 60% of patients with DLBCL but efficacy in an individual patient depends on age and other International Prognostic Index clinical risk factors and is within a range of 30% to more than 90%. Clinical attempts to enhance activity of immunochemotherapy in high-risk DLBCL like ABC or others included adding targeted agents to the R-CHOP backbone: bortezomib, lenalidomide, ibrutinib. Unfortunately, randomized clinical trials did not confirm the expected benefit. Recently, advanced molecular techniques were used to classify B-cell lymphomas beyond COO or MYC alterations and correlated with clinical outcome as illustrated by 2 recently published influential studies from the National Institutes of Health and from Dana Farber Cancer Center, USA. Advanced molecular pathogenesis descriptions of DLBCL provide a framework for actionable classifications that should be used for designing future clinical trials and hopefully bring success to treatment of high-risk aggressive lymphoma. © American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

AB We implemented a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods evaluation of an air pollution data report-back to study participants in Chelsea, Massachusetts. We aimed to determine whether the report-back was effective in the following three ways: engagement, understandability, and actionability for the participants. We also evaluated participants' valuation of the report-back information and process. The evaluation involved both qualitative components, such as ethnographic observation, and quantitative components, such as closed-ended questionnaires and demographic data. The participants who engaged in the report-back process were significantly different from those who did not engage both in terms of their demographics, and in their indoor air pollutant concentrations. Participant understanding generally corresponded with the intended meaning of the research team, suggesting successful data communication. Additionally, many of the participants reported that they were inspired to take action in order to reduce their indoor air pollutant exposure as a result of the report-back process and information provided. These results identify areas of improvement for engagement, particularly regarding populations that may have higher exposures. This work outlines a framework with which to contextualize and evaluate the success of engagement with report-back efforts. Such evaluations can allow research teams to assess whether they are providing information that is equitably useful and actionable for all participants.

AB We use a computational modelling approach to explore whether it is possible to infer a solid tumour's cellular proliferative hierarchy under the assumptions of the cancer stem cell hypothesis and neutral evolution. We focus on inferring the symmetric division probability for cancer stem cells, since this is believed to be a key driver of progression and therapeutic response. Motivated by the advent of multi-region sampling and resulting opportunities to infer tumour evolutionary history, we focus on a suite of statistical measures of the phylogenetic trees resulting from the tumour's evolution in different regions of parameter space and through time. We find strikingly different patterns in these measures for changing symmetric division probability which hinge on the inclusion of spatial constraints. These results give us a starting point to begin stratifying tumours by this biological parameter and also generate a number of actionable clinical and biological hypotheses including changes during therapy, and through tumour evolution. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Although cancer mortality rates declined in the United States in recent decades, some populations experienced little benefit from advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship care. In fact, some cancer disparities between populations of low and high socioeconomic status widened during this period. Many potentially preventable cancer deaths continue to occur, and disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden. Reducing the burden of cancer and eliminating cancer-related disparities will require more focused and coordinated action across multiple sectors and in partnership with communities. This article, part of the American Cancer Society's Cancer Control Blueprint series, introduces a framework for understanding and addressing social determinants to advance cancer health equity and presents actionable recommendations for practice, research, and policy. The article aims to accelerate progress toward eliminating disparities in cancer and achieving health equity. © 2019 American Cancer Society.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) often struggle with blood pressure control. In team-based models of care, pharmacists and primary care providers (PCPs) play important roles in supporting patients' blood pressure management.; OBJECTIVE: To describe whether PCPs' acceptance of pharmacists' recommendations impacts systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 36 months.; DESIGN: An observational analysis of a subset of participants randomized to the intervention arm of the Simultaneous risk factor control using Telehealth to slOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease (STOP-DKD) study.; PARTICIPANTS: STOP-DKD participants for whom (1) the pharmacist made at least one recommendation to the PCP; (2) there were available data regarding the PCP's corresponding action; and (3) there were SBP measurements at baseline and 36 months.; INTERVENTION: Participants received monthly telephone calls with a pharmacist addressing health behaviors and medication management. Pharmacists made medication-related recommendations to PCPs.; MAIN MEASURES: We fit an unadjusted generalized linear mixed model to assess the association between the number of pharmacists' recommendations for DKD and blood pressure management and PCPs' acceptance of such recommendations. We used a linear regression model to evaluate the association between PCP acceptance and SBP at 36 months, adjusted for baseline SBP.; KEY RESULTS: Pharmacists made 176 treatment recommendations (among 59 participants), of which 107 (61%) were accepted by PCPs. SBP significantly declined by an average of 10.5 mmHg (p < 0.01) among 47 of 59 participants who had valid measurements at baseline and 36 months. There was a significant association between the number of pharmacist recommendations and the odds of PCP acceptance (OR 1.19; 95%CI 1.00, 1.42; p < 0.05), but no association between the number of accepted recommendations and SBP.; CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists provided actionable medication-related recommendations. We identified a significant decline in SBP at 36 months, but this reduction was not associated with recommendation acceptance.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01829256.

AB Genomic testing of adolescents is increasing yet engaging them in decision making is not routine. We assessed decisional conflict in adolescents and a parent making independent decisions about actual genomic testing results and factors that influenced their choices. We enrolled 163 dyads consisting of an adolescent (13-17years) not selected based on a specific clinical indication and one parent. After independently choosing categories of conditions to learn for the adolescent, participants completed the validated Decisional Conflict Scale and a survey assessing factors influencing their respective choices. Adolescents had higher decisional conflict scores than parents (15.6 (IQR:4.7-25.6) vs 9.4 (IQR:1.6-21.9); P=0.0007). Adolescents with clinically significant decisional conflict were less likely to choose to learn all results than adolescents with lower decisional conflict (19.6% vs 80.4%; P<0.0001) and less likely to report their choices were influenced by actionability of results (33.3% vs 18.9%; P=0.044) and feeling confident they can deal with the results (71.2% vs 91.9%; P=0.0005). Our findings suggest higher decisional conflict in adolescents may influence the type and amount of genomic results they wish to learn. Additional research assessing decisional conflict and factors influencing testing choices among adolescents in clinical settings are required. This article is protected by copyright.

AB Prior cytogenetic profiling of osteosarcomas has suggested that amplifications at the 6p12-21 locus are relatively common alterations in these tumors. However, these studies have been limited by variable testing methodologies used as well as by the relatively small numbers of cases that have been analyzed. To better define the frequency of this alteration, 111 osteosarcomas were profiled using hybridization capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) platform (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets, MSK-IMPACT) as part of an institutional clinical cancer genomics initiative. Using this platform, amplification at the 6p12-21 locus was determined by copy number assessment of the VEGFA and CCND3 genes. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to assess copy number status for RUNX2, a known transcriptional regulator of osteoblastic differentiation which has previously been reported to be dysregulated in osteosarcomas. 6p12-21 amplification using NGS-based copy number assessment was confirmed in over a fifth of all cases tested (24 of 111, 21.6%). Most of these cases, when tested using FISH, were found to include RUNX2 within the amplified locus (17 of 18, 94.4%). While many laboratories lack access to large-panel NGS assays, the use of FISH to identify 6p12-21 amplification events by targeting RUNX2 represents a widely available diagnostic modality for the identification of such cases. This could help better define the role of RUNX2 in osteoblastic differentiation and serve as a surrogate for the identification of potentially targetable alterations such as VEGFA amplification at this locus.

AB Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most biologically aggressive and very often lethal breast disease. It is one of the most puzzling women malignancies, and it currently appears not to be a good candidate to a standardized, unanimously accepted and sufficiently active therapeutic strategy. Fast proliferating and poorly differentiated, it is histopathologically heterogeneous, and even more ambiguous at the molecular level, offering few recurrent actionable targets to the clinicians. It is a formidable and vicious enemy that requires a huge investigational effort to find its vital weak spots. Here, we provide a broad review of "old but gold" biological aspects that taken together may help in finding new TNBC management strategies. A better and updated knowledge of the origins, war-like tactics, refueling mechanisms and escape routes of TNBC, will help in moving the decisive steps towards its final defeat. Copyright © 2019.

AB This review presents a survey of, and guide to, New Materials Physics research. It begins with an overview of the goals of New Materials Physics and then presents important ideas and techniques for the design and growth of new materials. An emphasis is placed on the use of compositional phase diagrams to inform and motivate solution growth of single crystals. The second half of this review focuses on the vital process of generating actionable ideas for the growth and discovery of new materials and ground states. Motivations ranging from (1) wanting a specific compound, to (2) wanting a specific ground state to (3) wanting to explore for known and unknown unknowns, will be discussed and illustrated with abundant examples. The goal of this review is to inform, inspire, an even entertain, as many practitioners of this field as possible. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is becoming much more genetically complex than was initially considered. Thus, the role of HAE genetics is expanding beyond research laboratories, and the genotyping of subjects suffering from HAE has become diagnostically indispensable in clinical practice. The synthesis and interpretation of the clinical and biochemical analyses to facilitate appropriate genetic test selection has thus also become significantly more complex. With this in mind, an international multidisciplinary group of 14 experts in HAE genetics and disease management was convened in October 2018. The objective was to develop clear, actionable, evidence- and consensus-based statements aiming to facilitate the communication between physicians treating patients with HAE and clinical geneticists, and thus promote the effective use of genetics in the management of the disease. Eleven consensus statements were generated, encompassing considerations regarding the clinical indications for genotyping patients with angioedema, the methods of detection of HAE-causative variants, the variant pathogenicity curation, the genotyping of patients with HAE in the clinic, and genetic counseling. These statements are intended both to guide clinicians and to serve as a framework for future educational and further genetic testing developments as the field continues to evolve rapidly.

AB IMPORTANCE: Death due to preventable medical error is a leading cause of death, with varying estimates of preventable death rates (14%-56% of total deaths based on national extrapolated estimates, 3%-11% based on single-centre estimates). Yet, how best to reduce preventable mortality in hospitals remains unknown.; OBJECTIVE: In this article, we detail lessons learnt from implementing a hospital-wide, automated, real-time, electronic mortality reporting system that relies on the opinions of front-line clinicians to identify opportunities for improvement. We also summarise data obtained regarding possible preventability, systems issues identified and addressed, and challenges with implementation. We outline our process of survey, evaluation, escalation and tracking of opportunities identified through the review process.; METHODS: We aggregated and analysed 7years of review data regarding deaths, review responses categorised by ratings of possible preventability and inter-rater reliability of possible preventability. A qualitative analysis of reviews was performed to identify care delivery opportunities and institutional response.; RESULTS: Over the course of 7years, 7856 inpatient deaths occurred, and 91% had at least one review completed. 5.2% were rated by front-line clinicians as potentially being preventable (likely or possibly), and this rate was consistent over time. However, there was only slight inter-rater agreement regarding potential preventability (Cohen's kappa=0.185). Nevertheless, several major systems-level opportunities were identified that facilitated care delivery improvements, such as communication challenges, need for improved end-of-life care and interhospital transfer safety.; CONCLUSIONS: Through implementation, we found that a hospital-wide mortality review process that elicits feedback from front-line providers is feasible, and provides valuable insights regarding potential preventable mortality and prioritising actionable opportunities for care delivery improvements. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB We developed a code and data-driven system (learning healthcare system) for gleaning actionable clinical insight from interventional radiology (IR) data. To this end, we constructed a workflow for the collection, processing and analysis of electronic health record (EHR), imaging, and cancer registry data for a cohort of interventional radiology patients seen in the IR Clinic at our institution over a more than 20-year period. As part of this pipeline, we created a database in REDCap (VITAL) to store raw data, as collected by a team of clinical investigators and the Data Coordinating Center at our university. We developed a single, universal pre-processing codebank for our VITAL data in R; in addition, we also wrote widely extendable and easily modifiable analysis code in R that presents results from summary statistics, statistical tests, visualizations, Kaplan-Meier analyses, and Cox proportional hazard modeling, among other analysis techniques. We present our findings for a test case of supra versus infra-inguinal ligament stenting. The developed pre-processing and analysis pipelines were memory and speed-efficient, with both pipelines running in less than 2min. Three different supra-inguinal ligament veins had a statistically significant improvement in vein diameters post-stenting versus pre-stenting, while no infra-inguinal ligament veins had a statistically significant improvement (due either to an insufficient sample size or a non-significant p value). However, infra-inguinal ligament stenting was not associated with worse restenosis or patency outcomes in either a univariate (summary-statistics and Kaplan-Meier based) or multivariate (Cox proportional hazard model based) analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: The impact of activating alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutation/anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] translocation) in prognosticating patients with brain metastasis (BM) is not well defined. This study was sought to identify this impact in NSCLC patients with BM accounting for the known validated variables.; METHODS: Among 1078 NSCLC-BM patients diagnosed/treated between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015, three hundred and forty-eight with known EGFR/ALK status were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) were measured from the time of BM.; RESULTS: Ninety-one patients had either ALK (n = 23) alterations or EGFR (n = 68) mutation and 257 were wild type (WT; negative actionable mutations/alterations). Median age of EGFR/ALK+ NSCLC BM patients was 60 years (range 29.8-82.6 y) and ~50% (n = 44) had Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score >80. Median number of BM was 2 (1 to ≥99). The median OS for the ALK/EGFR+ NSCLC BM was 19.9 versus 10.1 months for the WT (P = 0.028). The number of BM in the EGFR/ALK+ group did not impact OS (BM = 1 with 21.1 months vs 2-3 with 19.1 months and >3 with 23.7 months, P = 0.74), whereas fewer BM in the WT cohort had significantly better OS (BM = 1 with 13.8 mo, 2-3 with 11.0 mo and >3 with 8.1 mo; P = 0.006) with the adjustment of age, KPS, symptoms from BM and synchronicity.; CONCLUSIONS: Number of BM does not impact outcomes in the EGFR/ALK+ NSCLC patients, implying that targeted therapy along with surgery and/or radiation may improve OS irrespective of the number of BM. Number of BM, extracranial metastasis (ECM), and KPS independently affected OS/PFS in WT NSCLC BM, which was consistent with the known literature. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Policy Points Political advertising can influence which issues are public policy priorities. Population health-relevant issues were frequently referenced in televised political advertising in the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 US election cycles, with about one-fourth of all ads aired mentioning traditional public health and health policy topics and more than half referencing broader determinants of population health. The volume of population health-relevant issues referenced in political ads varied by geography, political office, political party, and election cycle. Ads referencing broader determinants of population health (such as employment, education, or gender equality) rarely tied these determinants directly to health outcomes.; CONTEXT: Political discourse is one way that policymakers and candidates for public office discuss societal problems, propose solutions, and articulate actionable policies that might improve population health. Yet we know little about how politicians define and discuss issues relevant to population health in their major source of electoral communication, campaign advertisements. This study examined the prevalence of references to population health-relevant issues conveyed in campaign advertising for political office at all levels of government in the United States in 2011-2012 and 2015-2016. Understanding advertising as part of the political discourse on topics of relevance to population health yields insights about political agenda-setting and can inform efforts to shape opinion.; METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all English-language, candidate-related campaign advertisements aired on local broadcast, national network, and national cable television in the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 election cycles (3,980,457 and 3,767,477 airings, respectively). We analyzed the volume of coverage in these ads about issues relevant to population health, including narrowly defined public health issues as well as a broad range of other social, economic, and environmental factors that affect population health.; FINDINGS: Across both election cycles and all electoral races, 26% of campaign advertising discussed issues relevant for the narrowly defined conceptualization of public health and 57% discussed issues pertinent to topics within the more expansive population health conceptualization. There was substantial variation in population health-related content in ads across election cycles, by level of political office, political party, and geographic area. Geographic variation indicates that where a person lives affects their potential exposure to political communication about various health-related topics.; CONCLUSIONS: Political campaign ads in the United States frequently referenced population health-relevant content at all levels of government, although the ads rarely connected population health-relevant issues to health. Variation in volume and content of these references likely shaped public opinion and the public will to address population health-related policy. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Introduction: The development of precision medicine and targeted therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment. Historically, treatment was chosen based on the tumor-histology, but can now be tailored to patient-specific biomarkers. Investigations have shown up to 40% of cancer patients who undergo molecular testing have an actionable biomarker with a drug currently available, and that patients benefit from these drugs. In 2018, larotrectinib became the first drug developed and approved exclusively as a tumor-agnostic therapy. Because of advancement in precision medicine, biomarker testing has become a standard of care in a variety of tumors and its use is increasing. Areas covered: We discuss the landscape of biomarker testing in the context of soft tissue sarcomas and thyroid cancer, two rare diseases with historically high unmet needs in their subpopulations. We summarize historical data and contemporary applications. Expert opinion: The paradigm shift in oncology treatment toward precision medicine, including tumor-agnostic agents, is experiencing substantial momentum but still facing challenges. A gap exists between guideline recommendations for biomarker testing and clinical application, resulting in compromised access and suboptimal outcomes. Future progress will require routine access to testing and expanding treatment options coupled with awareness, predictability, and strategies to address resistance mechanisms.

AB Metastatic cancer is a major cause of death and is associated with poor treatment efficacy. A better understanding of the characteristics of late-stage cancer is required to help adapt personalized treatments, reduce overtreatment and improve outcomes. Here we describe the largest, to our knowledge, pan-cancer study of metastatic solid tumour genomes, including whole-genome sequencing data for 2,520 pairs of tumour and normal tissue, analysed at median depths of 106* and 38*, respectively, and surveying more than 70million somatic variants. The characteristic mutations of metastatic lesions varied widely, with mutations that reflect those of the primary tumour types, and with high rates of whole-genome duplication events (56%). Individual metastatic lesions were relatively homogeneous, with the vast majority (96%) of driver mutations being clonal and up to 80% of tumour-suppressor genes being inactivated bi-allelically by different mutational mechanisms. Although metastatic tumour genomes showed similar mutational landscape and driver genes to primary tumours, we find characteristics that could contribute to responsiveness to therapy or resistance in individual patients. We implement an approach for the review of clinically relevant associations and their potential for actionability. For 62% of patients, we identify genetic variants that may be used to stratify patients towards therapies that either have been approved or are in clinical trials. This demonstrates the importance of comprehensive genomic tumour profiling for precision medicine in cancer.

AB The metabolome is a system of small biomolecules (metabolites) and a direct result of human bioculture. Consequently, metabolomics is well poised to impact anthropological and biomedical research for the foreseeable future. Overall, we provide a perspective on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of metabolomics, which we argue are often more alarming than those of genomics. Given the current mechanisms to fund research, ELSI beyond human DNA is stifled and in need of considerable attention. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Importance: Emerging efforts to recognize and combat medical overuse are important solutions to mitigate patient morbidity from unnecessary health care interventions.; Objectives: To identify and highlight important original investigations on medical overuse in dermatology from 2017 to 2018.; Evidence Review: The PubMed and Embase databases coupled with articles published in 8 major dermatology and medical journals from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, were searched to identify articles related to medical overuse in dermatology.; Findings: Of 1941 candidate articles identified through the database search and 41 through the manual journal review, 38 were deemed relevant to medical overuse in dermatology by 2 independent reviewers. Twenty-eight of these articles were determined to be high priority based on scoring for quality of methods, magnitude of clinical effect, and number of patients potentially affected. After expert reviewer scoring, 10 articles were selected for analysis based on highest scores and greatest clinical significance. Selected articles covered topics such as dermatology consultation for cellulitis, management of dysplastic nevi, prognostic utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy, laboratory monitoring for terbinafine and isotretinoin, and safe medication prescribing. For cellulitis management, dermatology consultation is important for reducing misdiagnosis, unnecessary hospitalization, and inappropriate use of antibiotics. Findings related to common dermatologic procedures revealed that clinical observation is safe for dysplastic nevi and that sentinel lymph node biopsy may not have prognostic utility over Breslow thickness. In monitoring for terbinafine and isotretinoin, patient education on clinical symptoms is likely more effective than standard laboratory test result monitoring. Finally, dermatologists should reconsider the use of cyclosporine in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis and reevaluate the use of perioperative narcotics for patients.; Conclusions and Relevance: This review notes actionable, evidence-based practices to reduce medical overuse in dermatology. This work may help to facilitate management changes to emphasize high-value care in dermatology while promoting awareness and further evaluation of overuse in medicine.

AB Phosphomannomutase 2 deficiency, or PMM2-CDG, is the most common congenital disorder of glycosylation affecting over 1,000 patients globally. There are no approved drugs that treat the symptoms or root cause of PMM2-CDG. In order to identify clinically actionable compounds that boost human PMM2 enzyme function, we performed a multi-species drug repurposing screen using a first-ever worm model of PMM2-CDG followed by PMM2 enzyme functional studies in PMM2-CDG patient fibroblasts. Drug repurposing candidates from this study, and drug repurposing candidates from a previously published study using yeast models of PMM2-CDG, were tested for their effect on human PMM2 enzyme activity in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts. Of the 20 repurposing candidates discovered in the worm-based phenotypic screen, 12 are plant-based polyphenols. Insights from structure-activity relationships revealed epalrestat, the only antidiabetic aldose reductase inhibitor approved for use in humans, as a first-in-class PMM2 enzyme activator. Epalrestat increased PMM2 enzymatic activity in four PMM2-CDG patient fibroblast lines with genotypes R141H/F119L, R141H/E139K, R141H/N216I and R141H/F183S. PMM2 enzyme activity gains range from 30% to 400% over baseline depending on genotype. Pharmacological inhibition of aldose reductase by epalrestat may shunt glucose from the polyol pathway to glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, which is an endogenous stabilizer and coactivator of PMM2 homodimerization. Epalrestat is a safe, oral and brain penetrant drug that was approved 27 years ago in Japan to treat diabetic neuropathy in geriatric populations. We demonstrate that epalrestat is the first small molecule activator of PMM2 enzyme activity with the potential to treat peripheral neuropathy and correct the underlying enzyme deficiency in a majority of pediatric and adult PMM2-CDG patients. © 2019.

AB OBJECTIVE: Youth who have a parent with recurrent depression are at high risk for mental health problems. There is a need to identify transdiagnostic and clinically actionable mechanisms that explain higher rates of psychopathology among high-risk youth. The present study sought to examine whether offspring of depressed parents exhibit greater parent- and self-reported sleep disturbance, shorter sleep duration, and later sleep midpoint compared to youth without any parental psychopathology.; METHOD: Participants included 82 youth, including 41 youth (ages 9-13; mean age = 11.07years; 46% female) deemed to be at high-risk based on having a parent with a recurrent depression history, and 41 (mean age = 11.16years; 49% female) at low-risk based on having parents without any history of psychopathology. Youth and their parents completed measures of youth sleep disturbance, and youth completed measures of sleep duration and midpoint using a daily sleep diary for 9days.; RESULTS: Offspring of parents with depression exhibited more sleep disturbance (e.g., problematic nighttime behaviors and daytime sleepiness) than low-risk youth as reported by both parents and youth. For parent-reported sleep disturbance, there were also sex differences. High-risk girls had more sleep disturbance than high-risk boys or low-risk girls. There were no group differences for daily sleep duration and midpoint.; CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbance may be an important area for assessment among offspring of parents with depression. Our findings highlight one potential transdiagnostic risk factor that may emerge among high-risk youth, and sex-specific differences in sleep disturbance, which have implications for prevention and intervention. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Phenology - the timing of cyclical and seasonal natural phenomena such as flowering and leaf out - is an integral part of ecological systems with impacts on human activities like environmental management, tourism, and agriculture. As a result, there are numerous potential applications for actionable predictions of when phenological events will occur. However, despite the availability of phenological data with large spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents, and numerous phenology models, there has been no automated species-level forecasts of plant phenology. This is due in part to the challenges of building a system that integrates large volumes of climate observations and forecasts, uses that data to fit models and make predictions for large numbers of species, and consistently disseminates the results of these forecasts in interpretable ways. Here we describe a new near-term phenology forecasting system that makes predictions for the timing of budburst, flowers, ripe fruit, and fall colors for 78 species across the United States up to 6 months in advance and is updated every four days. We use the lessons learned in developing this system to provide guidance developing large-scale near-term ecological forecast systems more generally, to help advance the use of automated forecasting in ecology. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to report the efficacy of topical and systemic treatments for immune-related cutaneous adverse events (ircAEs) attributed to checkpoint inhibitors in an uncontrolled cohort of patients referred to oncodermatology clinics.; METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with ircAEs evaluated by dermatologists from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017, at three tertiary care hospitals and cancer centers were identified through electronic medical records. Clinicopathologic characteristics, dermatologic therapy outcome, and laboratory data were analyzed.; RESULTS: A total of 285 patients (median age, 65 years [range, 17 to 89 years]) with 427 ircAEs were included: pruritus (n = 138; 32%), maculopapular rash (n = 120; 28%), psoriasiform rash (n = 22; 5%), and others (n = 147; 34%). Immune checkpoint inhibitor class was associated with ircAE phenotype (P = .007), where maculopapular rash was predominant in patients who received combination therapy. Severity of ircAEs was significantly reduced (mean Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade: 1.74 v 0.71; P < .001) with dermatologic interventions, including topical corticosteroids, oral antipruritics, and systemic immunomodulators. A total of 88 ircAEs (20%) were managed with systemic immunomodulators. Of these, 22 (25%) of 88 persisted or worsened. In seven patients with corticosteroid-refractory ircAEs, improvement resulted from targeted biologic immunomodulatory therapies that included rituximab and dupilumab. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was elevated in 34 (52%) of 65 patients; grade 3 or greater ircAEs were associated with increased absolute eosinophils (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 13.4) and IL-10 (odds ratio, 23.8; 95% CI, 2.1 to 262.5); mean immunoglobulin E serum levels were greater in higher-grade ircAEs: 1,093 kU/L (grade 3), 245 kU/L (grade 2), and 112 kU/L (grade 1; P = .043).; CONCLUSION: Most ircAEs responded to symptom- and phenotype-directed dermatologic therapies, whereas biologic therapies were effective in patients with corticosteroid-refractory disease. Increased eosinophils, IL-6, IL-10, and immunoglobulin E were associated with ircAEs, and they may represent actionable therapeutic targets for immune-related skin toxicities.

AB Social epidemiology has made critical contributions to understanding population health. However, translation of social epidemiology science into action remains a challenge, raising concerns about the impacts of the field beyond academia. With so much focus on issues related to social position, discrimination, racism, power, and privilege, there has been surprisingly little deliberation about the extent and value of social inclusion and equity within the field itself. Indeed, the challenge of translation/action might be more readily met through re-envisioning the role of the people within the research/practice enterprise-reimagining what "social" could, or even should, mean for the future of the field. A potential path forward rests at the nexus of social epidemiology, community-based participatory research (CBPR), and information and communication technology (ICT). Here, we draw from social epidemiology, CBPR, and ICT literatures to introduce A People's Social Epi-a multi-tiered framework for guiding social epidemiology in becoming more inclusive, equitable, and actionable for 21st century practice. In presenting this framework, we suggest the value of taking participatory, collaborative approaches anchored in CBPR and ICT principles and technological affordances-especially within the context of place-based and environmental research. We believe that such approaches present opportunities to create a social epidemiology that is of, with, and by the people-not simply about them. In this spirit, we suggest 10 ICT tools to "socialize" social epidemiology and outline 10 ways to move towards A People's Social Epi in practice.

AB The development of more effective rehabilitative interventions requires a better understanding of how humans learn and transfer motor skills in real-world contexts. Presently, clinicians design interventions to promote skill learning by relying on evidence from experimental paradigms involving simple tasks, such as reaching for a target. While these tasks facilitate stringent hypothesis testing in laboratory settings, the results may not shed light on performance of more complex real-world skills. In this perspective, we argue that virtual environments (VEs) are flexible, novel platforms to evaluate learning and transfer of complex skills without sacrificing experimental control. Specifically, VEs use models of real-life tasks that afford controlled experimental manipulations to measure and guide behavior with a precision that exceeds the capabilities of physical environments. This paper reviews recent insights from VE paradigms on motor learning into two pressing challenges in rehabilitation research: 1) Which training strategies in VEs promote complex skill learning? and 2) How can transfer of learning from virtual to real environments be enhanced? Defining complex skills by having nested redundancies, we outline findings on the role of movement variability in complex skill acquisition and discuss how VEs can provide novel forms of guidance to enhance learning. We review the evidence for skill transfer from virtual to real environments in typically developing and neurologically-impaired populationswith a view to understanding how differences in sensory-motor information may influence learning strategies. We provide actionable suggestions for practicing clinicians and outline broad areas where more research is required. Finally, we conclude that VEs present distinctive experimental platforms to understand complex skill learning that should enable transfer from therapeutic practice to the real world.

AB The domain of healthcare has always been flooded with a huge amount of complex data, coming in at a very fast-pace. A vast amount of data is generated in different sectors of healthcare industry: data from hospitals and healthcare providers, medical insurance, medical equipment, life sciences and medical research. With the advancement in technology, there is a huge potential for utilization of this data for transforming healthcare. The application of analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence over big data enables identification of patterns and correlations and hence provides actionable insights for improving the delivery of healthcare. There have been many contributions to the literature in this topic, but we lack a comprehensive view of the current state of research and application. This paper focuses on assessing the available literature in order to provide the researchers with evidence that enable fostering further development in this area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research on big data analytics and artificial intelligence in healthcare, in which 2421 articles between 2013 and February 2019 were evaluated. The results of this study will help understand the needs in application of these technologies in healthcare by identifying the areas that require additional research. It will hence provide the researchers and industry experts with a base for future work. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) is a rare mesenchymal malignancy producing osteoid and bone in soft tissue without skeletal attachment. ESOS exhibits chemoresistance and poor prognosis, and is distinct from osseous osteosarcoma. The biological characteristics of ESOS are not fully understood, and patient-derived cell lines of ESOS are not available from public cell banks. Here, we established a novel cell line of ESOS and characterized its genetic and biological characteristics as well as examined its response to anti-cancer reagents. The cell line was established using tumor tissue from a 58-year-old female patient with ESOS, and named as NCC-ESOS1-C1. Phenotypes relevant to malignancy such as proliferation and invasion were examined in vitro, and genetic features were evaluated using the NCC Oncopanel assay. The response to inhibitors was monitored by screening of an anti-cancer reagent library. The cells constantly proliferated, showing spheroid formation and invasion capabilities. The NCC Oncopanel revealed the presence of actionable mutations in PIK3CA. Library screening revealed the presence of anti-cancer reagents with significant anti-proliferative effects on NCC-ESOS1-C1 at a low concentration. In conclusion, we established and characterized a novel ESOS cell line, NCC-ESOS1-C1. This cell line will be a useful resource for basic research and preclinical studies.

AB Introduction: The use of liquid biopsy on the blood from solid malignancies provides a convenient way of detecting actionable mutations, monitoring treatment response, detecting early recurrence and prognosticating outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss the current status and future direction of serum biomarkers in the clinical management of urinary bladder cancer. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of blood liquid biopsy and bladder cancer using methods of circulating tumors cells, circulating RNA, serum metabolites and cell-free DNA. Recent clinical studies and advances in methodology are emphasized. We performed a literature search using PMC/PubMed with keywords including 'liquid biopsy', 'circulating tumor DNA', 'cell-free DNA', 'biomarkers', 'bladder cancer' 'precision medicine'. Additional articles were obtained from the cited references of key articles. An emphasis was placed on recent studies published since 2018. Expert opinion: Liquid biopsies represent a potential biomarker using cell-free DNA, metabolomic profiles of altered cellular metabolism, circulating cancer cells and RNA. Despite displaying tremendous clinical promise, the current status of the blood liquid biopsies has not reached fruition. However, future investigations should lead the evolution of liquid biomarker into clinical utility for the management of bladder cancer.

AB Gene expression signature-based inference of functional connectivity within and between genetic perturbations, chemical perturbations, and disease status can lead to the development of actionable hypotheses for gene function, chemical modes of action, and disease treatment strategies. Here, we report a FuSiOn-based genome-wide integration of hypomorphic cellular phenotypes that enables functional annotation of gene network topology, assignment of mechanistic hypotheses to genes of unknown function, and detection of cooperativity among cell regulatory systems. Dovetailing genetic perturbation data with chemical perturbation phenotypes allowed simultaneous generation of mechanism of action hypotheses for thousands of uncharacterized natural products fractions (NPFs). The predicted mechanism of actions span a broad spectrum of cellular mechanisms, many of which are not currently recognized as "druggable." To enable use of FuSiOn as a hypothesis generation resource, all associations and analyses are available within an open source web-based GUI (http://fusion.yuhs.ac). Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: The underrepresentation of women in senior leadership positions of academic medicine continues to prevail despite the ongoing efforts to advance gender parity. Our aim was to compare the extent of gender imbalance in the leadership of the top 100 medical schools and to critically analyze the contributing factors through a comprehensive theoretical framework.; METHODS: We adopted the theoretical framework of the Systems and Career Influences Model. The leadership was classified into four tiers of leadership hierarchy. Variables of interest included gender, h-index, number of documents published, total number of citations, and number of years in active research. A total of 2448 (77.59%) men and 707 (22.41%) women met the inclusion criteria.; RESULTS: Male majority was found in all regions with a significant difference in all levels of leadership (chi square = 91.66; P value = .001). Women had a lower mean h-index across all positions in all regions, and when we adjusted for number of years invested, M Index for women was still significantly lower than men (T test = 6.52; P value = .02).; DISCUSSION: Organizational and individual influences are transcontinental within the top 100 medical school leadership hierarchy. Those factors were critically assessed through in-depth analysis of the Systems and Career Influences Model. Evidence-driven actionable recommendations to remedy those influences were outlined.

AB Owing to its advantages over prior relevant technologies, massive parallel or next-generation sequencing (NGS) is rapidly evolving, with growing applications in a wide range of human diseases. The burst in actionable molecular alterations in many cancer types advocates for the practicality of using NGS in the clinical setting, as it permits the parallel characterization of multiple genes in a cost- and time-effective way, starting from low-input DNA. In advanced clinical practice, the oncological management of colorectal cancer requires prior knowledge of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF status, for the design of appropriate therapeutic strategies, with more gene mutations still surfacing as potential biomarkers. Tumor heterogeneity, as well as the need for serial gene profiling due to tumor evolution and the emergence of novel genetic alterations, have promoted the use of liquid biopsies-especially in the form of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-as a promising alternative to tissue molecular analysis. This review discusses recent studies that have used plasma NGS in advanced colorectal cancer and summarizes the clinical applications, as well as the technical challenges involved in adopting this technique in a clinically beneficial oncological practice.

AB Biobank operations started officially in Finland in 2013 when the Biobank Act defining and regulating biobank operations came into force. Since then, ten biobanks have been established and they have started to collect new prospective samples with broad consent. The main corpus of biobank samples, however, consists of approximately 10 million "legacy samples". These are old diagnostic or research samples that were transferred to biobanks in accordance with the Biobank Act. The focus of this article is on ambiguities concerning these legacy samples and their transfer in terms of legality, human rights, autonomy, and social sustainability. We analyse the Finnish biobank operations in the context of international regulation, such as the European Convention of Human Rights, the Oviedo Convention, European Charter of Fundamental Rights, the GDPR, and EU Clinical Trials Regulation, and show that the practice of using legacy samples is at times problematic in relation to this regulatory framework. We argue that the prevailing interpretations of these regulations as translated into the Finnish biobank practices undermine the autonomy of individuals by not giving individuals a right to consent or an actionable right to opt-out of the transfer of these legacy samples to the biobank. This is due to the fact that individuals are not given effective notification of such transfers. Thus, issues regarding the legal status of the biobank samples and the social sustainability of biobank operations remain a challenge for biobanks in Finland despite governmental efforts to create pioneering, comprehensive, and enabling legislation.

AB Loss of function of BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is observed in about 50% of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this aspect could be exploited for targeted therapy. A genetically engineered model was established expressing either functional or non-functional BAP1 and whole-genome siRNA synthetic lethality screens were performed assessing differentially impaired survival between the two cell lines. The whole-genome siRNA screen unexpectedly revealed 11 hits (FDR<0.05) that were more cytotoxic to BAP1-proficient cells. Two actionable targets, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalytic subunit M1 (RRM1) and RNR regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), were validated. In line with the screen results, primary mesothelioma (BAP1+/-) overexpressing BAP1 C91A (catalytically dead mutant) were more resistant to RNR inhibition, while BAP1 knockdown in the BAP1-proficient cell lines rescued the cells from their vulnerability to RNR depletion. Gemcitabine and hydroxyurea were more cytotoxic in BAP1-proficient cell line-derived spheroids compared to BAP1-deficient. Upregulation of RRM2 upon gemcitabine and hydroxyurea treatment was more profound in BAP1 mut/del cell lines. Increased lethality mediated by RNR inhibition was observed in NCI-H2452 cells reconstituted with BAP1-WT but not with BAP1 C91A. Upregulation of RRM2 in NCI-H2452-BAP1 WT spheroids was modest compared to control or C91A mutant. Together, we found that BAP1 is involved in the regulation of RNR levels during replication stress. Our observations reveal a potential clinical application where BAP1 status could serve as predictive or stratification biomarker for RNR inhibition-based therapy in MPM.

AB Medical and epidemiological documentation in disasters is pivotal: the former for recording patient care and the latter for providing real-time information to the host country. Furthermore, documentation informs post-hoc analysis to improve the effectiveness of future deployments.Although documentation is considered important and indeed integral to health care response, there are many barriers and challenges. Some of these challenges include: working without well-established standards for medical documentation; and working with international guidelines which provide minimal guidance as to how health data should be managed practically to ensure accuracy and completion. Furthermore, there is a shift in mindset in disaster contexts wherein most health care focus shifts to direct clinical care and diverts almost all attention from quality documentation.This report distinguishes between the tasks of the epidemiologist and the data manager (DM) in an emergency medical team (EMT) and discusses the importance of data collection in the specific case of an EMT deployment. While combining these roles is sometimes possible if resources are limited, it is better to separate them, as the two are quite distinct. Although there is overlap, to achieve the goals of either role, preferentially they should be carried out by two people working closely together with complementary skill sets. The main objective of this report is to provide guidance and task descriptions to EMTs and field hospitals when training, recruiting, and preparing DMs and epidemiologists to work within their teams. Clear delineation of tasks will lead to better quality data, as it commits DMs to being concerned with the provision of real-time documentation from patient arrival through to compiling daily reports. It also commits epidemiologists to providing enhanced disease surveillance; outbreak investigation; and a source of reliable and actionable information for decision makers and stakeholders in the disaster management cycle.

AB BACKGROUND: Progress towards universal health coverage requires health policies and systems that are informed by contextualised and actionable research. Many challenges impede the uptake of evidence to enhance health policy implementation and the coverage, quality, efficiency and equity of health systems. To address this need, we developed an innovative model of implementation research embedded in real-world policy and programme cycles and led directly by policy-makers and health systems decision-makers. The approach was tested in ten settings in Latin America and the Caribbean, supported under a common funding and capacity strengthening initiative. The present study aims to analyse ten embedded implementation research projects in order to identify barriers and facilitators to embedding research into policy and practice as well as to assess the programme, policy and systems improvements and the cross-cutting lessons in conducting research embedded in real-world policy and systems decision-making.; METHODS: The multi-country analysis is based on the triangulation of data collected via three methods, namely (1) document review, (2) an electronic questionnaire and (3) in-depth interviews with decision-makers. Data from the document review was charted and narratively synthesised. Data from the questionnaire was used to assess three characteristics of the decision-maker's participation in embedded research, namely (1) level of engagement in different stages of research; (2) extent to which their capacities to conduct and use research were developed; and (3) the level of confidence in undertaking implementation research activities. Interview data was analysed using a thematic approach.; RESULTS: The main barriers to effective delivery or scale-up of health interventions identified in the research projects were inadequate financing, fragmentation of healthcare services and information systems, limited capacity of health system stakeholders, insufficient time, cultural factors, and a lack of information. Decision-makers' experience in embedded research showed strong engagement in protocol development, moderate engagement in data collection and low engagement in data analysis. The in-depth interviews identified 17 facilitators and 8 barriers to embedding research into policy and systems. The principal facilitating factors were actionability of findings, relevance of research and engagement of decision-makers, whereas the main barriers were time and political processes. In Argentina, the research led to the development of new monitoring indicators to improve the implementation of the perinatal health policy, while in Chile, empirical findings supported the establishment of a training programme on reproductive rights, targeted to municipal health facilities.; CONCLUSIONS: This multi-country analysis contributes to the evidence base for the embedded research approach to support health policy and systems decisions-making. Embedding research into policy and practice stimulates the relevance and applicability of research, while promoting decision-makers' engagement and likelihood to use research evidence in policy-making and health systems strengthening.

AB Every year, there are larger and more severe disasters and health organizations are struggling to respond with services to keep public health systems running. Making decisions with limited health information can negatively affect response activities and impact morbidity and mortality. An overarching challenge is getting the right health information to the right health service personnel at the right time. As responding agencies engage in social media (eg, Twitter, Facebook) to communicate with the public, new opportunities emerge to leverage this non-traditional information for improved situational awareness. Transforming these big data is dependent on computers to process and filter content for health information categories relevant to health responders. To enable a more health-focused approach to social media analysis during disasters, 2 major research challenges should be addressed: (1) advancing methodologies to extract relevant information for health services and creating dynamic knowledge bases that address both the global and US disaster contexts, and (2) expanding social media research for disaster informatics to focus on health response activities. There is a lack of attention on health-focused social media research beyond epidemiologic surveillance. Future research will require approaches that address challenges of domain-aware, including multilingual language understanding in artificial intelligence for disaster health information extraction. New research will need to focus on the primary goal of health providers, whose priority is to get the right health information to the right medical and public health service personnel at the right time.

AB PURPOSE: Molecular profiling has been used to select patients for targeted therapy and determine prognosis. Noninvasive strategies are critical to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) given the challenge of obtaining liver tissue biopsies.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed blood samples from 206 patients with HCC using comprehensive genomic testing (Guardant Health) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).; RESULTS: A total of 153/206 (74.3%) were men; median age, 62 years (range, 18-91 years). A total of 181/206 patients had ≥1 alteration. The total number of alterations was 680 (nonunique); median number of alterations/patient was three (range, 1-13); median mutant allele frequency (% cfDNA), 0.49% (range, 0.06%-55.03%). TP53 was the common altered gene [>120 alterations (non-unique)] followed by EGFR, MET, ARID1A, MYC, NF1, BRAF, and ERBB2 [20-38 alterations (nonunique)/gene]. Of the patients with alterations, 56.9% (103/181) had ≥1 actionable alterations, most commonly in MYC, EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, CCNE1, MET, PIK3CA, ARID1A, CDK6, and KRAS. In these genes, amplifications occurred more frequently than mutations. Hepatitis B (HBV)-positive patients were more likely to have ERBB2 alterations, 35.7% (5/14) versus 8.8% HBV-negative (P = 0.04).; CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first large-scale analysis of blood-derived ctDNA in HCC in United States. The genomic distinction based on HCC risk factors and the high percentage of potentially actionable genomic alterations suggests potential clinical utility for this technology. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB INTRODUCTION: There are two concurrent and novel major research pathways toward strategies for HIV control: 1) long-acting ART formulations, and 2) research aimed at conferring sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free HIV remission, considered a step towards an HIV cure. The importance of perspectives from people living with HIV on the development of new modalities is high but data are lacking.; METHODS: We administered an online survey in which respondents selected their likelihood of participation or non-participation in HIV cure/remission research based on potential risks and perceived benefits of these new modalities. We also tested the correlation between perceptions of potential risks and benefits with preferences of virologic control strategies and/or responses to scenario choices, while controlling for respondent characteristics.; RESULTS: Of the 282 eligible respondents, 42% would be willing to switch from oral daily ART to long-acting ART injectables or implantables taken at 6 month intervals, and 24% to a hypothetical ART-free remission strategy. We found statistically significant gender differences in perceptions of risk and preferences of HIV control strategies, and possible psychosocial factors that could mediate willingness to switch to novel HIV treatment or remission options.; DISCUSSION: Our study yielded data on possible desirable product characteristics for future HIV treatment and remission options. Findings also revealed differences in motivations and preferences across gender and other socio-demographic characteristics that may be actionable as part of research recruitment efforts. The diversity of participant perspectives reveals the need to provide a variety of therapeutic options to PLWHIV and to acknowledge their diverse experiential expertise when developing novel HIV therapies.

AB Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a mismatch repair-deficiency (MMR-D)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) phenotype carries unique characteristics such as increased tumour mutational burden and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Studies have shown a sustained clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors with dramatic clinical improvement in patients with MSI-H/MMR-D CRC. However, the observed response rates range between 30% and 50% suggesting the existence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Moreover, disease progression after an initial positive response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment points to acquired resistance mechanisms. In this review article, we discuss the clinical trials that established the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with MSI-H/MMR-D CRC, consider biomarkers of the immune response and elaborate on potential mechanisms related to intrinsic and acquired resistance. We also provide a perspective on possible future therapeutic approaches that might improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with actionable resistance mechanisms.

AB BACKGROUND: Simulation is being increasingly integrated into medical education. Diabetes simulation is well-received by trainees and has demonstrated improved clinical results, including reduced adult inpatient hyperglycemia. However, no pediatric-specific diabetes simulation programs exist for use in medical education. None of the existing diabetes models incorporate ketones as an input or an output, which is essential for use in teaching pediatric diabetes management.; METHODS: We created a pediatric diabetes simulation incorporating both blood sugar and urine ketones as output. Ketone output is implemented as a state variable but is obfuscated to simulate hospital experience. Blood sugar output is similar to other models and incorporates the current blood sugar, insulin on board (IOB) and carbohydrates on board (COB), and insulin and carbohydrate sensitivities. The program calculates all IOB and COB every 15 minutes based on user input and provides written summary feedback at the end of the simulation about inaccurate dosing and timing.; RESULTS: The simulation realistically incorporated both blood glucose and urine ketones in clinically valid and actionable formats. After completing this simulation, 16/17 pediatric residents indicated that they wanted more simulated diabetes cases integrated into their curriculum.; CONCLUSION: Implementing simulation into pediatric diabetes education was feasible and well-received. More work is needed to further study the role of simulation in pediatric diabetes education when used adjunctively or in lieu of lectures when time or resources are limited.

AB OBJECTIVE: Clozapine is the only approved strategy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although it is highly underutilized. We aim to generate practical and actionable evidence-based recommendations for the use of this drug considering prescription barriers.; METHOD: Narrative review.; RESULTS: A consistent body of evidence supports the efficacy of clozapine reducing morbidity and mortality in schizophrenia. The main obstacles to its use are the lack of experience by prescribers and perceived treatment burden. Systematic screening of eligibility, utilization of available resources for consultation, developing a professional network with other stakeholders, as well as optimizing how clozapine is presented to patients is discussed. Furthermore, specific evidence-based recommendations for initiation, maintenance, and safety monitoring with clozapine are provided.; CONCLUSION: Clozapine prescription is one of the areas in psychiatry with the greatest mismatch between efficacy and utilization in clinical practice. Although multiple barriers to the use of clozapine exist, some of these may be overcome by updates of routine clinical practice. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB The goal of this study was to demonstrate the spectrum of genomic alterations present in the residual disease of patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), including matched pretreatment biopsies. During the study period between 2006 and 2017, we collected pre- and post-NAC tumor tissue samples from patients with advanced HGSOC. We performed combined next-generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry to identify actionable targets and pathway activation in post-NAC residual tumors. We also examined whether post-NAC profiling of residual HGSOC identified targetable molecular lesions in the chemotherapy-resistant component of tumors. Among 102 post-NAC samples, 41 (40%) of patients had mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (HRR deficiency). Patients with HRR mutations had higher tumor mutation burdens (p <0.001) and higher alterations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (p =0.004) than patients without these HRR mutations. Nevertheless, we found no significant differences in progression-free survival (p =0.662) and overall survival (OS) (p =0.828) between the two groups. Most patients (91%) had alterations in at least one of the targetable pathways, and those patients with cell cycle (p =0.004) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling (p =0.005) pathway alterations had poorer OS (Bonferroni-corrected threshold=0.0083, 0.05/6). We showed the genomic landscape of tumor cells remaining in advanced HGSOC after NAC. Once validated, these data can help inform biomarker-driven adjuvant studies in targeting residual tumors to improve the outcomes of patients with advanced HGSOC after NAC.

AB African Americans have a 2- to 4-fold greater incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than whites, which has long raised the possibility of a genetic cause for this disparity. Recent advances in genetic studies have shown a causal association of polymorphisms at the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) with the markedly increased risk for the nondiabetic component of the overall disparity in ESKD in African Americans. Although APOL1-associated kidney disease is thought to account for a substantial proportion of ESKD in African Americans, not all the increased risk for ESKD is accounted for, and a complete cataloging of disparities in genetic causes of ESKD eludes our current understanding of genetic-associated kidney disease. Genetic testing aids the screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases with a genetic basis. Widespread use of genetic testing in clinical practice is limited by the small number of actionable genetic variants, limited health literacy of providers and patients, and underlying complex ethical, legal, and social issues. This perspective reviews racial and ethnic differences associated with genetic diseases and the development of ESKD in African Americans and discusses potential uncertainties associated with our current understanding of penetrance of genetically linked kidney disease and population-attributable risk percent.

AB Botanical safety science continues to evolve as new tools for risk assessment become available alongside continual desire by consumers for "natural" botanical ingredients in consumer products. Focusing on botanical food/dietary supplements a recent international roundtable meeting brought together scientists to discuss the needs, available tools, and ongoing data gaps in the botanical safety risk assessment process. Participants discussed the key elements of botanical safety evaluations. They provided perspective on the use of a decision tree methodology to conduct a robust risk assessment and concluded with alignment on a series of consensus statements. This discussion highlighted the strengths and vulnerabilities in common assumptions, and the participants shared additional perspective to ensure that this end-to-end safety approach is sufficient, actionable and timely. Critical areas and data gaps were identified as opportunities for future focus. These include, better context on history of use, systematic assessment of weight of evidence, use of in silico approaches, inclusion of threshold of toxicological concern considerations, individual substances/matrix interactions of plant constituents, assessing botanical-drug interactions and adaptations needed to apply to in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic modelling of botanical constituents.

AB Health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSSs) provide a foundation for characterizing and defining priorities and strategies for improving population health. The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) project aims to inform policy to prevent child deaths through generating causes of death from surveillance data combined with innovative diagnostic and laboratory methods. Six of the 7 sites that constitute the CHAMPS network have active HDSSs: Mozambique, Mali, Ethiopia, Kenya, Bangladesh, and South Africa; the seventh, in Sierra Leone, is in the early planning stages. This article describes the network of CHAMPS HDSSs and their role in the CHAMPS project. To generate actionable health and demographic data to prevent child deaths, the network depends on reliable demographic surveillance, and the HDSSs play this crucial role. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite a strong theoretical rationale for combining water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) interventions to improve child health, study findings are heterogeneous with little understanding of the mechanisms for these effects. Our study objective was to demonstrate the utility of structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess intervention effects on height-for-age z score (HAZ) through the complex system of WaSH pathways.; METHODS: We used data from a matched cohort effectiveness evaluation of a combined on-premise piped water and improved sanitation intervention in rural Odisha, India. Height/length was measured in children 0-59months old (n=1826) from 90 matched villages in February-June 2016. WaSH behaviours and infrastructure were assessed through household surveys and observation, respectively. We used SEM to calculate the standardized path coefficients and the total contributions of WaSH pathways to HAZ.; RESULTS: Intervention improvements on HAZ were through the sanitation pathway (coverage  use beta: 0.722; use  HAZ beta: 0.116), with piped water coverage indirectly affecting HAZ through improved sanitation use (beta: 0.148). Although the intervention had a positive association with handwashing station coverage, there was no evidence of a total hygiene pathway effect on HAZ or further direct effects through the water pathways.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of SEM to assess the mechanisms through which combined WaSH interventions impact HAZ as a system of pathways, providing a more nuanced assessment than estimation of the total intervention effect. Our finding, that water impacts HAZ through the sanitation pathway, is an important and actionable insight for WaSH programming. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Background: Black patients have been historically underrepresented in studies investigating molecular patterns in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to investigate differences in actionable mutations among patients at our urban, diverse medical center. Results: 146 patients were included (59 black, 76 white, 7 Asian, 3 Hispanic, 1 mixed). 35 patients had a targetable mutation. Seven black patients (11.8%) had a targetable mutation compared to 28 non-black patients (32.2%, p = 0.005). 15 black patients had PD-L1 expression ≥50% compared to 19 non-black (25.4% vs 21.8%, p = 0.69). Black patients had a higher TMB compared to non-black (15.3 mutations/Mb compared to 11.5 mutations/Mb, p = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, TMB was driven by smoking (p < 0.01), without any additive interaction in black patients who smoke (p = 0.8). Conclusion: NSCLC tumors from black patients had a higher TMB and were less likely to carry a targetable mutation. The higher TMB seen was driven by a higher prevalence of smoking among black patients in our study, which may not reflect nationwide trends. Our results serve as a proof of concept that differences in molecular markers exist between black and non-black patients, and that these differences may impact the treatment options available to black patients. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC who underwent both PD-L1 testing and massively parallel sequencing (UCM-OncoPlus) was conducted. We examined whether high PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and presence of targetable mutations (EGFR, BRAF, ERBB2, RET or ALK translocations, ROS1 rearrangements) occur at different frequencies in tumors from black patients compared to non-black patients.

AB For approximately 80 drugs, widely recognized pharmacogenetics dosing guidelines are available. However, the use of these guidelines in clinical practice remains limited as only a fraction of patients is subjected to pharmacogenetic screening. We investigated the feasibility of repurposing whole exome sequencing (WES) data for a panel of 42 variants in 11 pharmacogenes to provide a pharmacogenomic profile. Existing diagnostic WES-data from child-parent trios totalling 1,583 individuals were used. Results were successfully extracted for 39 variants. No information could be extracted for three variants, located in CYP2C19, UGT1A1 and CYP3A5, and for CYP2D6 copy number. At least one actionable phenotype was present in 86% of the individuals. Haplotype phasing proved relevant for CYP2B6 assignments as 1.5% of the phenotypes were corrected after phasing. In conclusion, repurposing WES-data can yield meaningful pharmacogenetic profiles for 7 out of 11 important pharmacogenes which can be used to guide drug treatment. © 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB Enhancer RNA (eRNA) is a type of noncoding RNA transcribed from the enhancer. Although critical roles of eRNA in gene transcription control have been increasingly realized, the systemic landscape and potential function of eRNAs in cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the integration of multi-omics and pharmacogenomics data across large-scale patient samples and cancer cell lines. We observe a cancer-/lineage-specificity of eRNAs, which may be largely driven by tissue-specific TFs. eRNAs are involved in multiple cancer signaling pathways through putatively regulating their target genes, including clinically actionable genes and immune checkpoints. They may also affect drug response by within-pathway or cross-pathway means. We characterize the oncogenic potential and therapeutic liability of one eRNA, NET1e, supporting the clinical feasibility of eRNA-targeted therapy. We identify a panel of clinically relevant eRNAs and developed a user-friendly data portal. Our study reveals the transcriptional landscape and clinical utility of eRNAs in cancer.

AB Metastatic biopsy programmes combined with advances in genomic sequencing have provided new insights into the molecular landscape of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), identifying actionable targets, and emerging resistance mechanisms. The detection of DNA repair aberrations, such as mutation of BRCA2, could help select patients for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor or platinum chemotherapy, and mismatch repair gene defects and microsatellite instability have been associated with responses to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Poor prognostic features, such as the presence of RB1 deletion, might help guide future therapeutic strategies. Our understanding of the molecular features of CRPC is now being translated into theclinic in the form of increased molecular testing for use of these agents and for clinical trial eligibility. Genomic testing offers opportunities for improving patient selection for systemic therapies and, ultimately, patient outcomes. However, challenges for precision oncology in advanced prostate cancer still remain, including the contribution of tumour heterogeneity, thetiming and potential cooperation of multiple driver gene aberrations, and diverse resistant mechanisms. Defining the optimal use of molecular biomarkers in the clinic, including tissue-based and liquid biopsies, is a rapidly evolving field.

AB The number of patients dialyzed for ESKD exceeds 500,000 in the United States and more than 2.6 million people worldwide, with the expectation that the worldwide number will double by 2030. The human cost of health and societal financial cost of ESKD is substantial. Dialytic therapy is associated with an unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rate and poor quality of life. Although innovation in many areas of science has been transformative, there has been little innovation in dialysis or alternatives for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) since its introduction approximately 70 years ago. Advances in kidney biology, stem cells and kidney cell differentiation protocols, biomaterials, sensors, nano/microtechnology, sorbents and engineering, and interdisciplinary approaches and collaborations can lead to disruptive innovation. The Kidney Health Initiative, a public-private partnership between the American Society of Nephrology and the US Food and Drug Administration, has convened a multidisciplinary group to create a technology roadmap for innovative approaches to KRT to address patients' needs. The Roadmap is a living document. It identifies the design criteria that must be considered to replace the myriad functions of the kidney, as well as scientific, technical, regulatory, and payor milestones required to commercialize and provide patient access to KRT alternatives. Various embodiments of potential solutions are discussed, but the Roadmap is agnostic to any particular solution set. System enablers are identified, including vascular access, biomaterial development, biologic and immunologic modulation, function, and safety monitoring. Important Roadmap supporting activities include regulatory alignment and innovative financial incentives and payment pathways. The Roadmap provides estimated timelines for replacement of specific kidney functions so that approaches can be conceptualized in ways that are actionable and attract talented innovators from multiple disciplines. The Roadmap has been used to guide the selection of KidneyX prizes for innovation in KRT. Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.

AB BACKGROUND: Cardiac tumors are rare and complex entities. Surgery represents the cornerstone of therapy, while the role of adjuvant treatment remains unclear and, in case of relapse or metastatic disease, the prognosis is very poor. Lack of prospective, randomized clinical trials hinders the generation of high level evidence for the optimal diagnostic workup and multimodal treatment of cardiac sarcomas. Herein, we describe the multidisciplinary clinical management and molecular characterization of a rare case of cardiac myxofibrosarcoma in an elderly woman.; CASE SUMMARY: A 73-year-old woman presented signs and symptoms of acute left-sided heart failure. Imaging examination revealed a large, left atrial mass. With suspicion of a myxoma, she underwent surgery, and symptoms were promptly relieved. Histology showed a cardiac myxofibrosarcoma, a rare histotype of cardiac sarcoma. Eight months later, disease unfortunately relapsed, and after a multidisciplinary discussion, a chemotherapy with doxorubicin and then gemcitabine was started, achieving partial radiologic and complete metabolic response, which was maintained up to 2 years and is still present. This report is focused on the entire clinical path of our patient from diagnosis to follow-up, through surgery and strategies adopted at relapse. Moreover, due to their rarity, very little is known about the molecular landscape of myxofibrosarcomas. Thus, we also performed and described preliminary genome analysis of the tumor tissue to get further insight on mechanisms involved in tumor growth, and to possibly unveil new clinically actionable targets.; CONCLUSION: We report a case of cardiac myxofibrosarcoma that achieved a very good prognosis due to an integrated surgical, cardiac and oncologic treatment strategy. ©The Author(s) 2019.

AB AIMS: This study aimed to translate the eight-item Actionable Bladder Symptom Screening Tool (ABSST) and determine its psychometric properties in Turkish speaking subjects.; METHODS: The study was conducted at the multiple sclerosis (MS) outpatient clinic of the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. First, the ABSST was translated into Turkish by an expert panel. We employed the back translation method for linguistic validation. Cronbach's alpha and test-retest analysis were performed for reliability analysis. The overactive bladder-v8 (OAB-v8) questionnaire was also administered for concurrent validation, and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and multiple sclerosis quality of life scale-54 (MSQL-54) were used to evaluate construct validity.; RESULTS: One hundred and five patients (84 females; mean age, 39.5±11.6 years; mean EDSS score, 3.2±1.8) participated in the study. Mean duration of MS was 9.7±8.3 years, and most (n=96; 91.5%) had relapsing-remitting MS. The mean ABSST score was 9.7±5.8 (range, 0-21). Highest scores were obtained from urgency and frequency, and the lowest from psychosocial effects of lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.856, and item-total score correlations ranged between 0.485 and 0.845. Correlations of ABSST scores with OAB-v8, EDSS, and MSQL-54 scales were significant (P<.001). According to the questionnaire, 38.1% (n=40) of the patients needed a referral to a urologist or gynecologist for their LUT symptoms.; CONCLUSIONS: The Turkish version of the ABSST is a valid and reliable screening tool that can be used to identify LUT symptoms in an MS clinic. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of scientific data, where human-related biological databases have grown not only in count but also in volume, posing unprecedented challenges in data storage, processing, analysis, exchange, and curation. Next generation sequencing (NGS) advancements have facilitated and accelerated the process of identifying genetic variations. Adopting NGS with Whole-Genome and RNA sequencing in a diagnostic context has the potential to improve disease-risk detection in support of precision medicine and drug discovery. Several bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to strengthen variant interpretation by efficiently processing and analyzing sequence data, whereas many published results show how genomics data can be proactively incorporated into medical practices and improve utilization of clinical information. To utilize the wealth of genomics and health, there is a crucial need to generate appropriate gene-disease annotation repositories accessed through modern technology.; RESULTS: Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to actionable genes and classified diseases, considered the foundation for clinical genomics and precision medicine. We present a publicly available iOS app, PAS-Gen, which invites global users to freely download it on iPhone and iPad devices, quickly adopt its easy to use interface, and search for genes and related diseases. PAS-Gen was developed using Swift, XCODE, and PHP scripting that uses Web and MySQL database servers, which includes over 59,000 protein-coding and non-coding genes, and over 90,000 classified gene-disease associations. PAS-Gen is founded on the clinical and scientific premise that easier healthcare and genomics data sharing will accelerate future medical discoveries.; CONCLUSIONS: We present a cutting-edge gene-disease database with a smart phone application, integrating information on classified diseases and related genes. The PAS-Gen app will assist researchers, medical practitioners, and pharmacists by providing a broad and view of genes that may be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. This tool with accelerate users' abilities to understand the genetic basis of human complex diseases and by assimilating genomic and phenotypic data will support future work to identify gene-specific designer drugs, target precise molecular fingerprints for tumors, suggest appropriate drug therapies, predict individual susceptibility to disease, and diagnose and treat rare illnesses.

AB Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) has emerged as an effective therapeutic target due to its ability to regulate DNA damage repair in human cancers, but little is known about the role of CDK12 in driving tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that CDK12 promotes tumor initiation as a novel regulator of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and induces anti-HER2 therapy resistance in human breast cancer. High CDK12 expression caused by concurrent amplification of CDK12 and HER2 in breast cancer patients is associated with disease recurrence and poor survival. CDK12 induces self-renewal of breast CSCs and invivo tumor-initiating ability, and also reduces susceptibility to trastuzumab. Furthermore, CDK12 kinase activity inhibition facilitates anticancer efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2+ tumors, and mice bearing trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ tumor show sensitivity to an inhibitor of CDK12. Mechanistically, the catalytic activity of CDK12 is required for the expression of genes involved in the activation of ErbB-PI3K-AKT or WNT-signaling cascades. These results suggest that CDK12 is a major oncogenic driver and an actionable target for HER2+ breast cancer to replace or augment current anti-HER2 therapies. © 2019 The Authors.

AB The regulators of mitochondrial cell death in cancer have remained elusive, hampering the development of new therapies. Here, we showed that protein isoforms of Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF1 and MFF2), a molecule that controls mitochondrial size and shape, i.e. mitochondrial dynamics, were overexpressed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and formed homo- and heterodimeric complexes with the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), a key regulator of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. MFF inserted into the interior hole of the VDAC1 ring using Arg225, Arg236 and Gln241 as key contact sites. A cell-permeable MFF Ser223-Leu243 D-enantiomeric peptidomimetic disrupted the MFF-VDAC1 complex, acutely depolarized mitochondria and triggered cell death in heterogeneous tumor types, including drug-resistant melanoma, but had no effect on normal cells. In preclinical models, treatment with the MFF peptidomimetic was well-tolerated and demonstrated anticancer activity in patient-derived xenografts, primary breast and lung adenocarcinoma 3D organoids and glioblastoma neurospheres. These data identify the MFF-VDAC1 complex as a novel regulator of mitochondrial cell death and an actionable therapeutic target in cancer. Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) systems are being widely implemented to facilitate medication safety improvement. However, translating the resulting big data into actionable knowledge has received relatively little attention.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to use routinely collected EPMA data in the study of exact time discrepancy between physicians' order and nurses' administration of systemic antibiotics. We evaluated first and follow-up dose administration and dose intervals and examined multifactorial determinants in ordering and administration explaining potential discrepancy.; METHODS: We conducted an observational study of electronic health records for all medical patient stays with antibiotic treatment from January to June 2018 (n=4392) in a large Belgian tertiary care hospital. Using an EPMA system with Barcode Medication Administration, we calculated time discrepancy between order and administration of first doses (n=6233), follow-up doses (n=87 960), and dose intervals. Multiple logistic regression analysis estimated the association between time discrepancy and various determinants in ordering and administration.; RESULTS: Time discrepancy between physician order and nurse administration was <30 minutes for 48.7% of first doses and 61.7% of follow-up doses, with large variation across primary diagnoses. Greater dose intervals, oral versus intravenous administration, and order diversion from regular nurse administration rounds showed strongest association with less timely administration.; CONCLUSIONS: EPMA systems show huge potential to generate actionable knowledge. Concerning antibiotic treatment, having physicians' orders coincide with regular nurse administration rounds whenever clinically appropriate, further taking contextual factors into account, could potentially improve antibiotic administration timeliness.

AB Semaphorins, specifically type IV, are important regulators of axonal guidance and have been increasingly implicated in poor prognoses in a number of different solid cancers. In conjunction with their cognate PLXNB family receptors, type IV members have been increasingly shown to mediate oncogenic functions necessary for tumor development and malignant spread. In this study, we investigated the role of semaphorin 4C (SEMA4C) in osteosarcoma growth, progression, and metastasis. We investigated the expression and localization of SEMA4C in primary osteosarcoma patient tissues and its tumorigenic functions in these malignancies. We demonstrate that overexpression of SEMA4C promotes properties of cellular transformation, while RNAi knockdown of SEMA4C promotes adhesion and reduces cellular proliferation, colony formation, migration, wound healing, tumor growth, and lung metastasis. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by reductions in activated AKT signaling, G1 cell cycle delay, and decreases in expression of mesenchymal marker genes SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. Lastly, monoclonal antibody blockade of SEMA4C in vitro mirrored that of the genetic studies. Together, our results indicate a multi-dimensional oncogenic role for SEMA4C in metastatic osteosarcoma and more importantly that SEMA4C has actionable clinical potential.

AB Importance: Performing DNA genetic testing (DGT) for hereditary cancer genes is now a well-accepted clinical practice; however, the interpretation of DNA variation remains a challenge for laboratories and clinicians. Adding RNA genetic testing (RGT) enhances DGT by clarifying the clinical actionability of hereditary cancer gene variants, thus improving clinicians' ability to accurately apply strategies for cancer risk reduction and treatment.; Objective: To evaluate whether RGT is associated with improvement in the diagnostic outcome of DGT and in the delivery of personalized cancer risk management for patients with hereditary cancer predisposition.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Diagnostic study in which patients and/or families with inconclusive variants detected by DGT in genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer sent blood samples for RGT from March 2016 to April 2018. Clinicians who ordered genetic testing and received a reclassification report for these variants were surveyed to assess whether RGT-related variant reclassifications changed clinical management of these patients. To quantify the potential number of tested individuals who could benefit from RGT, a cohort of 307 812 patients who underwent DGT for hereditary cancer were separately queried to identify variants predicted to affect splicing. Data analysis was conducted from March 2016 and September 2018.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Variant reclassification outcomes following RGT, clinical management changes associated with RGT-related variant reclassifications, and the proportion of patients who would likely be affected by a concurrent DGT and RGT multigene panel testing approach.; Results: In total, 93 if 909 eligible families (10.2%) submitted samples for RGT. Evidence from RGT clarified the interpretation of 49 of 56 inconclusive cases (88%) studied; 26 (47%) were reclassified as clinically actionable and 23 (41%) were clarified as benign. Variant reclassifications based on RGT results changed clinical management recommendations for 8 of 18 patients (44%) and 14 of 18 families (78%), based on responses from 18 of 45 clinicians (40%) surveyed. A total of 7265 of 307 812 patients who underwent DGT had likely pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance potentially affecting splicing, indicating that approximately 1 in 43 individuals could benefit from RGT.; Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic study, conducting RNA testing resolved a substantial proportion of variants of uncertain significance in a cohort of individuals previously tested for cancer predisposition by DGT. Performing RGT might change the diagnostic outcome of at least 1 in 43 patients if performed in all individuals undergoing genetic evaluation for hereditary cancer.

AB AIMS: Overactive bladder (OAB) remains underdiagnosed with many patients never seeking medical help. Methods to aid early identification and treatment of OAB will be hugely beneficial, and to this end several case-finding tools have been developed. The aim of this review is to critically analyse the literature regarding case-finding tools that have been validated specifically for the detection of OAB in women.; METHODS: A literature search of the PubMed database was performed until July 2019 using the search terms screening and OAB or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Names of individual case-finding tools included in the sixth International Consultation on Incontinence were also searched on the PubMed database. Original articles on the validation of patient-reported screening questionnaires for the detection of OAB in women were included.; RESULTS: A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The validation studies of 11 case-finding tools were assessed. All demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity for OAB or incontinence symptoms, and five tools have been most extensively validated for this condition (bladder control self-assessment questionnaire [B-SAQ], OAB-V8, OAB-V3, OAB symptom score, and questionnaire for urinary incontinence diagnosis). B-SAQ and OAB-V8 demonstrated high sensitivity whilst actionable bladder symptom screening tool was the most specific. B-SAQ was the only tool in this review to encompass screening for "red-flag" symptoms (hematuria, pain), and it has also been validated in a primary care setting.; CONCLUSIONS: Several case-finding tools have been demonstrated to have high accuracy for diagnosing OAB in women. B-SAQ encompasses other LUTS as well as "red-flag" symptoms; its use should be promoted in primary care. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Implant malalignment may predispose patients to prosthetic failure following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A more thorough understanding of the surgeon-specific factors that contribute to implant malalignment following TKA may uncover actionable strategies for improving implant survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of surgeon volume and training status on malalignment.; METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we performed a radiographic analysis of 1,570 primary TKAs performed at 4 private academic and state-funded centers in the U.S. and U.K. Surgeons were categorized as high-volume (≥50 TKAs/year) or low-volume (<50 TKAs/year), and as a trainee (fellow/resident under the supervision of an attending surgeon) or a non-trainee (attending surgeon). On the basis of these designations, 3 groups were defined: high-volume non-trainee, low-volume non-trainee, and trainee. The postoperative medial distal femoral angle (DFA), medial proximal tibial angle (PTA), and posterior tibial slope angle (PSA) were radiographically measured. Outlier measurements were defined as follows: DFA, outside of 5° ± 3° of valgus; PTA, >±3° deviation from the neutral axis; and PSA, <0° or >7° of flexion for cruciate-retaining or <0° or >5° of flexion for posterior-stabilized TKAs. "Far outliers" were defined as measurements falling >± 2° outside of these ranges. The proportions of outliers were compared between the groups using univariate and multivariate analyses.; RESULTS: When comparing the high and low-volume non-trainee groups using univariate analysis, the proportions of knees with outlier measurements for the PTA (5.3% versus 17.4%) and PSA (17.4% versus 28.3%) and the proportion of total outliers (11.8% versus 20.7%) were significantly lower in the high-volume group (all p < 0.001). The proportions of DFA (1.9% versus 6.5%), PTA (1.8% versus 5.7%), PSA (5.5% versus 12.6%), and total far outliers (3.1% versus 8.3%) were also significantly lower in the high-volume non-trainee group (all p < 0.001). Compared with the trainee group, the high-volume non-trainee group had significantly lower proportions of DFA (12.6% versus 21.6%), PTA (5.3% versus 12.0%), PSA (17.4% versus 33.3%), and total outliers (11.8% versus 22.3%) (all p < 0.001) as well as DFA (1.9% versus 3.9%; p = 0.027), PSA (5.5% versus 12.6%; p < 0.001), and total far outliers (3.1% versus 6.4%; p = 0.004). No significant differences were identified when comparing the low-volume non-trainee group and the trainee group, with the exception of PTA outliers (17.4% versus 12.0%; p = 0.041) and PTA far outliers (5.7% versus 2.6%; p = 0.033). Findings from multivariate analysis accounting for the effects of patient age, body mass index, and individual surgeon demonstrated similar results.; CONCLUSIONS: Low surgical volume and trainee status were risk factors for outlier and far-outlier malalignment in primary TKA, even when accounting for differences in individual surgeon and patient characteristics. Trainee surgeons performed similarly, and certainly not inferiorly, to low-volume non-trainee surgeons. Even among high-volume non-trainees, the best-performing cohort in our study, the proportion of TKA alignment outliers was still high.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

AB This special issue of Translational Behavioral Medicine solicited papers focusing on the intersection of food security, dietary quality, and obesity. Specifically, the special issue seeks to highlight research that provides actionable takeaways related to policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) approaches for practitioners and policymakers. The purpose of this introduction was to summarize relevant background literature and then briefly introduce topics covered by the articles included in the special issue. There are economic, environmental, and social factors that create systemic barriers that drive persistent poverty in communities and underlay the intersection of food security, dietary quality, and obesity. Although equitable healthful food access is needed, the issue is exceedingly complicated. Understanding and operationalizing effective and efficient PSE approaches is in its infancy. More research is needed to better understand how to appropriately measure determinants of health (and how they relate to the conditions that ultimately promote obesity through food insecurity and compromises to dietary quality), implement deliberate interventions that address the underlying factors, and disseminate that information to policymakers and practitioners in the field. This special issue of Translational Behavioral Medicine includes articles that relay practical findings, measurement methods, and lessons learned related to PSE approaches such as federal food assistance programs (e.g., National School Lunch Program), systems-based interventions (e.g., clinic-community connections), and environmental modifications(e.g., food retail marketing). Although much more practical and action-oriented research is needed in this area, these articles will contribute to the evidence base supporting better future assessment and PSE interventions that address food security, dietary quality, and obesity. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2019.

AB Effective hospital readmission risk prediction tools exist, but do not identify actionable items that could be modified to reduce the risk of readmission. Polypharmacy has attracted attention as a potentially modifiable risk factor for readmission, showing promise in a retrospective study. Polypharmacy is a very complex issue, reflecting comorbidities and healthcare resource utilisation patterns. This investigation compares the predictive ability of polypharmacy alone to the validated HOSPITAL score and LACE index readmission risk assessment tools for all adult admissions to an academic hospitalist service at a moderate sized university-affiliated hospital in the American Midwest over a 2-year period. These results indicate that the number of discharge medications alone is not a useful tool in identifying patients at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. Further research is needed to explore the impact of polypharmacy as a risk predictor for hospital readmission. © Royal College of Physicians 2019. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy makes the case that a wide range of organizations and professionals must work together to improve health information and services to achieve a health literate society. The context and framework for this collaboration and action, however, have yet to be well-articulated. We report on our use of a community health needs assessment model to describe county and state health literacy activities, gaps, assets, and opportunities. This approach combines the public health best practice of learning about communities through systematic assessments and the emerging health literacy best practice of studying organizational behaviors.; Brief description of activity: A community health literacy assessment was implemented from January 2018 to April 2018. The purpose was to collect information about county and state-level health literacy activities, gaps, assets, and opportunities. We used this information to characterize the status of health literacy in Maryland and establish an initial baseline for county and state strategic planning work and future collaboration.; Implementation: An environmental scan of each county in Maryland identified health indicators, community resources, and health organizations or professionals. Organizational representatives participated in interviews about their health literacy work. Interviews were analyzed to identify themes as well as summarize and quantify perspectives by county. We convened a forum, disseminated preliminary findings, and performed member checking to assess agreement with the results.; Results: The team interviewed 56 individuals from 49 organizations. Themes of health literacy definitions as well as organizational ranking on the use of health literacy best practices are discussed in this article. Forty public health professionals, including 10 interview participants, attended the forum. Member checking assessed interview participants' agreement with results and interpretations, which were found to be accurate portrayals of their responses.; Lessons learned: Lessons learned include being flexible with the interview approach, performing member checking, and allowing participants to self-define health literacy. Our experience shows a small team can perform a large-scale assessment that provides actionable information at state and county-levels. The results can influence future interventions, inform strategic planning and collaboration, and lead us toward a health literate society. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2019;3(4):e216-e226.].; Plain Language Summary: A systematic community health needs assessment framework was used to collect information about health literacy activities, assets, gaps, and opportunities at the state and county level. Participant feedback showed the team accurately captured the activities, assets, gaps, and opportunities to improve health literacy practices. A needs assessment framework is feasible for describing community health literacy. © 2019 Platter, Kaplow, Baur.

AB PURPOSE: Clinical targeted sequencing panels are important for identifying actionable variants for patients with cancer; however, existing approaches do not provide transparent and rationally designed clinical panels to accommodate the rapidly growing knowledge within oncology.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) database to develop an Open-Sourced CIViC Annotation Pipeline (OpenCAP). OpenCAP provides methods to identify variants within the CIViC database, build probes for variant capture, use probes on prospective samples, and link somatic variants to CIViC clinical relevance statements. OpenCAP was tested using a single-molecule molecular inversion probe (smMIP) capture design on 27 cancer samples from 5 tumor types. In total, 2,027 smMIPs were designed to target 111 eligible CIViC variants (61.5 kb of genomic space).; RESULTS: When compared with orthogonal sequencing, CIViC smMIP sequencing demonstrated a 95% sensitivity for variant detection (n = 61 of 64 variants). Variant allele frequencies for variants identified on both sequencing platforms were highly concordant (Pearson's r = 0.885; n = 61 variants). Moreover, for individuals with paired tumor and normal samples (n = 12), 182 clinically relevant variants missed by orthogonal sequencing were discovered by CIViC smMIP sequencing.; CONCLUSION: The OpenCAP design paradigm demonstrates the utility of an open-source and open-access database built on attendant community contributions with peer-reviewed interpretations. Use of a public repository for variant identification, probe development, and variant interpretation provides a transparent approach to build dynamic next-generation sequencing-based oncology panels.

AB Objectives: As there is a dearth of information about anal cancer available at cancer centers, patients often use the Internet to search for information. This is problematic, however, because the quality of information on the Internet is variable, and the health literacy demanded is higher than the average patrons' capacity. The purposes of this study were to (1) determine the most common websites with anal cancer consumer health information, (2) identify the supportive care needs that each website addresses, and (3) evaluate the websites' quality and health literacy demand.; Methods: Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) entry terms for "Anus Neoplasms" were used in Google Canada to identify websites. Seven domains of supportive care needs were defined using Fitch's Supportive Care Framework for Cancer Care. Website quality was evaluated using the DISCERN tool. Health literacy demand was assessed using readability calculators, where best practice dictates a grade 6 or lower, and the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT) that computes a percentage score in 2 domains, understandability and actionability, with 80% being an acceptable score.; Results: Eighteen unique websites were evaluated. One website met health literacy best practices and had a "good" quality rating. Most websites addressed only 1 supportive care domain (61%), were of "fair" quality (67%), had readability scores higher than grade 6 (89%), and had PEMAT scores ranging from 41%-92% for understandability and 0-70% for actionability.; Conclusion: The information gaps on anal cancer websites warrant a need for more health literate anal cancer health information on the Internet.

AB Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is a rare peripheral T-cell lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus. It most often presents as limited-stage disease in patients of East Asian descent with a palatal deformity caused by erosion of the tumor through the hard palate. Limited-stage disease is often curable with the use of l-asparaginase-based chemotherapy and high-dose radiation therapy. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis is essential, because treatment with standard lymphoma regimens and omission of radiation severely compromise the likelihood of long-term survival. Conversely, patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis and are recommended for asparaginase-based chemotherapy followed by consolidation with autologous transplantation as a potentially curative approach. Progress often has been hampered by the rarity of this disease. However, discovery of common genetic alterations in pathways that promote growth and inhibit apoptosis, and actionable markers such as CD30 (among others), have begun to broaden the availability of novel drugs (eg, targeted therapies). There is also cautious optimism about immunotherapies, such as checkpoint blockade and novel cellular therapies that target Epstein-Barr virus. Advances in treatment and understanding of the genetic landscape of this disease offer hope for improved treatment outcomes.

AB To evaluate the clinical utility of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach-based analysis of the bacterial and fungal genome in vitreous fluids from patients clinically diagnosed as endophthalmitis, we subjected 75 vitreous fluids from clinically presumed infectious endophthalmitis patients to high-throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2500) after DNA extraction and amplification of the 16S rRNA for the detection of bacteria, and ITS 2 region for detection of fungal pathogens. As controls, we included vitreous biopsies from 70 patients diagnosed with other non-infectious retinal disorders. Following the construction of the curated microbial genome database and filtering steps to reduce ambiguousness/contaminants from the environment, the paired reads were analyzed. Our HTS reads revealed in almost all cases the same organism that was grown in culture (bacterial-14/15, fungal 3/3) by conventional microbiological workup. HTS additionally diagnosed the presence of microbes in 42/57 (73.7%) patients who were conventionally negative (fungal pathogens in 36/57, bacterial pathogens in 11/57, including five cases that showed the presence of both bacterial and fungal organisms). Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp., Exserohilum sp., and Candida sp. were the most predominant genera in our cohort of culture-negative endophthalmitis cases. Heat map based microbial clustering analysis revealed that these organisms were taxonomically similar to the species identified by conventional culture methods. Interestingly, 4/70 control samples also showed the presence of bacterial reads, although their clinical significance is uncertain. HTS is useful in detecting pathogens in endophthalmitis cases that elude conventional attempts at diagnosis and can provide actionable information relevant to management, especially where there is a high index of suspicion of fungal endophthalmitis, particularly in tropical countries. Outcome analyses and clinical trials addressing the success and cost savings of HTS for the diagnosis of endophthalmitis are recommended.

AB Limited translational genomic research data have been reported on the application of exome sequencing and parallel gene testing for preconception carrier screening (PCS). Here, we present individual-level data from a large PCS program in which exome sequencing was routinely performed on either gamete donors (5,845) or infertile patients (8,280) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment without any known family history of inheritable genetic conditions. Individual-level data on pathogenic variants were used to define conditions for PCS based on criteria for severity, penetrance, inheritance pattern, and age of onset. Fetal risk was defined based on actual carrier frequency data accounting for the specific inheritance pattern (fetal disease risk, FDR). In addition, large-scale application of exome sequencing for PCS allowed a deep investigation of the incidence of medically actionable secondary findings in this population. Exome sequencing achieved remarkable clinical sensitivity for reproductive risk of highly penetrant childhood-onset disorders (1/337 conceptions) through analysis of 114 selected gene-condition pairs. A significant contribution to fetal disease risk was observed for rare (carrier rate < 1:100) and X-linked conditions (16.7% and 41.2% of total FDR, respectively). Subgroup analysis of 776 IVF couples identified 37 at increased reproductive risk (4.8%; 95% CI = 3.4-6.5). Further, two additional couples had increased risk for very rare conditions when both members of a parental pair were treated as a unit and the search was extended to the entire exome. About 2.3% of participants showed at least one pathogenic variant for genes included in the updated American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics v2.0 list of secondary findings. Gamete donors and IVF couples showed similar carrier burden for both carrier screening and secondary findings, indicating no causal relationship to fertility. These translational research data will facilitate development of more effective PCS strategies that maximize clinical sensitivity with minimal counterproductive effects.

AB INTRODUCTION: Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was.; METHODS: To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers.; RESULTS: 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barre Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies.; CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.

AB Timely and appropriate medical care can significantly influence the health of a newborn. When considering how to best deliver such care, we must first note that each human represents the result of a balance between nature (genetics) and nurture (environment). Importantly, while most of our care is centered on in utero development, the preconception period is also a time at which genetic and environmental factors can interact to exert effects that ultimately influence the health of the future offspring. In this issue's Views and Reviews, we provide data to suggest that modern preconceptional care should become a key component of reproductive medicine, not only to improve implantation and pregnancy rates, but also to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, further optimizing the health for mothers and children and setting the stage for the child's adult life. The preconception period should be regarded as an actionable "window of opportunity" for child health promotion, not only because of this gene-environment interaction and the opportunity to identify women's genetic risks, but also because it represents a time when women are most willing to abandon unhealthy habits.

AB BACKGROUND: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) often employs attenuation-correction computed tomography (CTAC) to reduce attenuation artifacts and improve specificity. While there is no specific guideline on how they should be reported, incidental noncardiac findings identified on these scans may be clinically significant. The prevalence of these findings in veterans is not currently known. In addition, variability in reporting these findings may depend on the interpreting physician's specialty.; METHODS: To guide future decision-making, CTACs in veterans referred for MPI were prospectively evaluated in a quality-control project for a set of prespecified actionable incidental findings by cardiologists and a radiologist.; RESULTS: On the 771 scans performed over eight months, 285 incidental noncardiac findings were identified by the interpreting cardiologists and 378 were identified by the interpreting radiologist. Pulmonary nodules were the most common occurring in 20% of studies read by the radiologist. Interreader agreements between cardiologists and the radiologist were poor for pulmonary nodules≥10mm and hiatal hernias; fair for pulmonary nodules<10mm, extracardiac masses, and aortic aneurysms; and moderate for pleural plaques.; CONCLUSION: Incidental noncardiac findings on CTACs are common in our veteran population. Overall interobserver agreement in identifying these findings between cardiologists and radiologists is fair. Specific guidelines are needed on how CTACs should be read and reported.

AB BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial functions are exploited in cancer and provide a validated therapeutic target. However, how this process is regulated has remained mostly elusive and the identification of new pathways that control mitochondrial integrity in cancer is an urgent priority.; METHODS: We studied clinically-annotated patient series of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, representative cases of multiple myeloma (MM) and publicly available genetic databases. Gene regulation studies involved chromatin immunoprecipitation, PCR amplification and Western blotting of conditional Myc-expressing cell lines. Transient or stable gene silencing was used to quantify mitochondrial functions in bioenergetics, outer membrane permeability, Ca2+ homeostasis, redox balance and cell death. Tumorigenicity was assessed by cell proliferation, colony formation and xenograft tumour growth.; FINDINGS: We identified Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF) as a novel transcriptional target of oncogenic Myc overexpressed in primary and metastatic cancer, compared to normal tissues. Biochemically, MFF isoforms, MFF1 and MFF2 associate with the Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel-1 (VDAC1) at the mitochondrial outer membrane, in vivo. Disruption of this complex by MFF silencing induces general collapse of mitochondrial functions with increased outer membrane permeability, loss of inner membrane potential, Ca2+ unbalance, bioenergetics defects and activation of cell death pathways. In turn, this inhibits tumour cell proliferation, suppresses colony formation and reduces xenograft tumour growth in mice.; INTERPRETATION: An MFF-VDAC1 complex is a novel regulator of mitochondrial integrity and actionable therapeutic target in cancer.

AB PURPOSE: Few efforts have been made to integrate a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel into standard clinical treatment of ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical utility of NGS and to identify clinically impactful information beyond targetable alterations.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 84 patients with ovarian cancer who underwent NGS between March 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018, at the Yonsei Cancer Hospital. We extracted DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of ovarian cancer. The TruSight Tumor 170 gene panel was used to prepare libraries, and the MiSeq instrument was used for NGS.; RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, 55 (65.1%) had high-grade serous carcinomas. Seventy-three (86.7%) patients underwent NGS at the time of diagnosis, and 11 (13.3%) underwent NGS upon relapse. The most common genetic alterations were in TP53 (64%), PIK3CA (15%), and BRCA1/2 (13%), arising as single nucleotide variants and indels. MYC amplification (27%) was the most common copy number variation and fusion. Fifty-seven (67.9%) patients had more than one actionable alteration other than TP53. Seven (8.3%) cases received matched-target therapy based on the following sequencing results: BRCA1 or 2 mutation, poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (n=5); PIK3CA mutation, AKT inhibitor (n=1); and MLH1 mutation, PD-1 inhibitor (n=1). Fifty-three (63.0%) patients had a possibility of treatment change, and 8 (9.5%) patients received genetic counseling.; CONCLUSION: Implementation of NGS may help in identifying patients who might benefit from targeted treatment therapies and genetic counseling. © Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common cancer of bone, yet is classified as a rare cancer. Treatment and outcomes for OS have not substantively changed in several decades. While the decoding of the OS genome greatly advanced the understanding of the mutational landscape of OS, immediately actionable therapeutic targets were not apparent. Here we describe recent preclinical models that can be leveraged to identify, test, and prioritize therapeutic candidates.; RECENT FINDINGS: The generation of multiple high fidelity murine models of OS, the spontaneous disease that arises in pet dogs, and the establishment of a diverse collection of patient-derived OS xenografts provide a robust preclinical platform for OS. These models enable evidence to be accumulated across multiple stages of preclinical evaluation. Chemical and genetic screening has identified therapeutic targets, often demonstrating cross species activity. Clinical trials in both PDX models and in canine OS have effectively tested new therapies for prioritization. Improving clinical outcomes in OS has proven elusive. The integrated target discovery and testing possible through a cross species platform provides validation of a putative target and may enable the rigorous evaluation of new therapies in models where endpoints can be rapidly assessed.

AB Introduction: Due to the relatively low mutation rate and high frequency of copy number variation, finding actionable genetic drivers of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is a challenging task. Furthermore, emerging studies show that genetic alterations are frequently poorly represented at the protein level adding a layer of complexity. With improvements in large-scale proteomic technologies, proteomics studies have the potential to provide robust analysis of the pathways driving high HGSC behavior. Areas covered: This review summarizes recent large-scale proteomics findings across adequately sized ovarian cancer sample sets. Key words combined with 'ovarian cancer' including 'proteomics', 'proteogenomic', 'reverse-phase protein array', 'mass spectrometry', and 'adaptive response', were used to search PubMed. Expert opinion: Proteomics analysis of HGSC as well as their adaptive responses to therapy can uncover new therapeutic liabilities, which can reduce the emergence of drug resistance and potentially improve patient outcomes. There is a pressing need to better understand how the genomic and epigenomic heterogeneity intrinsic to ovarian cancer is reflected at the protein level and how this information could be used to improve patient outcomes.

AB Patients with pancreatic cancer have not benefited from recent improvements in overall survival brought about by precision medicine in other malignancies. This failure is not due to a dearth of precision-medicine research in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the main type of pancreatic cancer. In fact, the stalled progress in precision therapies for this type of cancer is due to the absence of agents that are able to target the common genetic alterations in PDAC. Several studies have attempted to phenotypically stratify PDAC at the transcriptional level. However, the value of such classifications will only be revealed through prospective studies and, crucially, only after development of new treatment options for this disease. Therefore, it is essential to learn from breakthrough discoveries in other cancer types that could benefit subpopulations of patients with PDAC and convert them from ordinary to exceptional responders. Identifying these exceptional patients will help to bring PDAC in line with other cancer types in terms of availability of precision therapies. Thus, the true challenge to precision medicine for PDAC might be the poor consensus on which genetic and phenotypic alterations across the spectrum of this disease are actionable; not the absence of actionable variables themselves. To reach consensus, knowledge and tools must be developed and disseminated for individuals who provide pancreatic cancer care, to enable the real-time identification of exceptional patients, more precise subgroup classifications, and effective disease management strategies; all informed by immediate feedback from clinical outcome data.

AB Symptom relapse in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is common and has a negative impact on the course of illness. Here, we describe the development of Texting for Relapse Prevention, a scalable, cost-effective text messaging relapse prevention program that queries patients' "early warning signs" daily. Results of development focus groups and content advisory teams with 25 patients and 19 providers suggest that patients were enthusiastic about the program and thought that receiving daily messages about their symptoms would help them feel supported. Providers also were positive about the idea but worried that the program might interfere with patient-provider communication if patients thought that the messages were coming from providers. Patients found the content positive and actionable. The program was improved to address this feedback. This iterative development process that included multiple stakeholders ensured that the program is feasible and acceptable to both patients and providers.

AB Climate change is a global challenge faced by everyone, but the developing countries are highly vulnerable to variations in the environment. This research focuses on the Punjab province of Pakistan and evaluates the impacts and consequences of climate change on general public at local and divisional level. In order to cope with the impacts of climatic changes at all levels, especially divisional level, raising reliable awareness and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting measures is significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector is imperative. The impacts of climate change are observed across the country through gradual increase in temperature, human health issues, pest diseases, droughts, floods, and irregular weather patterns leading to changes in lifestyles, and these issues are likely to continue in the future. The main cause of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan, can be attributed to excessive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere due to human activities involving inefficient energy usage, rapid urban expansion, improper waste management, industrial development, increasing transportation, agricultural activities, and livestock mismanagement. The findings of this study revealed that transportation sector is the major source of GHG emissions in the country, followed by industrialization and waste, at national, as well as divisional, level. The extent of impacts of climate change at divisional level is distinguishable and displayed a direct relationship with climate, geography, variation of effects, and modes of production in various regions of Punjab. The study strategically investigated all nine divisions of the province for comprehensive understanding of climate change phenomenon, and the results indicated that nearly three-fourths of the respondents have never indulged in taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study adopted a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) approach where the findings can act as set of guidelines for governmental authorities in formulating, assisting in preparation, instructing, and guiding policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation at national, local, and divisional levels.

AB PURPOSE: In biliary tract cancer (BTC), standard chemotherapy has limited benefit and no molecular targeted agents have been approved. This study investigated the genetic profile of BTC to identify potential new therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers.; METHODS: Targeted exome sequencing was performed for 124 patients with BTC [gallbladder cancer (GBC), 25; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), 55; extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), 44]. Survival analysis was performed in 112 patients who received palliative chemotherapy for locally unresectable or metastatic disease.; RESULTS: Genetic alterations were observed in 104 patients (83.8%); the most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (44.4%), KRAS (29.0%), ARID1A (12.1%)and IDH1 (9.7%). IDH1/2 mutations appeared more frequently in ICC (23.6%, P=0.0002) than in GBC (4.0%) or ECC (2.3%), while ERBB2/3 mutations were found only in GBC (20.0%) and ECC (11.4%). Patients harbouring TP53 mutations had shorter overall survival (OS; median 15.2 vs. 37.8 months, P=0.018), while IDH1 mutations showed a tendency for longer progression-free survival (PFS; 10.6 vs. 6.1 months, P=0.124). Potentially actionable genetic alterations were found in 54.8%, and 7.1% received appropriate molecular targeted therapy in the clinical trial setting. Germline or somatic mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes were found in 63.5% of patients and were significantly associated with longer PFS (6.9 vs. 5.7 months, P=0.013) and OS (21.0 vs. 13.3 months, P=0.009) in patients who received first-line platinum-containing chemotherapies (n=88).; CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with BTC may benefit from targeted therapy by the aid of genetic information. In particular, DDR alterations may be a predictive biomarker for response to platinum-containing chemotherapy inpatients with BTC. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a dilemma for cancer researchers with an increasing incidence in the younger patient population. Until the last decade, limited therapeutic options were available for metastatic CRC patients leading to relatively poor clinical outcomes.Areas covered: With advances in genome sequencing technology and reductions in the cost of next-generation sequencing, molecular profiling has become more accessible for cancer researchers and clinical investigators, which has furthered our understanding of the molecular behavior of CRC. This progress has recently translated into significant advances in molecular-based therapeutics and led to the development of new target-specific agents in metastatic CRC patients. In this review article, we extensively elaborate on genomic alterations seen in CRC patients including, but not limited to, EGFR, MMR, BRAF, HER2, NTRKs, FGFR, BRCA1/2, PALB2, POLE, and POLD1 genes, all of which are potentially actionable by either an FDA-approved agent or in a clinical trial setting.Expert opinion: We strongly recommend molecular profiling in metastatic CRC patients during the early course of their disease, as this may provide therapeutic and prognostic information that can guide clinicians to practice precision medicine. Patients with potentially actionable genes should be considered for targeting agents based on molecular alterations.

AB Disasters, such as cyclones, create conditions that increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Epidemic forecasts can be valuable for targeting highest risk populations before an outbreak. The two main barriers to routine use of real-time forecasts include scientific and operational challenges. First, accuracy may be limited by availability of data and the uncertainty associated with the inherently stochastic processes that determine when and where outbreaks happen and spread. Second, even if data are available, the appropriate channels of communication may prevent their use for decision making.In April 2019, only six weeks after Cyclone Idai devastated Mozambique's central region and sparked a cholera outbreak, Cyclone Kenneth severely damaged northern areas of the country. By June 10, a total of 267 cases of cholera were confirmed, sparking a vaccination campaign. Prior to Kenneth's landfall, a team of academic researchers, humanitarian responders, and health agencies developed a simple model to forecast areas at highest risk of a cholera outbreak. The model created risk indices for each district using combinations of four metrics: (1) flooding data; (2) previous annual cholera incidence; (3) sensitivity of previous outbreaks to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycle; and (4) a diffusion (gravity) model to simulate movement of infected travelers. As information on cases became available, the risk model was continuously updated. A web-based tool was produced, which identified highest risk populations prior to the cyclone and the districts at-risk following the start of the outbreak.The model prior to Kenneth's arrival using the metrics of previous incidence, projected flood, and El Nino sensitivity accurately predicted areas at highest risk for cholera. Despite this success, not all data were available at the scale at which the vaccination campaign took place, limiting the model's utility, and the extent to which the forecasts were used remains unclear. Here, the science behind these forecasts and the organizational structure of this collaborative effort are discussed. The barriers to the routine use of forecasts in crisis settings are highlighted, as well as the potential for flexible teams to rapidly produce actionable insights for decision making using simple modeling tools, both before and during an outbreak.

AB BACKGROUNDAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy arising in salivary glands and other sites, characterized by high rates of relapse and distant spread. Recurrent/metastatic (R/M) ACCs are generally incurable, due to a lack of active systemic therapies. To improve outcomes, deeper understanding of genetic alterations and vulnerabilities in R/M tumors is needed.METHODSAn integrated genomic analysis of 1,045 ACCs (177 primary, 868 R/M) was performed to identify alterations associated with advanced and metastatic tumors. Intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, germline mutations, and therapeutic actionability were assessed.RESULTSCompared with primary tumors, R/M tumors were enriched for alterations in key Notch (NOTCH1, 26.3% vs. 8.5%; NOTCH2, 4.6% vs. 2.3%; NOTCH3, 5.7% vs. 2.3%; NOTCH4, 3.6% vs. 0.6%) and chromatin-remodeling (KDM6A, 15.2% vs. 3.4%; KMT2C/MLL3, 14.3% vs. 4.0%; ARID1B, 14.1% vs. 4.0%) genes. TERT promoter mutations (13.1% of R/M cases) were mutually exclusive with both NOTCH1 mutations (q = 3.3 * 10-4) and MYB/MYBL1 fusions (q = 5.6 * 10-3), suggesting discrete, alternative mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This network of alterations defined 4 distinct ACC subgroups: MYB+NOTCH1+, MYB+/other, MYBWTNOTCH1+, and MYBWTTERT+. Despite low mutational load, we identified numerous samples with marked intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, including branching evolution across multiregion sequencing.CONCLUSIONThese observations collectively redefine the molecular underpinnings of ACC progression and identify further targets for precision therapies.FUNDINGAdenoid Cystic Carcinoma Research Foundation, Pershing Square Sohn Cancer Research grant, the PaineWebber Chair, Stand Up 2 Cancer, NIH R01 CA205426, the STARR Cancer Consortium, NCI R35 CA232097, the Frederick Adler Chair, Cycle for Survival, the Jayme Flowers Fund, The Sebastian Nativo Fund, NIH K08 DE024774 and R01 DE027738, and MSKCC through NIH/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (P30 CA008748).

AB BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to investigate the link between enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) in preclinical studies and in human lung cancer tissue microarrays.; METHODS: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and HDAC1 mRNA expression in two lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets (MDACC and TCGA) were correlated with patient outcomes. We evaluated the association of EZH2 and HDAC1 expression with response to the HDAC1 inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). The response to SAHA was assessed at baseline and after alteration of EZH2 or HDAC mRNA expression in LUAD cell lines.; RESULTS: Direct correlation was found between EZH2 and HDAC1 expression (P<0.0001). When EZH2 expression was knocked down- or upregulated, there was a corresponding decrease or increase in expression of HDAC expression, respectively. Cell lines with high EZH2 expression responded to SAHA treatment with a mean inhibition rate of 73.1% compared to 43.2% in cell lines with low EZH2 expression (P<0.0001). This correlation was confirmed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens from MDACC (Spearman's correlation r=0.416; P<0.0001) and TCGA datasets (r=0.221; P<0.0001). Patients with high EZH2 and high HDAC1 expression in stage I NSCLC specimens of both datasets had the lowest survival compared to the patients with low expression of either or both markers.; CONCLUSION: Our findings show that overexpression of EZH2 is a negative prognostic indicator. Increased EZH2 expression predicts for response to HDAC inhibitors and thus could serve as a biomarker for selecting NSCLC patients for treatment with HDAC inhibitors. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Aim: In a prospective clinical initiative, we selected heavily pretreated head and neck carcinoma patients and assessed the clinical utility of a protein-based oncopanel for identification of potential targetable markers. Patients & methods: Tumor samples of 45 patients were evaluated using a 12-marker immunohistochemistry panel. The primary end point was the prevalence of potentially actionable markers. Results: At least one expressed marker in each case could be identified. We noted a high prevalence of EGFR (80%, 39/45) and MET (57.4%, 28/45). Three patients received oncopanel-based therapy with variable results. Conclusion: Despite the limited number of treated subjects, oncopanel analysis in end-stage head and neck cancer is operationally and technically feasible. Combination with targeted next generation sequencing might provide additional therapy options.

AB In the recent years, increased understanding of the molecular profiles of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has allowed for targeted treatment of actionable genetic mutations. The management of NSCLC now requires multiple molecular tests to guide the treatment strategy. In the light of this, there is a need to establish a molecular testing consensus statement for advanced NSCLC patients in Malaysia. This Malaysian consensus statement was developed by a panel of experts, chaired by a pathologist and composed of three other pathologists, four respiratory physicians and three oncologists. It reflects currently available scientific data and adaptations of recommendations from international guidelines to the local landscape. Expert recommendations on different aspects of molecular testing agreed upon by the panel are provided as structured discussions. These recommendations address the appropriate patients and samples to be tested, as well as when and how these tests should be performed. The algorithms for molecular testing in metastatic NSCLC, in the first line setting and upon disease progression beyond first line therapy, were developed. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB Primary malignant bone tumors are rare, occur in all age groups, and include distinct entities such as osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. Traditional treatment with some combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation has reached the limit of efficacy, with substantial room for improvement in patient outcome. Furthermore, genomic characterization of these tumors reveals a paucity of actionable molecular targets. Against this backdrop, recent advances in cancer immunotherapy represent a silver lining in the treatment of primary bone cancer. Major strategies in cancer immunotherapy include stimulating naturally occurring anti-tumor T cells and adoptive transfer of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) belong to the latter strategy and are an impressive application of both insights into T cell biology and advances in genetic engineering. In this review, we briefly describe the CAR-T approach and discuss its applications in primary bone tumors. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Few studies assess the utility of rapid multiplex molecular respiratory panels in adult patients. Previous multiplex PCR assays took hours to days from order time to result. We analyze the clinical impact of switching to a molecular assay with a 3-h test-turnaround-time (TAT). We performed a retrospective review of adult patients who presented to our emergency departments with respiratory symptoms and had a respiratory viral panel (xTAG RVP; RVP) or respiratory pathogen panel (ePlex RP; RPP) within 48h of presentation. The average TATs for the RVP and RPP were 27.9 and 3.0h, respectively (P < 0.0001). In RVP-positive and RPP-positive patients, 68.9 and 44.5% of those with normal chest imaging received antibiotics (P = 0.013), while 95.4 and 89.6% of those with abnormal imaging received antibiotics, respectively (P = 0.187). There was no difference in antibiotic duration in RVP-positive and RPP-positive patients with abnormal chest imaging (6.2 and 6.0days, respectively; P = 0.923) and normal chest imaging (4.5 and 4.3days, respectively; P = 0.922). Fewer patients were admitted in the RPP-positive compared to the RVP-positive group (76.9 and 88.6%, respectively; P = 0.013), while the proportion of admissions were similar among RPP-negative and RVP-negative patients (85.3 and 87.1%, P = 0.726). Switching to a multiplex respiratory panel with a clinically actionable TAT is associated with reduced hospital admissions and, in admitted adults without focal radiographic findings, reduced antibiotic initiation. Opportunities to further mitigate inappropriate antibiotic use may be realized by combining rapid multiplex PCR with provider education, clinical decision-care algorithms, and active antibiotic stewardship.

AB Identification of effective targeted therapies for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains an unmet medical need. A patient with platinum-refractory recurrent oral cavity HNSCC underwent comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) that identified an activating MET mutation (R1004). The patient was treated with the oral MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib with rapid response to treatment.Based on this index case, we determined the frequency of MET alterations in 1,637 HNSCC samples, which had been analyzed with hybrid capture-based CGP performed in the routine course of clinical care. The specimens were sequenced to a median depth of >500* for all coding exons from 182 (version 1, n = 24), 236 (version 2, n = 326), or 315 (version 3, n = 1,287) cancer-related genes, plus select introns from 14 (version 1), 19 (version 2), or 28 (version 3) genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We identified 13 HNSCC cases (0.79%) with MET alterations (4 point mutation events and 9 focal amplification events). MET-mutant or amplified tumors represent a small but potentially actionable molecular subset of HNSCC. KEY POINTS: This case report is believed to be the first reported pan-cancer case of a patient harboring a MET mutation at R1004 demonstrating a clinical response to crizotinib, in addition to the first documented case of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with any MET alteration responding to crizotinib.The positive response to MET inhibition in this patient highlights the significance of comprehensive genomic profiling in advanced metastatic HNSCC to identify actionable targetable molecular alterations as current treatment options are limited. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent complication that diminishes patient experience and incurs substantial costs. The purpose of this project was to develop a urinary tract care assessment tool that would lead to actionable quality improvement initiatives.; METHODS: Multidisciplinary teams at a single institution developed the S.T.O.P. UTI algorithm to assess elements related to urinary catheter care: Sterile catheter placement, Timely catheter removal, Optimal collection bag position, and Proper urine sampling for urinalysis and culture. Based on this evaluation, a targeted intervention was applied to address deficient areas in surgical patients. UTI rates were monitored.; RESULTS: The assessment revealed that best practice for sterile placement was being performed but that time to removal, optimal positioning, and proper sampling could be improved. Providers were educated on best practice for catheter removal, nurses placed a reminder note on the chart, personnel were taught about optimal catheter positioning, and nursing assistants were educated on best practices for collection of urine. From 2012 to 2015, non-risk-adjusted UTI rates in surgical patients decreased from 2.90% to 0.46% (p = 0.0003), and the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program risk-adjusted comparison improved from the 8th to the 4th decile. Simultaneously, hospitalwide catheter-associated UTI rates also decreased, from 2.24/1,000 catheter-days in 2014 to 0.70/1,000 catheter-days in 2016 (p < 0.001).; CONCLUSION: The S.T.O.P. UTI algorithm is a tool that hospitals can use to systematically assess UTI processes. The program can identify areas for improvement specific to an institution, directing the allocation of quality improvement resources to decrease both surgical and medical UTIs.

AB OBJECTIVE: The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute launched and evaluated a personalized online program leveraging behavioral science principles to help people self-manage physical and emotional symptoms, improve communication skills, and lead healthier lives during and after a cancer diagnosis.; METHODS: Cancer survivors were recruited from an academic medical and a community clinical setting (N = 40) to complete in-person user testing of the Springboard Beyond Cancer website, which included action decks and content to promote self-management. Action decks were printable or savable collections of information and action steps related to a cancer topic or treatment side effect. Participants performed structured tasks to evaluate the program's content and usability. Comments and reactions were recorded, and qualitative thematic analyses were conducted.; RESULTS: Most participants successfully found information about fatigue (95%), pain (83%), sexual side effects (90%), and support groups (85%). Survivors, particularly those in treatment, found information on the site to be clear, concise, and meeting their needs. Use of action decks to create self-management plans was inconsistent. Survivors reported needing more instruction and support within the program on how to best utilize enhanced functionality in action decks to prioritize their most pressing concerns.; CONCLUSIONS: Early stakeholder engagement throughout the multiple phases of prototyping and deployment are needed to fully maximize end user engagement. Providing actionable self-management content and activating tools to cancer survivors via an eHealth program is a feasible and scalable approach to increasing access to self-management tools and addressing cancer survivor needs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this consensus guideline is to outline recommendations for genetic testing that medical professionals can use to assess hereditary risk for breast cancer.; METHODS: Literature review included large datasets, basic and clinical science publications, and recent updated national guidelines. Genetic testing to assess hereditary risk of cancer is a complex, broad, and dynamic area of medical research. The dominant focus of this guideline is limited in scope to breast cancer.; RESULTS: There is a lack of consensus among experts regarding which genes among many should be tested in different clinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the understanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in many genes.; CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer. Recent data are reviewed that support genetic testing being offered to each patient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic testing is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with other genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local treatment recommendations. Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. Genetic testing should be made available to patients without a history of breast cancer who meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Finally, variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable and these patients should be managed based on their individual risk factors.

AB BACKGROUND: More than 20% of patients undergoing initial breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for cancer require reoperation. To address this concern, the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) endorsed 10 processes of care (tools) in 2015 to be considered by surgeons to de-escalate reoperations. In a planned follow-up, we sought to determine which tools were associated with fewer reoperations.; METHODS: A cohort of ASBrS member surgeons prospectively entered data into the ASBrS Mastery registry on consecutive patients undergoing BCS in 2017. The association between tools and reoperations was estimated via multivariate and hierarchical ranking analyses.; RESULTS: Seventy-one surgeons reported reoperations in 486 (12.3%) of 3954 cases (mean 12.7% [standard deviation (SD) 7.7%], median 11.5% [range 0-32%]). There was an eightfold difference between surgeons in the 10th and 90th percentile performance groups. Actionable factors associated with fewer reoperations included routine planned cavity side-wall shaves, surgeon use of ultrasound (US), neoadjuvant chemotherapy, intra-operative pathologic margin assessment, and use of a pre-operative diagnostic imaging modality beyond conventional 2D mammography. For patients with invasive cancer,≥24% of those who underwent reexcision did so for reported margins of <1 or 2mm, representing noncompliance with the SSO-ASTRO margin guideline.; CONCLUSIONS: Although ASBrS member surgeons had some of the lowest rates of reoperation reported in any registry, significant intersurgeon variability persisted. Further efforts to lower rates are therefore warranted. Opportunities to do so were identified by adopting those processes of care, including improved compliance with the SSO-ASTRO margin guideline, which were associated with fewer reoperations.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: While liquid biopsy is still relatively a new concept, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has recently generated a revolution in the field and will be the focus of this review.; RECENT FINDINGS: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) derives from tumor cells and provides information about the genetic alterations of tumors. However, ctDNA concentration in plasma can be below the level of detection by conventional methods; therefore, screening for actionable genetic information is challenging. Clinical trials exploring targeted and untargeted sequencing to improve the outcomes of ctDNA detection are showing promising results, having reached a limit of detection as low as 0.001% of ctDNA in a background of normal circulating DNA. Most of the challenges related to the sensitivity of detection of ctDNA have been defeated by dint of NGS-based approaches. Despite all the efforts, these methods are still expensive, time-consuming, and require advanced skills for appropriate interpretation. Nevertheless, the technology is rapidly improving, and the expectations for the implementation of liquid biopsy into the clinical practice in the near future are high.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers types among men. Development and progression of PCa is associated with aberrant expression of oncogenic splicing-variants (eg, AR-v7), suggesting that dysregulation of the splicing process might represent a potential actionable target for PCa. Expression levels (mRNA and protein) of SF3B1, one of the main components of the splicing machinery, were analyzed in different cohorts of PCa patients (clinically localized [n = 84], highly aggressive PCa [n = 42], and TCGA dataset [n = 497]). Functional and mechanistic assays were performed in response to pladienolide-B in nontumor and tumor-derived prostate cells. Our results revealed that SF3B1 was overexpressed in PCa tissues and its levels were associated with clinically relevant PCa-aggressive features (eg, metastasis/AR-v7 expression). Moreover, inhibition of SF3B1 activity by pladienolide-B reduced functional parameters of aggressiveness (proliferation/migration/tumorspheres-formation/apoptosis) in PCa cell lines, irrespective of AR-v7 expression, and reduced viability of primary PCa cells. Antitumor actions of pladienolide-B involved: (1) inhibition of PI3K/AKT and JNK signaling pathways, (2) modulation of tumor markers and splicing variants (AR-v7/In1-ghrelin), and (3) regulation of key components of mRNA homeostasis-associated machineries (spliceosome/SURF/EJC). Altogether, our results demonstrated that SF3B1 is overexpressed and associated with malignant features in PCa, and its inhibition reduces PCa aggressiveness, suggesting that SF3B1 could represent a novel prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in PCa.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study sought to determine availability and use of structured override reasons for drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts in electronic health records.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data on DDI alerts and override reasons from 10 clinical sites across the United States using a variety of electronic health records. We used a multistage iterative card sort method to categorize the override reasons from all sites and identified best practices.; RESULTS: Our methodology established 177 unique override reasons across the 10 sites. The number of coded override reasons at each site ranged from 3 to 100. Many sites offered override reasons not relevant to DDIs. Twelve categories of override reasons were identified. Three categories accounted for 78% of all overrides: "will monitor or take precautions," "not clinically significant," and "benefit outweighs risk."; DISCUSSION: We found wide variability in override reasons between sites and many opportunities to improve alerts. Some override reasons were irrelevant to DDIs. Many override reasons attested to a future action (eg, decreasing a dose or ordering monitoring tests), which requires an additional step after the alert is overridden, unless the alert is made actionable. Some override reasons deferred to another party, although override reasons often are not visible to other users. Many override reasons stated that the alert was inaccurate, suggesting that specificity of alerts could be improved.; CONCLUSIONS: Organizations should improve the options available to providers who choose to override DDI alerts.

AB Molecular profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising noninvasive tool. Here, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of blood-derived ctDNA was performed in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We investigated ctDNA-derived genomic alterations, including potential actionability, concordance with tissue NGS, and serial dynamics in 78 patients with colorectal cancer using a clinical-grade NGS assay that detects single nucleotide variants (54-73 genes) and selected copy-number variants, fusions, and indels. Overall, 63 patients [80.8% (63/78)] harbored ctDNA alterations; 59 [75.6% (59/78)], ≥1 characterized alteration (variants of unknown significance excluded). All 59 patients had actionable alterations potentially targetable with FDA-approved drugs [on-label and/or off-label (N = 54) or with experimental drugs in clinical trials (additional five patients); University of California San Diego Molecular Tumor Board assessment]: 45, by OncoKB (http://oncokb.org/#/). The tissue and blood concordance rates for common specific alterations ranged from 62.3% to 86.9% (median = 5 months between tests). In serial samples from patients on anti-EGFR therapy, multiple emerging alterations in genes known to be involved in therapeutic resistance, including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, and MET were detected. In conclusion, over 80% of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer had detectable ctDNA, and the majority had potentially actionable alterations. Concordance between tissue and blood was between 62% and 87%, despite a median of 5 months between tests. Resistance alterations emerged on anti-EGFR therapy. Therefore, biopsy-free, noninvasive ctDNA analysis provides data relevant to the clinical setting. Importantly, sequential ctDNA analysis detects patterns of emerging resistance allowing for precision planning of future therapy. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Access to active search for actionable secondary findings (SF) in diagnostic practice is a major psychological and ethical issue for genomic medicine. In this study, we analyzed the preferences of patients and their families regarding SF and identified the reporting procedures necessary for informed consent. We interviewed parents of patients with undiagnosed rare diseases potentially eligible for exome sequencing and patients affected by the diseases listed in the ACMG recommendations. Four focus groups (FG) were formed: parents of patients with undiagnosed rare diseases (FG1, n = 5); patients with hereditary cancers (FG2, n = 10); patients with hereditary cardiac conditions (FG3, n = 3); and patients with metabolic diseases (FG4, n = 3). Psychologists presented three broad topics for discussion: 1. Favorable or not to SF access, 2. Reporting procedures, 3. Equity of access. Discussions were recorded and analyzed using simplified Grounded Theory. Overall, 8 participants declared being favorable to SF because of the medical benefit (mainly FG1); 11 were unfavorable because of the psychological consequences (mainly FG2, FG3, FG4); 2 were ambivalent. The possibility of looking for SF in minors was debated. The 4 key information-based issues for participants ranked as follows: explanation of SF issues, autonomy of choice, importance of a reflection period, and quality of interactions between patients and professionals. Examining equity of access to SF led to philosophical discussions on quality of life. In conclusion, individual experience and life context (circumstances) were decisive in participants' expectations and fears regarding access to SF. Additional longitudinal studies based on actual SF disclosure announcements are needed to establish future guidelines. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB INTRODUCTION: The number of patients who may benefit from evaluation for face transplantation in the United States (US) remains largely unknown. The goal of our study was to better delineate the pool of patients who might benefit from face transplant evaluation based on the characteristics and mechanisms of injury of previously reported face transplant recipients.; METHODS: The authors utilized data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program in this study. The US Census Bureau data were used for population estimates. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined based on the characteristics of face transplant recipients to date, and the mechanisms of injury they sustained ultimately necessitating face transplantation. Statistical significance was reached if P <0.05.; RESULTS: The estimated annual incidence of preventable craniofacial injuries from firearms (44,266-58,299; 31.7% increase), burns (5712-19,433; 240.2% increase), and animal attacks (5355-14,666; 173.9% increase) increased from 2005 to 2014, whereas the estimated annual incidence of craniofacial injuries from machinery (3927-2933; 25.3% decrease) decreased between 2005 and 2014. The authors estimate the annual incidence rate to fall between 32.1 per 100,000 and 58.1 per 100,000 among individuals aged 20 to 64 in the US.; CONCLUSION: In this study, the authors estimate the annual incidence rate of individuals aged 20 to 64 in the US who may benefit from face transplant evaluation and believe that this quantification has the potential to initiate actionable discussions regarding geographical and financial factors affecting access to care in this patient population.

AB BACKGROUND: Most Americans consult the Internet to address their health concerns. Limited health literacy among the public highlights the need for patient education Web sites to deliver understandable health information. We assessed the understandability and actionability of online neurosurgical patient education materials (PEMs) provided by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and MedlinePlus.; METHODS: Articles on neurosurgical conditions and treatments listed on both the AANS site and MedlinePlus were analyzed. Two reviewers scored articles using 2 validated health literacy tools, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Clear Communication Index (CCI) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). These tools evaluate the quality of written health information and assess for content, organization, and actionability of PEMs.; RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight articles were evaluated from the AANS (n= 61) and MedlinePlus (n=77). The median CCI score for MedlinePlus and AANS articles was 68.9 (interquartile range [IQR], 62.5-81.3) and 56.3 [IQR, 46.7-73.7], respectively (P < 0.001). Only 1 article scored ≥90%, which is the CCI threshold for PEMs to be considered easy to read. Although the AANS and Medline performed similarly on the understandability component of the PEMAT (66.7 [IQR, 53.8-69.2] vs. 69.2 [IQR, 66.7-83.3], respectively; P < 0.001), significant differences were observed for the actionability section of the PEMAT (Medline 60 [IQR, 60-60] vs. AANS 0 [IQR, 0-60]; P < 0.001). Less than 13% of articles provided summaries, visual aids, and tangible tools to aid patient action.; CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical online PEMs may be difficult to understand and potentially act as barriers for patients' engagement with health systems. There is a need to deliver patient-centered health information that effectively informs patients, aiding in meaningful health decision making. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is increasingly appreciated that U1 snRNP transcriptomically suppresses the usage of intronic polyadenylation site (PAS) of mRNAs, an outstanding question is why frequently used PASs are not suppressed. Here we found that U1 snRNP could be transiently associated with sequences upstream of actionable PASs in human cells, and RNA-RNA interaction might contribute to the association. By focusing on individual PAS, we showed that the stable assembly of U1 snRNP near PAS might be generally required for U1 inhibition of mRNA 3' processing. Therefore, actionable PASs that often lack optimal U1 snRNP docking site nearby is free from U1 inhibitory effect. Consistently, natural 5' splicing site (5'-SS) is moderately enriched ~250 nt upstream of intronic PASs whose usage is sensitive to functional knockdown of U1 snRNA. Collectively, our results provided an insight into how U1 snRNP selectively inhibits the usage of PASs in a cellular context, and supported a prevailing model that U1 snRNP scans pre-mRNA through RNA-RNA interaction to find a stable interaction site to exercise its function in pre-mRNA processing, including repressing the usage of cryptic PASs.

AB Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer following invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). To identify potential genetic drivers of ILC progression, we used NanoString nCounter technology to investigate the DNA copy number (CN) in 70 well-curated primary ILC samples. We confirmed prior observations of frequent amplification of CCND1 (33%), and MYC (17%) in ILC, but additionally identified a substantial subset of ILCs with ESR1 and ERBB2 (19%) amplifications. Of interest, tumors with ESR1 CN gains (14%) and amplification (10%) were more likely to recur compared to those with normal CN. Finally, we observed that MDM4 (MDMX) was amplified in 17% of ILC samples. MDM4 knockdown in TP53 wild-type ILC cell lines caused increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation associated with cell cycle arrest, and concomitant activation of TP53 target genes. Similar effects were seen in TP53 mutant cells, indicting a TP53-independent role for MDM4 in ILC. To conclude, amplification of ESR1 and MDM4 are potential genetic drivers of ILC. These amplifications may represent actionable, targetable tumor dependencies, and thus have potential clinical implications and warrant further study. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Radiotherapy is cytotoxic to tumor cells and is therefore a critical component of therapy for many malignancies, including glioblastoma (GBM). We now appreciate the value of the immunomodulatory effects of radiation that may be important to overall therapeutic success in some patients with this primary brain tumor. Although potentially beneficial immune-stimulating properties of radiotherapy treatment have been the focus of recent study, this modality is actually at the same time associated with the depletion of lymphocytes, which are crucial to the defense against neoplastic development and progression. In this review, we describe the association of systemic lymphopenia with poor tumor outcome, present evidence that radiotherapy is an important contributing cause of lymphodepletion, describe the systemic immune context of tumor and brain injury that contributes to immunosuppression, describe other contributing factors to lymphopenia including concomitant medications and treatments, and speculate about the role of the normal physiologic response to brain injury in the immunosuppressive dynamics of GBM. Radiotherapy is one significant and potentially actionable iatrogenic suppressor of immune response that may be limiting the success of therapy in GBM and other tumor types. Altered strategies for radiotherapy more permissive of a vigorous antineoplastic immune response may improve outcome for malignancy. Copyright © 2019 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

AB Despite the nationwide availability of pharmacogenomic (PGx) guidelines in electronic medication surveillance systems in The Netherlands, PGx guided prescribing is still uncommon in primary care. We set out to investigate the adoption of pharmacist initiated PGx testing in primary care. Community pharmacists were offered a free PGx test covering 40 variants in 8 genes to test patients receiving an incident prescription (IRx) of a selection of 10 drugs. Results of the PGx test along with predicted phenotypes and a therapeutic recommendation based on the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guidelines were transferred to the pharmacist and physician. Adoption was defined as the percentage of eligible patients that received genotyping. From November 2014-July 2016, 200 patients were included with an adoption of 18.0%. Of the included patients 57.5% received an IRx for atorvastatin, 14.5% started with simvastatin and 28.0% received an IRx for amitriptyline, (es)citalopram, nortriptyline, or venlafaxine. 90% of the patients carried at least one actionable PGx test result in the selected PGx-panel. In 31.0% of the incident prescriptions a combination between a drug with a known gene-drug interaction and an actionable genotype was present and a therapeutic recommendation was provided. The provided recommendations were accepted by the clinicians in 88.7% of the patients. Pharmacist initiated implementation of PGx in primary care is feasible, and the frequency of actionable gene-drug interactions for the selected drugs is high.

AB Mechanical ventilation alarms and alerts, both audible and visual, provide the clinician with vital information about the patient's physiologic condition and the status of the machine's function. Not all alarms generated by the mechanical ventilator provide actionable information. Over time, clinicians can become desensitized to audible alarms due to alarm fatigue and may potentially ignore an actionable situation that results in patient harm. Alarm fatigue has been recognized by multiple agencies as a major patient-safety issue. To date, mechanical ventilator alarm settings do not have standardized nomenclature. The aim of this review was to examine and report on the literature that pertains to mechanical ventilation alarms and alarm fatigue and to propose recommendations for future research that may lead to safer mechanical ventilation alarm practices.

AB The treatment of cancer continues to evolve toward personalized therapies based on individual patient and tumor characteristics. Our successes and failures in adopting a precision-oncology approach have demonstrated the utmost importance in identifying the proper predictive biomarkers of response. Until recently, most biomarkers were identified using immunohistochemistry for protein expression or single-gene analysis to identify targetable alterations. With the rapid propagation of next-generation sequencing to evaluate tumor tissue and "liquid biopsies," identification of genomic biomarkers is now standard, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, for which there is now an extensive catalog of biomarker-directed therapies with more anticipated to come. Despite these great strides, it has also become apparent that using genomic biomarkers alone will be insufficient, as it has been consistently shown that at least one-half of patients who undergo tumor genomic profiling have no actionable alteration. This is perhaps to be expected given the remarkable breadth of nongenetic factors that contribute to tumor initiation and progression. Some have proposed that the next logical step is to use transcriptome profiling to define new biomarkers of response to targeted agents. Recently, results from the WINTHER trial were published, specifically investigating the use of transcriptomics to improve match rates over genomic next-generation sequencing alone. In this review, we discuss the complexities of precision-oncology efforts and appraise the available evidence supporting the incorporation of transcriptomic data into the precision-oncology framework in the historical context of the development of biomarkers for directing cancer therapy. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Descriptive and translational investigations into the human gut microbiome (GM) are rapidly expanding; however, studies are largely restricted to industrialized populations in the USA and Europe. Little is known about microbial variability and its implications for health and disease in other parts of the world. Populations in Africa are particularly underrepresented. What limited research has been performed has focused on a few subject domains, including the impact of long-term lifestyle and dietary factors on GM ecology, its maturation during infancy, and the interrelationships between the microbiome, infectious disease, and undernutrition. Recently, international consortia have laid the groundwork for large-scale genomics and microbiome studies on the continent, with a particular interest in the epidemiologic transition to noncommunicable disease. Here, we survey the current landscape of GM scholarship in Africa and propose actionable recommendations to improve research capacity and output. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pre-emptive pharmacogenetics (PGx) testing of a panel of germline genetic variants represents a new model for personalized medicine. Clinical impact of PGx testing is maximized when all variant alleles for which actionable clinical guidelines are available are included in the test panel. However, no such standardized panel has been presented to date, impeding adoption, exchange, and continuity of PGx testing. We, therefore, developed such a panel, hereafter called the PGx-Passport, based on the actionable Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guidelines. Germline-variant alleles were systematically selected using predefined criteria regarding allele population frequencies, effect on protein functionality, and association with drug response. A PGx-Passport of 58 germline variant alleles, located within 14 genes (CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, DPYD, F5, HLA-A, HLA-B, NUDT15, SLCO1B1, TPMT, UGT1A1, and VKORC1) was composed. This PGx-Passport can be used in combination with the DPWG guidelines to optimize drug prescribing for 49 commonly prescribed drugs. © 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB AIMS: To discern the differences in expression profiling of two histological subtypes of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arising from the serrated route (serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC) and CRC showing histological and molecular features of a high level of microsatellite instability (hmMSI-H) both sharing common features (female gender, right-sided location, mucinous histology, and altered CpG methylation), but dramatically differing in terms of prognosis, development of an immune response, and treatment options.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Molecular signatures of SAC and hmMSI-H were obtained by the use of transcriptomic arrays; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to validate differentially expressed genes. An over-representation of innate immunity functions (granulomonocytic recruitment, chemokine production, Toll-like receptor signalling, and antigen processing and presentation) was obtained from this comparison, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) was more highly expressed in hmMSI-H, whereas two genes [those encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide-receptor component protein and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14)] were more highly expressed in SAC. These array results were subsequently validated by qPCR, and by IHC for CXCL14 and ICAM1. Information retrieved from public databanks confirmed our findings.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight specific functions and genes that provide a better understanding of the role of the immune response in the serrated pathological route and may be of help in identifying actionable molecules. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: HER2 amplification is detected in 3% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), making tumors in the metastatic setting vulnerable to double pharmacological HER2 blockade. Preclinical findings show that it also might impair response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic CRC underwent molecular screening of HER2 positivity by HERACLES criteria (immunohistochemistry 3+ or 2+ in ≥50% of cells, confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization). A sample of consecutive HER2-negative patients was selected as control. A regression modeling strategy was applied to identify predictors explaining the bulk of HER2 positivity and the association with response to previous anti-EGFR treatment.; RESULTS: From August 2012 to April 2018, a total of 100 HER2-positive metastatic CRC tumors were detected out of 1,485 KRAS exon 2 wild-type screened patients (6.7%). HER2-positive patients show more frequently lung metastases (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-3.61; p = .014) and higher tumor burden (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-2.01; p = .011), and tumors were more likely to be left sided (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.22-1.11; p = .088). HER2-positive patients who received treatment with anti-EGFR agents (n = 79) showed poorer outcome (objective response rate, 31.2% vs. 46.9%, p = .031; progression-free survival, 5.7 months vs. 7 months, p = .087).; CONCLUSION: Testing for HER2 should be offered to all patients with metastatic CRC because the occurrence of this biomarker is unlikely to be predicted based on main clinicopathological features. Patients with HER2-amplified metastatic CRC are less likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients with HER2-amplified/overexpressed metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) harbor a driver actionable molecular alteration that has been shown in preclinical models to hamper efficacy of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapies. The present study confirmed that this molecular feature was associated with worse objective tumor response and shorter progression-free survival in response to previous anti-EGFR therapies. Moreover, it was found that the occurrence of this biomarker is unlikely to be predicted based on main clinicopathological features. Therefore, HER2 status assessment should be included in the molecular diagnostic workup of all mCRC for speedy referral to clinical trials encompassing HER2-targeted double blockade independently of previous anti-EGFR treatment. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive salivary gland malignancy without effective systemic therapies. Delineation of molecular profiles in ACC has led to an increased number of biomarker-stratified clinical trials; however, the clinical utility and U.S.-centric financial sustainability of integrated next-generation sequencing (NGS) in routine practice has, to our knowledge, not been assessed.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our practice, NGS genotyping was implemented at the discretion of the primary clinician. We combined NGS-based mutation and fusion detection, with MYB break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and MYB immunohistochemistry. Utility was defined as the fraction of patients with tumors harboring alterations that are potentially amenable to targeted therapies. Financial sustainability was assessed using the fraction of global reimbursement.; RESULTS: Among 181 consecutive ACC cases (2011-2018), prospective genotyping was performed in 11% (n = 20/181; n = 8 nonresectable). Testing identified 5/20 (25%) NOTCH1 aberrations, 6/20 (30%) MYB-NFIB fusions (all confirmed by FISH), and 2/20 (10%) MYBL1-NFIB fusions. Overall, these three alterations (MYB/MYBL1/NOTCH1) made up 65% of patients, and this subset had a more aggressive course with significantly shorter progression-free survival. In 75% (n = 6/8) of nonresectable patients, we detected potentially actionable alterations. Financial analysis of the global charges, including NGS codes, indicated 63% reimbursement, which is in line with national (U.S.-based) and international levels of reimbursement.; CONCLUSION: Prospective routine clinical genotyping in ACC can identify clinically relevant subsets of patients and is approaching financial sustainability. Demonstrating clinical utility and financial sustainability in an orphan disease (ACC) requires a multiyear and multidimensional program.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Delineation of molecular profiles in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been accomplished in the research setting; however, the ability to identify relevant patient subsets in clinical practice has not been assessed. This work presents an approach to perform integrated molecular genotyping of patients with ACC with nonresectable, recurrent, or systemic disease. It was determined that 75% of nonresectable patients harbor potentially actionable alterations and that 63% of charges are reimbursed. This report outlines that orphan diseases such as ACC require a multiyear, multidimensional program to demonstrate utility in clinical practice. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB Purpose: Radiotherapy prescription dose and dose fractionation protocols vary little between individual patients having the same tumor grade and stage. To personalize radiotherapy a predictive model is needed to simulate radiation response. Previous modeling attempts with multiple variables and parameters have been shown to yield excellent data fits at the cost of non-identifiability and clinically unrealistic results. Materials and methods: We develop a mathematical model based on a proliferation saturation index (PSI) that is a measurement of pre-treatment tumor volume-to-carrying capacity ratio that modulates intrinsic tumor growth and radiation response rates. In an adaptive Bayesian approach, we utilize an increasing number of data points for individual patients to predict patient-specific responses to subsequent radiation doses. Results: Model analysis shows that using PSI as the only patient-specific parameter, model simulations can fit longitudinal clinical data with high accuracy (R2=0.84). By analyzing tumor response to radiation using daily CT scans early in the treatment, response to the remaining treatment fractions can be predicted after two weeks with high accuracy (c-index = 0.89). Conclusion: The PSI model may be suited to forecast treatment response for individual patients and offers actionable decision points for mid-treatment protocol adaptation. The presented work provides an actionable image-derived biomarker prior to and during therapy to personalize and adapt radiotherapy.

AB The term 'liquid biopsy', introduced in 2013 in reference to the analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in cancer patients, was extended to cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) circulating in blood and other body fluids. CTCs and cfNAs are now considered diagnostic and prognostic markers, used as surrogate materials for the molecular characterisation of solid tumours, in particular for research on tumour-specific or actionable somatic mutations. Molecular characterisation of cfNAs and CTCs (especially at the single cell level) is technically challenging, requiring highly sensitive and specific methods and/or multi-step processes. The analysis of the liquid biopsy relies on a plethora of methods whose standardisation cannot be accomplished without disclosing criticisms related to the pre-analytical phase. Thus, pre-analytical factors potentially influencing downstream cellular and molecular analyses must be considered in order to translate the liquid biopsy approach into clinical practice. The present review summarises the most recent reports in this field, discussing the main pre-analytical aspects related to CTCs, cfNAs and exosomes in blood samples for liquid biopsy analysis. A short discussion on non-blood liquid biopsy samples is also included. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Studies of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED) show a relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) duration and stroke risk, though the interaction with CHA2DS2-VASc score is poorly defined. The objective of this study is to evaluate rates of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) in CIED patients as a function of both CHA2DS2-VASc score and AF duration. Methods: Data from the Optum© electronic health record (EHR) de-identified database (2007-2017) were linked to the Medtronic CareLinkTM database of CIEDs capable of continuous AF monitoring. An index date was assigned as the later of 6 months after device implant or 1 year after EHR data availability. CHA2DS2-VASc score was assessed via EHR data prior to the index date. Maximum daily AF burden (No AF, 6 minutes-23.5 hours, and >23.5 hours) was assessed over the 6 months prior to index date. SSE rates were computed post-index date. Results: Among 21,768 non-anticoagulated CIED patients (68.6±12.7 years, 63% male), increasing AF duration (p<0.001) and increasing CHA2DS2-VASc score (p<0.001) were both significantly associated with annualized risk of SSE. SSE rates were low in CHA2DS2-VASc 0-1 patients regardless of device-detected AF duration. However, stroke risk crossed an actionable threshold defined as >1%/year in CHA2DS2-VASc 2 patients with >23.5 hours of AF, CHA2DS2-VASc 3-4 patients with >6 minutes of AF, and in CHA2DS2-VASc ≥5 patients even with no AF. Conclusions: There is an interaction between AF duration and CHA2DS2-VASc score which can further risk stratify AF patients for SSE and may be useful in guiding anticoagulation therapy.

AB The large-scale genetic profiling of tumours can identify potentially actionable molecular variants for which approved anticancer drugs are available1-3. However, when patients with such variants are treated with drugs outside of their approved label, successes and failures of targeted therapy are not systematically collected or shared. We therefore initiated the Drug Rediscovery protocol, an adaptive, precision-oncology trial that aims to identify signals of activity in cohorts of patients, with defined tumour types and molecular variants, who are being treated with anticancer drugs outside of their approved label. To be eligible for the trial, patients have to have exhausted or declined standard therapies, and have malignancies with potentially actionable variants for which no approved anticancer drugs are available. Here we show an overall rate of clinical benefit-defined as complete or partial response, or as stable disease beyond 16weeks-of 34% in 215treated patients, comprising 136patients who received targeted therapies and 79patients who received immunotherapy. The overall median duration of clinical benefit was 9months (95% confidence interval of 8-11months), including 26patients who were experiencing ongoing clinical benefit at data cut-off. The potential of the Drug Rediscovery protocol is illustrated by the identification of a successful cohort of patients with microsatellite instable tumours who received nivolumab (clinical benefit rate of 63%), and a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer with relatively low mutational load who experienced only limited clinical benefit from immunotherapy. The Drug Rediscovery protocol facilitates the defined use of approved drugs beyond their labels in rare subgroups of cancer, identifies early signals of activity in these subgroups, accelerates the clinical translation of new insights into the use of anticancer drugs outside of their approved label, and creates a publicly available repository of knowledge for future decision-making.

AB Whilst adequate for most existing pathological tests, formalin is generally considered a poor DNA preservative and use of alternative fixatives may prove advantageous for molecular testing of tumour material; an increasingly common approach to identify targetable driver mutations in lung cancer patients. We collected paired PAXgene tissue-fixed and formalin-fixed samples of block-sized tumour and lung parenchyma, Temno-needle core tumour biopsies and fine needle tumour aspirates (FNAs) from non-small cell lung cancer resection specimens. Traditionally processed formalin fixed paraffin wax embedded (FFPE) samples were compared to paired PAXgene tissue fixed paraffin-embedded (PFPE) samples. We evaluated suitability for common laboratory tests (H&E staining and immunohistochemistry) and performance for downstream molecular investigations relevant to lung cancer, including RT-PCR and next generation DNA sequencing (NGS). Adequate and comparable H&E staining was seen in all sample types and nuclear staining was preferable in PAXgene fixed Temno tumour biopsies and tumour FNA samples. Immunohistochemical staining was broadly comparable. PFPE samples enabled greater yields of less-fragmented DNA than FFPE comparators. PFPE samples were also superior for PCR and NGS performance, both in terms of quality control metrics and for variant calling. Critically we identified a greater number of genetic variants in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene when using PFPE samples and the Ingenuity Variant Analysis pipeline. In summary, PFPE samples are adequate for histopathological diagnosis and suitable for the majority of existing laboratory tests. PAXgene fixation is superior for DNA and RNA integrity, particularly in low-yield samples and facilitates improved NGS performance, including the detection of actionable lung cancer mutations for precision medicine in lung cancer samples. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Disease emergence events, epidemics and pandemics all underscore the need to predict zoonotic pathogen spillover. Because cross-species transmission is inherently hierarchical, involving processes that occur at varying levels of biological organization, such predictive efforts can be complicated by the many scales and vastness of data potentially required for forecasting. A wide range of approaches are currently used to forecast spillover risk (e.g. macroecology, pathogen discovery, surveillance of human populations, among others), each of which is bound within particular phylogenetic, spatial and temporal scales of prediction. Here, we contextualize these diverse approaches within their forecasting goals and resulting scales of prediction to illustrate critical areas of conceptual and pragmatic overlap. Specifically, we focus on an ecological perspective to envision a research pipeline that connects these different scales of data and predictions from the aims of discovery to intervention. Pathogen discovery and predictions focused at the phylogenetic scale can first provide coarse and pattern-based guidance for which reservoirs, vectors and pathogens are likely to be involved in spillover, thereby narrowing surveillance targets and where such efforts should be conducted. Next, these predictions can be followed with ecologically driven spatio-temporal studies of reservoirs and vectors to quantify spatio-temporal fluctuations in infection and to mechanistically understand how pathogens circulate and are transmitted to humans. This approach can also help identify general regions and periods for which spillover is most likely. We illustrate this point by highlighting several case studies where long-term, ecologically focused studies (e.g. Lyme disease in the northeast USA, Hendra virus in eastern Australia, Plasmodium knowlesi in Southeast Asia) have facilitated predicting spillover in space and time and facilitated the design of possible intervention strategies. Such studies can in turn help narrow human surveillance efforts and help refine and improve future large-scale, phylogenetic predictions. We conclude by discussing how greater integration and exchange between data and predictions generated across these varying scales could ultimately help generate more actionable forecasts and interventions. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.

AB Approximately 450 million people, many of whom live in poverty and are from low and middle-income countries (LMICs), experience serious mental health challenges. Children in sub-Saharan Africa comprise half of the total regional population, yet existing mental health services are severely under-equipped to meet their needs and evidence-based practices (EBPs) are scarce. In Uganda, one in five children present mental health challenges, including disruptive behavior disorders. Guided by the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability (PRISM) framework, this paper describes the strategies by which we have engaged community and government partners to invest in a collaborative, longitudinal study in Uganda aimed at improving youth behavioral health outcomes by testing a collaboratively adapted EBP. We emphasize that implementation scientists should be prepared and willing to invest time and effort engaging key stakeholders and sustain relationships through a full range of collaborative activities; ensure that their science meets a felt need among the stakeholders; and translate their research findings rapidly into accessible and actionable policy recommendations. Finally, we highlight that collaboration with global communities and governments plays a critical role in the adaptation, uptake, scalability, and sustainability of EBPs, and that the process of engagement and collaboration can be guided by conceptual frameworks.

AB Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is relatively rare (1 to 2% of pancreatic malignancies) but may be under-recognized. In contrast to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, most acinar cell carcinomas lack mutations in KRAS, DPC, CDKN2A or TP53, but appear to have a high incidence of gene rearrangements, with up to 20% reported to be driven by BRAF fusions. With the development of a new class of RET-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which appear to have particularly strong activity against RET gene rearranged tumours, there is now considerable interest in identifying RET gene rearrangements across a wide range of cancers. RET rearrangements have been reported to occur at a very low incidence (<1%) in all pancreatic carcinomas. We postulated that given its unique molecular profile, RET gene rearrangements may be common in acinar cell carcinomas. We performed fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) studies on a cohort of 40 acinar cell spectrum tumours comprising 36 pure acinar cell carcinomas, three pancreatoblastomas and one mixed acinar-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. RET gene rearrangements were identified in 3 (7.5%) cases and BRAF gene rearrangements in 5 (12.5%). All gene rearranged tumours were pure acinar cell carcinomas. Our findings indicate that amongst all pancreatic carcinomas, acinar carcinomas are highly enriched for potentially actionable gene rearrangements in RET or BRAF. FISH testing is inexpensive and readily available in the routine clinical setting and may have a role in the assessment of all acinar cell carcinomas-at this stage to recruit patients for clinical trials of new targeted therapies, but perhaps in the near future as part of routine care.

AB Despite considerable advances in the management of urothelial carcinoma (UC), better risk stratification and enhanced detection of minimal residual disease are still urgent priorities to prolong survival while avoiding the morbidity of overtreatment. Circulating tumor cells and DNA (CTCs, ctDNA) are two biologically distinct "liquid biopsies" that may potentially address this need, although they have been understudied in UC to date and their relative utility is unknown. To this end, matched CTC and ctDNA samples were collected for a head-to-head comparison in a pilot study of 16 patients with metastatic UC. CTCs were defined as cytokeratin- and/or EpCAM-positive using the RareCyte direct imaging platform. ctDNA was assayed using the PlasmaSelect64 probe-capture assay. 75% of patients had detectable CTCs, and 73% had detectable somatic mutations, with no correlation between CTC count and ctDNA. 91% of patients had tissue confirmation of at least one plasma mutation and, importantly, several clinically actionable mutations were detected in plasma that were not found in the matching tumor. A ctDNA fraction of >2% was significantly associated with worse overall survival (p=0.039) whereas CTC detection was not (p=0.46). Notably, using a predefined gene panel for ctDNA detection had a high but not complete detection rate in metastatic UC, similar to what has been described for a custom tissue-personalized assay approach. In sum, both liquid biopsies show promise in UC and deserve further investigation. PATIENT SUMMARY: New "liquid biopsy" blood tests are emerging for urothelial cancer aimed at early detection and avoiding overtreatment. Our results suggest that two such tests provide complementary information: circulating tumor cells may be best for studying the biological features of a person's cancer, whereas circulating tumor DNA may be better for early detection.

AB Metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance can increase the sensitivity of MRI, though its ability to inform on relevant changes to biochemistry in humans remains unclear. In this work, we image pyruvate metabolism in patients, assessing the reproducibility of delivery and conversion in the setting of primary prostate cancer. We show that the time to max of pyruvate does not vary significantly within patients undergoing two separate injections or across patients. Furthermore, we show that lactate increases with Gleason grade. RNA sequencing data demonstrate a significant increase in the predominant pyruvate uptake transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 1. Increased protein expression was also observed in regions of high lactate signal, implicating it as the driver of lactate signal invivo. Targeted DNA sequencing for actionable mutations revealed the highest lactate occurred in patients with PTEN loss. This work identifies a potential link between actionable genomic alterations and metabolic information derived from hyperpolarized pyruvate MRI. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A barrier to incorporating genomics more broadly is limited access to providers with genomics expertise. Chatbots are a technology-based simulated conversation used in scaling communications. Geisinger and Clear Genetics, Inc. have developed chatbots to facilitate communication with participants receiving clinically actionable genetic variants from the MyCode Community Health Initiative (MyCode ). The consent chatbot walks patients through the consent allowing them to opt to receive more or less detail on key topics (goals, benefits, risks, etc.). The follow-up chatbot reminds participants of suggested actions following result receipt and the cascade chatbot can be sent to at-risk relatives by participants to share their genetic test results and facilitate cascade testing. To explore the acceptability, usability, and understanding of the study consent, post-result follow-up and cascade testing chatbots, we conducted six focus groups with MyCode participants. Sixty-two individuals participated in a focus group (n=33 consent chatbot, n=29 follow-up and cascade chatbot). Participants were mostly female (n=42, 68%), Caucasian (n=58, 94%), college-educated (n=33,53%), retirees (n=38, 61%), and of age 56years or older (n=52, 84%).Few participants reported that they knew what a chatbot was (n=10, 16%), and a small number reported that they had used a chatbot (n=5, 8%). Qualitative analysis of transcripts and notes from focus groups revealed four main themes: (a) overall impressions, (b) suggested improvements, (c) concerns and limitations, and (d) implementation. Participants supported using chatbots to consent for genomics research and to interact with healthcare providers for care coordination following receipt of genomic results. Most expressed willingness to use a chatbot to share genetic information with relatives. The consent chatbot presents an engaging alternative to deliver content challenging to comprehend in traditional paper or in-person consent. The cascade and follow-up chatbots may be acceptable, user-friendly, scalable approaches to manage ancillary genetic counseling tasks. © 2019 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB The International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) lupus nephritis (LN) classification is under reconsideration, given challenges with inter-rater reliability and resultant inconsistent relationship with treatment response. Integration of molecular classifiers into histologic evaluation can improve diagnostic precision and identify therapeutic targets. This study described the relationship between histological and molecular phenotypes and clinical responses in LN. Renal compartmental mRNA abundance was measured in 54 biopsy specimens from LN patients and correlated to ISN/RPS classification and individual histologic lesions. A subset of transcripts was also evaluated in sequential biopsies of a separate longitudinal cohort of 36 patients with paired samples obtained at the time of flare and at follow up. Unsupervised clustering based on mRNA abundance did not demonstrate a relationship with the (ISN/RPS) classification, nor did univariate statistical analysis. Exploratory analyses suggested a correlation with individual histologic lesions. Glomerular FN1 (fibronectin), SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), and LGALS3 (galectin 3) abundance correlated with disease activity and changed following treatment. Exploratory analyses suggested relationships between specific transcripts and individual histologic lesions, with the important representation of interferon-regulated genes. Our findings suggested that the current LN classification could be refined by the inclusion of molecular descriptors. Combining molecular and pathologic kidney biopsy phenotypes may hold promise to better classify disease and identify actionable treatment targets and merits further exploration in larger cohorts.

AB While autophagy is thought to be an essential process in some cancer cells, it is unknown if or how such cancer cells can circumvent autophagy inhibition. To address this, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9 assay with dynamic live-cell imaging to measure acute effects of knockout (KO) of autophagy genes compared to known essential and non-essential genes. In some cancer cells, autophagy is as essential for cancer cell growth as mRNA transcription or translation or DNA replication. However, even these highly autophagy-dependent cancer cells evolve to circumvent loss of autophagy by upregulating NRF2, which is necessary and sufficient for autophagy-dependent cells to circumvent ATG7 KO and maintain protein homeostasis. Importantly, however, this adaptation increases susceptibly to proteasome inhibitors. These studies identify a common mechanism of acquired resistance to autophagy inhibition and show that selection to avoid tumor cell dependency on autophagy creates new, potentially actionable cancer cell susceptibilities.

AB Conceptual scientific and medical advances have led to a recent realization that there may be no single, one-size-fits-all diet and that differential human responses to dietary inputs may rather be driven by unique and quantifiable host and microbiome features. Integration of these person-specific host and microbiome readouts into actionable modules may complement traditional food measurement approaches in devising diets that are of benefit to the individual. Although many host-derived factors are hardwired and difficult to modulate, the microbiome may be more readily reshaped by environmental factors such as dietary exposures and is increasingly recognized to potentially impact human physiology by participating in digestion, the absorption of nutrients, shaping of the mucosal immune response and the synthesis or modulation of a plethora of potentially bioactive compounds. Thus, diet-induced microbiota alterations may be harnessed in order to induce changes in host physiology, including disease development and progression. However, major limitations in 'big-data' processing and analysis still limit our interpretive and translational capabilities concerning these person-specific host, microbiome and diet interactions. In this Review, we describe the latest advances in understanding diet-microbiota interactions, the individuality of gut microbiota composition and how this knowledge could be harnessed for personalized nutrition strategies to improve human health.

AB Tumor heterogeneity, especially intratumoral heterogeneity, is a primary reason for treatment failure. A single biopsy may not reflect the complete genomic architecture of the tumor needed to make therapeutic decisions. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is believed to overcome these limitations. We analyzed concordance between ctDNA and whole-exome sequencing/whole-genome sequencing (WES/WGS) of tumor samples from patients with breast (n = 12), gastrointestinal (n = 20), lung (n = 19), and other tumor types (n = 13). Correlation in the driver, hotspot, and actionable alterations was studied. Three cases in which more-in-depth genomic analysis was required have been presented. A total 58% (37/64) of patients had at least one concordant mutation. Patients who had received systemic therapy before tissue next-generation sequencing (NGS) and ctDNA analysis showed high concordance (78% (21/27) vs. 43% (12/28) p = 0.01, respectively). Obtaining both NGS and ctDNA increased actionable alterations from 28% (18/64) to 52% (33/64) in our patients. Twenty-one patients had mutually exclusive actionable alterations seen only in either tissue NGS or ctDNA samples. Somatic hotspot mutation analysis showed significant discordance between tissue NGS and ctDNA analysis, denoting significant tumor heterogeneity in these malignancies. Increased tissue tumor mutation burden (TMB) positively correlated with the number of ctDNA mutations in patients who had received systemic therapy, but not in treatment-naive patients. Prior systemic therapy and TMB may affect concordance and should be taken into consideration in future studies. Incorporating driver, actionable, and hotspot analysis may help to further refine the correlation between these two platforms. Tissue NGS and ctDNA are complimentary, and if done in conjunction, may increase the detection rate of actionable alterations and potentially therapeutic targets.

AB BACKGROUND: Individual behavior change is a critical ingredient in efforts to improve global health. Central to the focus on behavior has been a growing understanding of how the human brain makes decisions, from motivations and mindsets to unconscious biases and cognitive shortcuts. Recent work in the field of behavioral economics and related fields has contributed to a rich menu of insights and principles that can be engineered into global health programs to increase impact and reach. However, there is little research on the process of designing and testing interventions informed by behavioral insights.; METHODS: In a study focused on increasing household participation in a Chagas disease vector control campaign in Arequipa, Peru, we applied Datta and Mullainathan's "behavioral design" approach to formulate and test specific interventions. In this Technical Advance article we describe the behavioral design approach in detail, including the Define, Diagnosis, Design, and Test phases. We also show how the interventions designed through the behavioral design process were adapted for a pragmatic randomized controlled field trial.; RESULTS: The behavioral design framework provided a systematic methodology for defining the behavior of interest, diagnosing reasons for household reluctance or refusal to participate, designing interventions to address actionable bottlenecks, and then testing those interventions in a rigorous counterfactual context. Behavioral design offered us a broader range of strategies and approaches than are typically used in vectorcontrol campaigns.; CONCLUSIONS: Careful attention to how behavioral design may affect internal and external validity of evaluations and the scalability of interventions is needed going forward. We recommend behavioral design as a useful complement to other intervention design and evaluation approaches in global health programs.

AB Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, making up 10% of all congenital heart defects. Annual follow-up echocardiograms are recommended in patients with repaired ToF, but evidence-based guidelines do not exist. We hypothesized that most echocardiograms performed in asymptomatic patients with repaired ToF and no physical exam change do not result in an actionable change (AC) in management. We retrospectively reviewed records of all patients with ToF and prior complete repair at our institution between January 2000 and September 2015. Changes in echocardiograms resulting in hospital admission, medication addition/change, cardiac catheterization, or surgical procedure were identified via chart review. These changes were referred to as an AC. A total of 1135 echocardiograms were reviewed from 233 patients (160 with initial complete repair, 70 with prior shunt, and 3 with other initial surgery). The median number of echocardiograms per patient was 5. Of the 1135 echocardiograms, 15 (1.3%) were associated with AC. Of the 15 patients with AC echocardiograms, 9 underwent a shunt prior to complete repair (9/70, 12.9%) and 6 had undergone an initial complete repair (6/160, 3.8%). The median age at AC was 6.3years (IQR 4.4, 6.8) in the shunt group and 0.90years (IQR 0.87, 1.1) in the initial complete repair group. In asymptomatic patients with repaired ToF and no physical exam change, echocardiograms rarely lead to a change in clinical management. In conclusion, the likelihood and timing of AC echocardiograms and reinterventions vary based on the type of initial surgery.

AB The majority of biobank policies and consent forms do not address post-mortem use of data for medical research, thus causing uncertainty after research participants' death. This systematic review identifies studies examining stakeholders' perspectives on this issue. We conducted a search in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science. Findings were categorised in two themes: (1) views on the use of data for medical research after participants' death, and (2) perspectives regarding the post-mortem return of individual genetic research results. An important subtheme was the appropriate authority and degree of control over posthumous use of data. The sixteen included studies all focused on genetic data and used quantitative and qualitative methods to survey perspectives of research participants, family members, researchers and Institutional Review Board members. Acceptability of post-mortem use of data for medical research was high among research participants and their relatives. Most stakeholders thought participants should be informed about post-mortem research uses during initial consent. Between lay persons and professionals, disagreement exists about whether relatives should receive actionable genetic findings, and whether the deceased's previous preferences can be overridden. We conclude that regulations and ethical guidance should leave room for post-mortem use of personal data for research, provided that informed consent procedures are transparent on this issue, including the return of individual research findings to relatives. Future research is needed to explore underlying causes for differences in views, as well as ethical and legal issues on the appropriate level of control by deceased research participants (while alive) and their relatives.

AB Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields in smallholder farms is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.

AB PURPOSE: The genomic landscape of gliomas has been characterized and now contributes to disease classification, yet the relationship between molecular profile and disease progression and treatment response remain poorly understood.Experimental Design: We integrated prospective clinical sequencing of 1,004 primary and recurrent tumors from 923 glioma patients with clinical and treatment phenotypes.; RESULTS: Thirteen percent of glioma patients harbored a pathogenic germline variant, including a subset associated with heritable genetic syndromes and variants mediating DNA repair dysfunctions (29% of the total) that were associated with somatic biallelic inactivation and mechanism-specific somatic phenotypes. In astrocytomas, genomic alterations in effectors of cell-cycle progression correlated with aggressive disease independent of IDH mutation status, arose preferentially in enhancing tumors (44% vs. 8%, P < 0.001), were associated with rapid disease progression following tumor recurrence (HR = 2.6, P = 0.02), and likely preceded the acquisition of alkylating therapy-associated somatic hypermutation. Thirty-two percent of patients harbored a potentially therapeutically actionable lesion, of whom 11% received targeted therapies. In BRAF-mutant gliomas, response to agents targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis was influenced by the type of mutation, its clonality, and its cellular and genomic context.; CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal genomic correlates of disease progression and treatment response in diverse types of glioma and highlight the potential utility of incorporating genomic information into the clinical decision-making for patients with glioma. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: Uveal melanomas (UM) are genetically simple tumors carrying few copy number alterations (CNA) and a low mutation burden, except in rare MBD4-deficient, hypermutated cases. The genomics of uveal melanoma metastatic progression has not been described. We assessed the genetic heterogeneity of primary and metastatic MBD4-proficient and -deficient uveal melanomas.Experimental Design: We prospectively collected 75 metastatic and 16 primary samples from 25 consecutive uveal melanoma patients, and performed whole-exome sequencing.; RESULTS: MBD4-proficient uveal melanomas contained stable genomes at the nucleotide level, acquiring few new single nucleotide variants (SNVs; 16 vs. 13 in metastases and primary tumors, respectively), and no new driver mutation. Five CNAs were recurrently acquired in metastases (losses of 1p, 6q, gains of 1q, 8q, and isodisomy 3). In contrast, MBD4-deficient uveal melanomas carried more than 266 SNVs per sample, with high genetic heterogeneity and TP53, SMARCA4, and GNAS new driver mutations. SNVs in MBD4-deficient contexts were exploited to unveil the timeline of oncogenic events, revealing that metastatic clones arose early after tumor onset. Surprisingly, metastases were not enriched in monosomy 3, a previously defined metastatic risk genomic feature. Monosomy 3 was associated with shorter metastatic-free interval compared with disomy 3 rather than higher rate of relapse.; CONCLUSIONS: MBD4-proficient uveal melanomas are stable at the nucleotide level, without new actionable alterations when metastatic. In contrast, MBD4 deficiency is associated with high genetic heterogeneity and acquisition of new driver mutations. Monosomy 3 is associated with time to relapse rather than rate of relapse, thus opening avenues for a new genetic prognostic classification of uveal melanomas. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Orthopaedics is the least gender-diverse medical specialty. Research suggests that the use of gendered language can contribute to workforce disparity and that gender-neutral language supports the inclusion and advancement of women, but the degree to which gender-neutral language is used by academic departments in what typically is a department's highest position (department chair) has not been characterized.; QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is the proportion of department websites that use the term chairman (as opposed to chair) greater in orthopaedics than in five other surgical and medical specialties? (2) Are departments led by chairs who are women less likely to use "chairman" than those led by men, and does this vary by specialty?; METHODS: Seven hundred fourteen official websites of orthopaedic, neurosurgery, general surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology departments affiliated with 129 allopathic medical schools were screened. Any use of the term chairman on title pages, welcome messages, and faculty profile pages was identified using a Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm and terms were classified based on their location on the site. The overall use of the term chairman was compared by specialty and gender of the chair.; RESULTS: Sixty percent of orthopaedic department websites (71 of 119) used the term chairman at least once, a proportion higher than that of pediatrics (36% [46 of 128]; OR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.63; p < 0.001), internal medicine (31% [38 of 122]; OR 0.030; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.53; p < 0.001), and obstetrics and gynecology (29% [37 of 126]; OR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.48; p < 0.001), but no different than that of neurosurgery (57% [54 of 94]; OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.6; p = 0.74) and general surgery (55% [69 of 125]; OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.4; p = 0.48). Across disciplines, departments whose chairs were women were much less likely to use the term chairman than departments whose chairs were men (14% [17 of 122] versus 50% [297 of 592]; OR 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.28; p < 0.001).; CONCLUSIONS: The frequent use of the term chairman in orthopaedics, coupled with the preference of women to use the term chair, suggests considerable room for growth in the use of gender-equal language in orthopaedics.; CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our current efforts to increase the number of women in orthopaedics may be undermined by gendered language, which can create and reinforce gendered culture in the field. Electing to use gender-neutral leadership titles, while a relatively small step in the pursuit of a more gender-equal environment, presents an immediate and no-cost way to support a more inclusive culture and counteract unconscious gender bias. Future studies should explore the individual attitudes of chairs regarding the use of gendered titles and identify additional ways in which biases may manifest; for example, the use of gendered language in interpersonal communications and the presence of unconscious bias in leadership evaluations. Continued efforts to understand implicit bias in orthopaedics can guide actionable strategies for counteracting gendered stereotypes of the specialty, in turn aiding initiatives to recruit and promote women in the field.

AB Corporate meetings are a crucial part of business activities. While numerous academic papers investigated how to make the scheduling process of meetings faster or even automatic, little work has been done yet to facilitate the retrospective reasoning about how time is spent on meetings. Traditional calendar applications do not allow users to extract actionable statistics although it has been shown that reflection-oriented design can increase the users' understanding of their habits and can thereby encourage a shift towards better practices. In this paper, we present MineTime Insight, a tool made of multiple coordinated views for the exploration of personal calendar data, with the overarching goal of improving short and long-term scheduling decisions. Despite being focused on the working environment, our work builds upon recent results in the field of Personal Visual Analytics, as it targets users not necessarily expert in visualization and data analysis. We demonstrate the potential of MineTime Insight, when applied to the agenda of an executive manager. Finally, we discuss the results of an informal user study and a field study. Our results suggest that our visual representations are perceived as easy to understand and helpful towards a change in the scheduling habits.

AB As currently conceived, precision public health is at risk of becoming precision medicine at a population level. This paper outlines a framework for precision public health that, in contrast to its current operationalisation, is consistent with public health principles because it integrates factors at all levels, while illuminating social position as a fundamental determinant of health and health inequities. We review conceptual foundations of public health, outline a proposed framework for precision public health and describe its operationalisation within research and practice. Social position shapes individuals' unequal experiences of the social determinants of health. Thus, in our formulation, precision public health investigates how multiple dimensions of social position interact to confer health risk differently for precisely defined population subgroups according to the social contexts in which they are embedded, while considering relevant biological and behavioural factors. It leverages this information to uncover the precise and intersecting social structures that pattern health outcomes, and to identify actionable interventions within the social contexts of affected groups. We contend that studies informed by this framework offer greater potential to improve health than current conceptualisations of precision public health that do not address root causes. Moreover, expanding beyond master categories of social position and operationalising these categories in more precise ways across time and place can enrich public health research through greater attention to the heterogeneity of social positions, their causes and health effects, leading to the identification of points of intervention that are specific enough to be useful in reducing health inequities. Failure to attend to this level of particularity may mask the true nature of health risk, the causal mechanisms at play and appropriate interventions. Conceptualised thus, precision public health is a research endeavour with much to offer by way of understanding and intervening on the causes of poor health and health inequities.As currently conceived, precision public health is at risk of becoming precision medicine at a population level.

AB Innovation has the potential to improve the quality of care and health service delivery, but maximising the reach and impact of innovation to achieve large-scale health system transformation remains understudied. Interest is growing in three processes of the innovation journey within health systems, namely the spread, sustainability and scale-up (3S) of innovation. Recent reviews examine what we know about these processes. However, there is little research on how to support and operationalise the 3S. This study aims to improve our understanding of the 3S of healthcare innovations. We focus specifically on the definitions of the 3S, the mechanisms that underpin them, and the conditions that either enable or limit their potential. We conducted a scoping review, systematically investigating six bibliographic databases to search, screen and select relevant literature on the 3S of healthcare innovations. We screened 641 papers, then completed a full-text review of 112 identified as relevant based on title and abstract. A total of 24 papers were retained for analysis. Data were extracted and synthesised through descriptive and inductive thematic analysis. From this, we develop a framework of actionable guidance for health system actors aiming to leverage the 3S of innovation across five key areas of focus, as follows: (1) focus on the why, (2) focus on perceived-value and feasibility, (3) focus on what people do, rather than what they should be doing, (4) focus on creating a dialogue between policy and delivery, and (5) focus on inclusivity and capacity building. While there is no standardised approach to foster the 3S of healthcare innovations, a variety of practical frameworks and tools exist to support stakeholders along this journey.

AB BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence reveals the importance of the microbiome in health and disease and inseparable host-microbial dependencies. Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., a replacement of the cellular components of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, includingcancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g., at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly.; RESULTS: In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) high concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and B cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.; CONCLUSIONS: We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution, and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.

AB Colorectal cancer is the fourth cause of death from cancer worldwide mainly due to the high incidence of drug-resistance. During a screen for new actionable targets in drug-resistant tumours we recently identified p65BTK - a novel oncogenic isoform of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Studying three different cohorts of patients here we show that p65BTK expression correlates with histotype and cancer progression. Using drug-resistant TP53-null colon cancer cells as a model we demonstrated that p65BTK silencing or chemical inhibition overcame the 5-fluorouracil resistance of CRC cell lines and patient-derived organoids and significantly reduced the growth of xenografted tumours. Mechanistically, we show that blocking p65BTK in drug-resistant cells abolished a 5-FU-elicited TGFB1 protective response and triggered E2F-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that targeting p65BTK restores the apoptotic response to chemotherapy of drug-resistant CRCs and gives a proof-of-concept for suggesting the use of BTK inhibitors in combination with 5-FU as a novel therapeutic approach in CRC patients.

AB BACKGROUND: State child welfare agencies collect, store, and manage vast amounts of data. However, they often do not have the right data, or the data is problematic or difficult to inform strategies to improve services and system processes. Considerable resources are required to read and code these text data. Data science and text mining offer potentially efficient and cost-effective strategies for maximizing the value of these data.; OBJECTIVE: The current study tests the feasibility of using text mining for extracting information from unstructured text to better understand substance-related problems among families investigated for abuse or neglect.; METHOD: A state child welfare agency provided written summaries from investigations of child abuse and neglect. Expert human reviewers coded 2956 investigation summaries based on whether the caseworker observed a substance-related problem. These coded documents were used to develop, train, and validate computer models that could perform the coding on an automated basis.; RESULTS: A set of computer models achieved greater than 90% accuracy when judged against expert human reviewers. Fleiss kappa estimates among computer models and expert human reviewers exceeded .80, indicating that expert human reviewer ratings are exchangeable with the computer models.; CONCLUSION: These results provide compelling evidence that text mining procedures can be a cost-effective and efficient solution for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. Additional research is necessary to understand how to extract the actionable insights from these under-utilized stores of data in child welfare. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of genetic ancestry characterization is increasing in genomic implementation efforts, and clinical pharmacogenomic guidelines are being published that include population-specific recommendations. Our aim was to test the ability of focused clinical pharmacogenomic SNP panels to estimate individual genetic ancestry (IGA) and implement population-specific pharmacogenomic clinical decision-support (CDS) tools. Principle components and STRUCTURE were utilized to assess differences in genetic composition and estimate IGA among 1572 individuals from 1000 Genomes, two independent cohorts of Caucasians and African Americans (AAs), plus a real-world validation population of patients undergoing pharmacogenomic genotyping. We found that clinical pharmacogenomic SNP panels accurately estimate IGA compared to genome-wide genotyping and identify AAs with≥70 African ancestry (sensitivity >82%, specificity >80%, PPV >95%, NPV >47%). We also validated a new AA-specific warfarin dosing algorithm for patients with≥70% African ancestry and implemented it at our institution as a novel CDS tool. Consideration of IGA to develop an institutional CDS tool was accomplished to enable population-specific pharmacogenomic guidance at the point-of-care. These capabilities were immediately applied for guidance of warfarin dosing in AAs versus Caucasians, but also provide a real-world model that can be extended to other populations and drugs as actionable genomic evidence accumulates.

AB Hemodynamics play a central role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF), yet their proper assessment and optimization remains challenging. Heart failure is defined as the inability of the heart to deliver adequate perfusion (cardiac output) to the body at rest or exercise, or to require an elevation in cardiac filling pressures in order to do this. This bedrock definition is important because it relies on measurable quantities (filling pressures and output) that are readily assessed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Here we present three cases to illustrate how better understanding of the determinants of cardiac output and stroke volume: preload, afterload, contractility, and lusitropy, as well as the determinants of congestion (high filling pressures) may be used to guide optimization of hemodynamic status. The goal is that the readers will be able to think more critically when evaluating the hemodynamics of their patient in HF and recognize the complex interplay that determines the complex balance between cardiac ejection and filling capabilities, and how this alters symptoms and outcomes for patients with HF. KEY POINTS: Careful assessment of hemodynamics in the catheterization laboratory allows for actionable insight to a patient's volume status, cardiac function and can help prognosticate outcomes. Exercise hemodynamics in heart failure is a powerful tool to better understand the cause of symptoms and predict outcomes. Clinicians should aim to decrease biventricular filling pressures to normal values to improve morbidity and reduce risk for readmission. In patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, clinicians should aim to decrease afterload as much as can be tolerated by the renal function and patient's symptoms. Low cardiac output can often be improved by optimizing preload and afterload rather than initiating inotropes, which should be reserved until needed. In advanced heart failure, the right heart function becomes a key determinant of symptoms and outcomes. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Congenital anomalies are the leading cause of early neonatal death in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), but the genetic causes are unclear. This study aims to investigate the genetic causes of infant deaths in a NICU in China.; METHODS: Newborns who died in the hospital or died within 1 week of discharge were enrolled from Children's Hospital of Fudan University between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017. Whole exome sequencing was performed in all patients after death.; RESULTS: There were 223 deceased newborns with a median age at death of 13 days. In total, 44 (19.7%) infants were identified with a genetic finding, including 40 with single nucleotide variants (SNVs), two with CNVs and two with both SNVs and CNVs. Thirteen (31%, 13/42) patients with SNVs had medically actionable disorders based on genetic diagnosis, which included 10 genes. Multiple congenital malformation was identified as the leading genetic cause of death in NICUs with 13 newborns identified with variants in genes related to multiple congenital malformations. For newborns who died on the first day, the most common genetic cause of death was major heart defects, while metabolic disorders and respiratory failure were more common for newborns who died in the first 2 weeks.; CONCLUSION: Our study shows genetic findings among early infant deaths in NICUs and provides critical genetic information for precise genetic counselling for the families. Effective therapies enable the improvement of more than a quarter of newborns with molecular diagnoses if diagnosed in time. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

However, conducting a workshop for participants from conflict zones such as Palestine provided an entirely new perspective for this author. While the bioethics discourse may translate into useful and actionable guidelines in the free world to help uphold human dignity, to those living in occupied territories and conflict zones, in the face of their lived lives, it appears little more than a self-serving academic exercise by "parachute bioethicists".

AB BACKGROUND: The clinical role of sputum Gram stain (SGS) in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis remains controversial. A 1996 meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of SGS reported heterogeneous results. To update the available evidence, we performed a systematic review and a Bayesian standard and latent-class model meta-analysis.; METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central by August 23, 2018 to identify studies reporting on the diagnostic accuracy, yield (percentage of patients with any pathogen(s) correctly identified by SGS), and clinical outcomes of SGS in adult patients with CAP. Two reviewers extracted the data. We quantitatively synthesized the diagnostic accuracy and yield, and descriptively analyzed other outcomes.; RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with 4,533 patients were included. The methodological and reporting quality of the included studies was limited. When good-quality sputum specimens were selected, SGS had a summary sensitivity of 0.69 (95% credible intervals [CrI], 0.56-0.80) and specificity of 0.91 (CrI, 0.83-0.96) for detecting Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a sensitivity of 0.76 (CrI, 0.60-0.87) and specificity of 0.97 (CrI, 0.91-0.99) for Haemophilus influenzae. Adjusted analyses accounting for imperfect reference standards provided higher specificity estimates than the unadjusted analyses. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 73% (CrI, 26-96%) of good-quality specimens, and 36% (CrI, 22-53%) of all specimens regardless of quality. Evidence on other bacteria was sparse.; CONCLUSIONS: SGS was highly specific to diagnose S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae infections in patients with CAP. With good-quality specimens, SGS can provide clinically actionable information for pathogen-directed antibiotic therapies. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB The advancement of precision medicine requires new methods to coordinate and deliver genetic data from heterogeneous sources to physicians and patients. The eMERGE III Network enrolled >25,000 participants from biobank and prospective cohorts of predominantly healthy individuals for clinical genetic testing to determine clinically actionable findings. The network developed protocols linking together the 11 participant collection sites and 2 clinical genetic testing laboratories. DNA capture panels targeting 109 genes were used for testing of DNA and sample collection, data generation, interpretation, reporting, delivery, and storage were each harmonized. A compliant and secure network enabled ongoing review and reconciliation of clinical interpretations, while maintaining communication and data sharing between clinicians and investigators. A total of 202 individuals had positive diagnostic findings relevant to the indication for testing and 1,294 had additional/secondary findings of medical significance deemed to be returnable, establishing data return rates for other testing endeavors. This study accomplished integration of structured genomic results into multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems, setting the stage for clinical decision support to enable genomic medicine. Further, the established processes enable different sequencing sites to harmonize technical and interpretive aspects of sequencing tests, a critical achievement toward global standardization of genomic testing. The eMERGE protocols and tools are available for widespread dissemination. Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics. All rights reserved.

AB As clinical testing for Mendelian causes of colorectal cancer (CRC) is largely driven by recognition of family history and early age of onset, the rates of such findings among individuals with prevalent CRC not recognized to have these features is largely unknown. We evaluated actionable genomic findings in community-based participants ascertained by three phenotypes: (1) CRC, (2) one or more adenomatous colon polyps, and (3) control participants over age 59 years without CRC or colon polyps. These participants underwent sequencing for a panel of genes that included colorectal cancer/polyp (CRC/P)-associated and actionable incidental findings genes. Those with CRC had a 3.8% rate of positive results (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) for a CRC-associated gene variant, despite generally being older at CRC onset (mean 72 years). Those ascertained for polyps had a 0.8% positive rate and those with no CRC/P had a positive rate of 0.2%. Though incidental finding rates unrelated to colon cancer were similar for all groups, our positive rate for cardiovascular findings exceeds disease prevalence, suggesting that variant interpretation challenges or low penetrance in these genes. The rate of HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) homozygotes in the CRC group reinforces a previously reported, but relatively unexplored, association between hemochromatosis and CRC. These results in a general clinical population suggest that current testing strategies could be improved in order to better detect Mendelian CRC-associated conditions. These data also underscore the need for additional functional and familial evidence to clarify the pathogenicity and penetrance of variants deemed pathogenic or likely pathogenic, particularly among the actionable genes associated with cardiovascular disease.

AB BACKGROUND: The accurate identification of the tissue of origin is critical for optimal management of cancer patients particularly those who develop multiple malignancies; however, conventional diagnostic methods at times may fail to provide conclusive diagnosis of the origin of the malignancy. Herein, we describe the use of targeted sequencing in distinguishing the primary and metastatic tumors in a patient with metachronous malignancies in the lung, colon and kidney.; CASE PRESENTATION: In December 2016, a 55-year-old Chinese male was diagnosed with stage IB lung adenosquamous carcinoma and treated with left lower lobectomy and 4cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. After being disease-free for 3.5months, three colonic polyps were discovered and were diagnosed as invasive adenocarcinoma after polypectomy. Within 5.4months from the polypectomy, squamous cell renal carcinoma was identified and was managed by radical nephrectomy. Immunohistochemistry results were inconclusive on the origin of the kidney tumor. Hence, the three archived surgical tissue samples were sequenced using a targeted panel with 520 cancer-related genes. Analysis revealed similar mutational signature between the lung and kidney tumors and a distinct mutational profile for the colon tumor, suggesting that the lung and colon malignancies were primary tumors, while the kidney tumor originated from the lung, revealing a diagnosis of metastatic double primary cancer - lung carcinoma with renal cell metastasis and second primary colon carcinoma.; CONCLUSION: Mutational profiling using targeted sequencing is valuable not only for the detection of actionable mutations, but also in the identification of the origin of tumors. This diagnostic approach should be considered in similar scenarios.

AB Many in silico predictors of genetic variant pathogenicity have been previously developed, but there is currently no standard application of these algorithms for variant assessment. Using 4,094 ClinVar-curated missense variants in clinically actionable genes, we evaluated the accuracy and yield of benign and deleterious evidence in 5 in silico meta-predictors, as well as agreement of SIFT and PolyPhen2, and report the derived thresholds for the best performing predictor(s). REVEL and BayesDel outperformed all other meta-predictors (CADD, MetaSVM, Eigen), with higher positive predictive value, comparable negative predictive value, higher yield, and greater overall prediction performance. Agreement of SIFT and PolyPhen2 resulted in slightly higher yield but lower overall prediction performance than REVEL or BayesDel. Our results support the use of gene-level rather than generalized thresholds, when gene-level thresholds can be estimated. Our results also support the use of 2-sided thresholds, which allow for uncertainty, rather than a single, binary cut-point for assigning benign and deleterious evidence. The gene-level 2-sided thresholds we derived for REVEL or BayesDel can be used to assess in silico evidence for missense variants in accordance with current classification guidelines.

AB PURPOSE: Identification of clinically actionable molecular subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is key to improving patient outcome. Intertumoral metabolic heterogeneity contributes to cancer survival and the balance between distinct metabolic pathways may influence PDAC outcome. We hypothesized that PDAC can be stratified into prognostic metabolic subgroups based on alterations in the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed bioinformatics analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data in an integrated cohort of 325 resectable and nonresectable PDAC. The resectable datasets included retrospective The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohorts. The nonresectable PDAC cohort studies included prospective COMPASS, PanGen, and BC Cancer Personalized OncoGenomics program (POG).; RESULTS: On the basis of the median normalized expression of glycolytic and cholesterogenic genes, four subgroups were identified: quiescent, glycolytic, cholesterogenic, and mixed. Glycolytic tumors were associated with the shortest median survival in resectable (log-rank test P = 0.018) and metastatic settings (log-rank test P = 0.027). Patients with cholesterogenic tumors had the longest median survival. KRAS and MYC-amplified tumors had higher expression of glycolytic genes than tumors with normal or lost copies of the oncogenes (Wilcoxon rank sum test P = 0.015). Glycolytic tumors had the lowest expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carriers MPC1 and MPC2. Glycolytic and cholesterogenic gene expression correlated with the expression of prognostic PDAC subtype classifier genes.; CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic classification specific to glycolytic and cholesterogenic pathways provides novel biological insight into previously established PDAC subtypes and may help develop personalized therapies targeting unique tumor metabolic profiles. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE: Large-scale array-based and sequencing studies have advanced our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders, but also increased the potential to generate an exponentially larger amount of clinically relevant findings. As genomic testing becomes more widespread in psychiatry research, urgency grows to establish best practices for offering return of results (RoR) to individuals at risk or diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder.; METHODS: We interviewed an international sample (n=39) of psychiatric genetics researchers to examine conceptualizations of "best practices" for RoR to individual research participants.; RESULTS: While the vast majority of researchers do not offer RoR, most believed medically actionable findings (85%) and clinically valid but non-medically actionable findings (54%) should be offered. Researchers identified three main areas for improvement: interfacing with individual participants; interdisciplinary training, guidance, and integration; and quality planning and resource allocation for returning results.; CONCLUSION: There are significant gaps between researchers' visions for "best" versus "actual" RoR practices. While researchers call for participant-centered practices, including consent practices that consider any special needs of participants with psychiatric disorders, return of individually meaningful results, and effective follow-up and provisions for treatment, the current reality is that consent and RoR practices lack standardized and evidence-based norms.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite growing evidence of diagnostic yield and clinical utility of whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with undiagnosed diseases, there remain significant cost and reimbursement barriers limiting access to such testing. The diagnostic yield and resulting clinical actions of WES for patients who previously faced insurance coverage barriers have not yet been explored.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinical WES outcomes for patients facing insurance coverage barriers prior to clinical WES and who subsequently enrolled in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). Clinical WES was completed as a result of participation in the UDN. Payer type, molecular diagnostic yield, and resulting clinical actions were evaluated.; RESULTS: Sixty-six patients in the UDN faced insurance coverage barriers to WES at the time of enrollment (67% public payer, 26% private payer). Forty-two of 66 (64%) received insurance denial for clinician-ordered WES, 19/66 (29%) had health insurance through a payer known not to cover WES, and 5/66 (8%) had previous payer denial of other genetic tests. Clinical WES results yielded a molecular diagnosis in 23 of 66 patients (35% [78% pediatric, 65% neurologic indication]). Molecular diagnosis resulted in clinical actions in 14 of 23 patients (61%).; CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that a substantial proportion of patients who encountered insurance coverage barriers to WES had a clinically actionable molecular diagnosis, supporting the notion that WES has value as a covered benefit for patients who remain undiagnosed despite objective clinical findings. © 2019 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB Excessive numbers of clinical alarms reduce the awareness of caregivers. Frequent alarms, many of which are non-actionable, can lead to cognitive overload, stress, and desensitization to alarms, called "Alarm Fatigue", which can severely impact patient safety. Due to the multifactorial nature of excessive alarming quantitative data about many facets of alarm generation and management are required in order to tackle the problem efficiently and effectively. Since there is no system available which would provide said data, we set out to develop one in the form of a data warehouse based on a thorough understanding of clinicians' needs. The developed system answers the users' needs in terms of readily providing them information on a daily basis, but also serves as a data source for further research. Further work is needed to include alarm sources from outside the patient monitoring infrastructure.

AB Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are rare, heterogeneous malignancies that include cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer (GBC). Cholangiocarcinoma subtypes differ by anatomic location and molecular profile. Currently, resection with lymphadenectomy is the only curative treatment of locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Given the high risk of recurrence, multi-modality therapy spanning surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy should be considered. Current data is discordant and there is limited prospective data to support an optimal treatment regimen, though recent studies have demonstrated the utility of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in specific settings and patient populations. There is a potential role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable disease or chemoradiation in select patients with unresectable, locally advanced disease. Randomized clinical trials are necessary to establish the effectiveness of therapies specific to disease sites, especially with the emerging role of immunotherapy and targeted therapy to actionable mutations.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic testing is becoming an essential tool for breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and treatment pathway, and particularly important for early detection and cancer prevention. The purpose of this study was to explore the diagnostic yield of targeted sequencing of the high priority BC genes.; METHODS: We have utilized a cost-effective targeted sequencing approach of high priority actionable BC genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ERBB2 and TP53) in a homogeneous patient cohort from Bangladesh (n=52) by using tumor and blood samples.; RESULTS: Blood derived targeted sequencing revealed 25.58% (11/43) clinically relevant mutations (both pathogenic and variants of uncertain significance (VUS)), with 13.95% (6/43) of samples carrying a pathogenic mutations. We have identified and validated five novel pathogenic germline mutations in this cohort, comprising of two frameshift deletions in BRCA2, and missense mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ERBB2 gene respectively. Furthermore, we have identified three pathogenic mutations and a VUS within three tumor samples, including a sample carrying pathogenic mutations impacting both TP53 (c.322dupG; a novel frameshift insertion) and BRCA1 genes (c.116G>A). 22% of tissue samples had a clinically relevant TP53 mutation. Although the cohort is small, we have found pathogenic mutations to be enriched in BRCA2 (9.30%, 4/43) compare to BRCA1 (4.65%, 2/43). The frequency of germline VUS mutations found to be similar in both BRCA1 (4.65%; 2/43) and BRCA2 (4.65%; 2/43) compared to ERBB2 (2.32%; 1/43).; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first genetic study of BC predisposition genes in this population, implies that genetic screening through targeted sequencing can detect clinically significant and actionable BC-relevant mutations.

AB Tobacco use is a chronic relapsing disease, and remains the leading cause of preventable death in much of the world. Increasingly, tobacco use, chiefly cigarette smoking, is being framed as a chronic disease, with periods of use and periods of abstinence. An implicit component of this conceptualization is that treatment-both counseling and pharmacotherapy-may be needed at various intervals for extended periods of time, perhaps over an individual's lifetime. This would mirror the treatment of other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Yet, clinical trials of tobacco dependence treatment still generally model outcome measures in terms of cessation, abstinence, or quitting, measured at discrete time points. This reinforces the notion that smoking, or tobacco dependence, is a dichotomous condition, and that one is either "cured," or not. Although the goal of treating tobacco dependence is to ensure long-term abstinence (i.e. "quitting"), this model is discordant with clinical reality, in which of periods of tobacco use are interspersed with periods of abstinence. Hence, the goal of treatment is to lengthen the duration of the latter, while shortening the duration of the former. In the clinical arena, this dichotomous model of tobacco use is reflected in electronic health records, where smoking is generally categorized as current, former, or never. We propose that clinicians move away from the dichotomous categorization of tobacco use, and adopt methods used to categorize the status of other chronic conditions. Specifically, biomarkers such as carbon monoxide, cotinine, and anabasine, measured at regular intervals, can provide clinicians with much clearer, clinically relevant and actionable assessments of current tobacco use by their patients. This can be done without making reference to dichotomous states such as current or former use of tobacco. In psychological terms, one can frame tobacco use in terms of states, attributes in specific situations at discrete moments in time, rather than the more durable traits.

AB Background: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an uncommon but highly fatal malignancy, with limited adjuvant therapy. The present study aims to explore the actionable alterations and precision oncology for GBC patients.; Methods: Patients with pathologically confirmed GBC who progressed after first-line systemic treatment were enrolled. Genomic alterations were captured by ultra-deep targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). The actionabilities of alterations and the therapeutic regimens were evaluated by a multidisciplinary tumor board (MDTB).; Results: Sixty patients with GBC were enrolled and analyzed. tNGS was successfully achieved in all patients. The median tumor mutation burden for GBC patients was 5.4 (range: 0.8-36.74) mutations/Mb, and the most common mutations were in TP53 (73%), CDKN2A (25%) and PIK3CA (20%). The most frequently copy-number altered genes were CDKN2A deletion (11.7%) and ERBB2 amplification (13.3%). 23% of the patients displayed gene fusion; 17 fusion events were identified, and 14 of the 17 fusion events co-occurred with mutations in driver genes. In total, 46 of the 60 (76%) patients were identified as possessing at least one actionable target to proceed precision oncology.; Conclusions: The present study revealed the mutational profile for the clinical practice of precision oncology in GBC patients. 2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

AB Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the dynamic and reversible acetylation of proteins, an epigenetic regulatory mechanism associated with multiple cancers. Indeed, HDAC inhibitors are already approved in the clinic. The HAT paralogs p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) have been implicated in human pathological conditions including several hematological malignancies and androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer. Others have reported CoA-competitive inhibitors of p300 and CBP with cell-based activity. Here, we describe 2 compounds, CPI-076 and CPI-090, discovered through p300-HAT high throughput screening screening, which inhibit p300-HAT via binding at an allosteric site. We present the high resolution (1.7 and 2.3A) co-crystal structures of these molecules bound to a previously undescribed allosteric site of p300-HAT. Derivatization yielded actionable structure-activity relationships, but the full-length enzymatic assay demonstrated that this allosteric HAT inhibitor series was artifactual, inhibiting only the HAT domain of p300 with no effect on the full-length enzyme. © 2019 Author(s).

AB Tennessee is the only state in the United States that has regularly published a document monitoring men's health and assessing men's health disparities. Vanderbilt University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the Tennessee Department of Health, Meharry Medical College, Tennessee Men's Health Network, and health providers and advocates across the state have come together to publish a set of indicators as the Tennessee Men's Health Report Card (TMHRC). This article describes the origins, structure, development, and lessons learned from publishing report cards in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2017. The report card highlights statistically significant changes in trends over time, identifies racial, ethnic, age, and geographic differences among men, highlights connections to regional and statewide public health initiatives, and suggests priorities for improving men's health in Tennessee. State data were compared to Healthy People 2020 Objectives and graded based on the degree of discrepancy between the goal and the current reality for Tennessee men. Over the four iterations of the report card, the TMHRC team has made significant adjustments to the ways they analyze and present the data, utilize grades and graphics, consider the implications of the data for the economic well-being of the state, and disseminate the findings across the state to different stakeholders. It is important to go beyond creating a summary of information; rather, data should be shared in ways that are easily understood, actionable, and applicable to different audiences. It is also critical to highlight promising policy and programmatic initiatives to improve men's health in the state.

AB Thymic cancers arise from epithelial cells of the thymus and have a predilection for intrathoracic spread. Clinical behavior varies from relatively indolent to highly aggressive with a capacity to metastasize widely and adversely affect survival. Paraneoplastic autoimmune disorders are frequently observed in association with thymoma and have a significant impact on quality of life. Underlying immune deficits associated with thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) increase the risk for development of opportunistic infections and emergence of extrathymic malignancies. Advances in the molecular characterization of thymic tumors have revealed the lowest tumor mutation burden among all adult cancers and the occurrence of distinct molecular subtypes of these diseases. Mutations in general transcription factor IIi (GTF2I) are unique to TETs and are rarely observed in other malignancies. The infrequency of actionable mutations has created obstacles for the development of biologic therapies and has spurred research to uncover druggable genomic targets. Persistence of autoreactive T cells due to altered thymic function increases the risk for development of severe immune-related toxicity and limits opportunities for use of immune-based therapies, especially in patients with thymoma. In this paper we review emerging data on the molecular characterization and immunobiology of thymic tumors and highlight clinical implications of these discoveries.

AB Transport programs are highly regulated health care organizations. Of the many imposers of regulations, those controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration are some of the least understood by transport programs. This article serves to lift the regulatory fog surrounding controlled substances and to provide clear and actionable guidance to transport programs. Storage, security, and recordkeeping requirements for emergency medical service organizations can be confusing given that there are no specific regulations for emergency medical services. Transport programs are subject to all the current regulations, and nonadherence can result in significant fines and loss of public trust for any transport program found to be in violation.

AB INTRODUCTION: Facilitating processes for coordinated action in the field of health promotion is a challenge. Poorthuis and Bijl's (2006) Participatory Network Mapping Tool (PNMT) uses visualization and discussion to map the positions and roles of network actors, stimulate learning processes, and elicit actionable knowledge. This article describes the results from the application of the PNMT in networks of two Dutch health promotion programmes (Health Race and BeweegKuur) with the aim of determining the value of the PNMT to partners in health promotions networks.; METHODS: A qualitative secondary analysis (QSA) was conducted to clarify positions and roles, learning processes, and actionable knowledge of network actors in existing data sets including five group interviews of the Health Race programme and 16 individual interviews and 15 group interviews of the BeweegKuur programme.; RESULTS: The PNMT maps both positions and roles of (missing) actors and makes successes (e.g. knowing each other) and challenges (e.g. implementing new activities) visible. Thus, the PNMT provides a starting point for discussion and reflection and eliciting actionable knowledge such as involving new actors and target populations in the programme.; CONCLUSION: The PNMT contributes to the facilitation of coordinated action in health promotion networks by making positions and roles of network partners visible. In combination with dialogue and reflection the PNMT helps to elucidate factors influencing coordinated action and outcomes. The PNMT is valuable in grasping intangible aspects between actors by stimulating collective learning. These insights can be used by researchers and network actors to achieve more successful coordinated action for health promotion.

AB INTRODUCTION: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new form of HIV prevention being considered for inclusion in national prevention portfolios. Many mathematical modelling studies have been undertaken that speak to the impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of PrEP programmes. We assess the available evidence from mathematical modelling studies to inform programme planning and policy decision making for PrEP and further research directions.; METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the published modelling literature. Articles published in English which modelled oral PrEP in sub-Saharan Africa, or non-specific settings with relevance to generalized HIV epidemic settings, were included. Data were extracted for the strategies of PrEP use modelled, and the impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of PrEP for each strategy. We define an algorithm to assess the quality and relevance of studies included, summarize the available evidence and identify the current gaps in modelling. Recommendations are generated for future modelling applications and data collection.; RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We reviewed 1924 abstracts and included 44 studies spanning 2007 to 2017. Modelling has reported that PrEP can be a cost-effective addition to HIV prevention portfolios for some use cases, but also that it would not be cost-effective to fund PrEP before other prevention interventions are expanded. However, our assessment of the quality of the modelling indicates cost-effectiveness analyses failed to comply with standards of reporting for economic evaluations and the assessment of relevance highlighted that both key parameters and scenarios are now outdated. Current evidence gaps include modelling to inform service development using updated programmatic information and ex post modelling to evaluate and inform efficient deployment of resources in support of PrEP, especially among key populations, using direct evidence of cost, adherence and uptake patterns.; CONCLUSIONS: Updated modelling which more appropriately captures PrEP programme delivery, uses current intervention scenarios, and is parameterized with data from demonstration and implementation projects is needed in support of more conclusive findings and actionable recommendations for programmes and policy. Future analyses should address these issues, aligning with countries to support the needs of programme planners and decision makers for models to more directly inform programme planning and policy. © 2019 The Authors.

AB The major goal of the radiology report is to deliver timely, accurate, and actionable information to the patient care team and the patient. Structured reporting offers multiple advantages over traditional free-text reporting, including reduction in diagnostic error, comprehensiveness, adherence to national consensus guidelines, revenue capture, data collection, and research. Various technological innovationsenhance integration of structured reporting into everyday clinical practice. This review discusses the benefits of innovations in radiology reporting to the clinical decision process, the patient experience, the cost of imaging, and the overall contributions to the health of the population.

AB Improving population health requires a focus on neighborhoods with high rates of illness. We aimed to reduce hospital days for children from two high-morbidity, high-poverty neighborhoods in Cincinnati, Ohio, to narrow the gap between their neighborhoods and healthier ones. We also sought to use this population health improvement initiative to develop and refine a theory for how to narrow equity gaps across broader geographic areas. We relied upon quality improvement methods and a learning health system approach. Interventions included the optimization of chronic disease management; transitions in care; mitigation of social risk; and use of actionable, real-time data. The inpatient bed-day rate for the two target neighborhoods decreased by 18percent from baseline (July 2012-June 2015) to the improvement phase (July 2015-June 2018). Hospitalizations decreased by 20percent. There was no similar decrease in demographically comparable neighborhoods. We see the neighborhood as a relevant frame for achieving equity and building a multisector culture of health.

AB Academic medical centers (AMCs) are transforming to improve their care delivery and learning environments so that they build a culture that fosters high-value care. However, AMCs struggle to create learning environments where trainees are part of the reason for institutional success and their initiatives have high impact and are sustainable. The authors believe that AMCs can reach these goals if they codevelop strategic priorities and provide infrastructure to support alignment between the missions of health delivery systems and graduate medical education (GME).They outline four steps for AMCs and policy makers to create an infrastructure that supports this alignment to deliver value-based care. First, AMCs can align strategic priorities between delivery systems and educators by creating a common understanding of why initiatives require priorities within the health care system. Second, AMCs can support alignment with data from multiple sources that are reliable, valid, and actionable for trainees. Third, resident initiatives can create sustained impact by linking trainees to the institutional staff and infrastructure supporting value improvement efforts. Fourth, incentive payment programs through medical education could augment current system incentives to propel further alignment between education and delivery systems. The authors support their recommendations with concrete examples from emerging models created by GME and health delivery system leaders at AMCs across the country.

AB BACKGROUND: While the role of acute non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to improve outcome in acute life-threatening hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD, the evidence of clinical efficacy of long-term home NIV (LTH-NIV) for management of COPD is less. This document provides evidence-based recommendations for the clinical application of LTH-NIV in chronic hypercapnic COPD patients.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The European Respiratory Society task force committee was composed of clinicians, methodologists and experts in the field of LTH-NIV. The committee developed recommendations based on the GRADE (Grading, Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. The GRADE Evidence to Decision framework was used to formulate recommendations. A number of topics were addressed under a narrative format which provides a useful context for clinicians and patients.; RESULTS: The task force committee delivered conditional recommendations for four actionable PICO (target population-intervention-comparator-outcome) questions, 1) suggesting for the use of LTH-NIV in stable hypercapnic COPD; 2) suggesting for the use of LTH-NIV in COPD patients following a COPD exacerbation requiring acute NIV 3) suggesting for the use of NIV settings targeting a reduction in carbon dioxide and 4) suggesting for using fixed pressure support as first choice ventilator mode.; CONCLUSIONS: Managing hypercapnia may be an important intervention for improving the health outcome of COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure. The task force conditionally supports the application of LTH-NIV to improve health outcome by targeting a reduction in carbon dioxide in COPD patients with persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure. These recommendations should be applied in clinical practice by practitioners that routinely care for chronic hypercapnic COPD patients. Copyright ©ERS 2019.

AB Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in plasma provides an easily accessible source of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for detecting actionable genomic alterations that can be used to guide colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment and surveillance. The goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using a traditional amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) on Ion Torrent platform to detect low-frequency alleles in ctDNA and compare it with a digital NGS assay specifically designed to detect low-frequency variants (as low as 0.1%) to provide evidence for the standard care of CRC. The study cohort consisted of 48 CRC patients for whom matched samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were available. DNA samples from different sources were sequenced on different platforms using commercial protocols. Our results demonstrate that the ccfDNA sequencing with the traditional NGS can be reliably used in an integrated workflow to detect low-frequency somatic variants in CRC. We found a high degree of concordance between traditional NGS and digital NGS in profiling mutant alleles in ccfDNA. These findings suggest that the traditional NGS is a viable alternative to digital sequencing of ccfDNA at allele frequency above 1%. ccfDNA sequencing can not only provide real-time monitoring of CRC, but also lay the basis for its application as a clinical diagnostic test to guide personalized therapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: This paper examines how and why to improve care systems for disease management and health promotion for the growing population of cancer survivors with cardiovascular multi-morbidities.; METHOD: We reviewed research characterizing cancer survivors' and their multiple providers' common sense cognitive models of survivors' main health threats, preventable causes of adverse health events, and optimal coping strategies.; RESULTS: Findings indicate that no entity in the health care system self-identifies as claiming primary responsibility to address longstanding unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that heighten survivors' susceptibility to both cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whose improvement could enhance quality of life.; CONCLUSIONS: To address this gap, we propose systems-level changes that integrate health promotion into existing survivorship services by including behavioral risk factor vital signs in the electronic medical record, with default proactive referral to a health promotionist (a paraprofessional coach adept with mobile technologies and supervised by a professional expert in health behavior change). By using the patient's digital tracking data to coach remotely and periodically report progress to providers, the health promotionist closes a gap, creating a connected care system that supports, reinforces, and maintains accountability for healthy lifestyle improvement. No comparable resource solely dedicated to treatment of chronic disease risk behaviors (smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, treatment nonadherence) exists in current models of integrated care. Integrating health promotionists into care delivery channels would remove burden from overtaxed PCPs and instantiate a comprehensive, actionable systems-level schema of health risks and coping strategies needed to have preventive impact with minimal interference to clinical work flow.

AB The Idylla Mutation Test System is an automated, PCR-based mutation testing system. The advantages of this system can greatly impact the delivery of precision medicine. We describe our evaluation, validation, and implementation of this system for routine testing of BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, and NRAS using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer samples. All four Idylla test systems showed excellent concordance with reference methods. The analytical sensitivity ranged from 94.66% to 100%, depending on the cartridge, and specificity was 100%. A few discordant results were noted and further investigated: KRAS Q61L was misclassified as Q61H; KRAS Q61R was not identified; there was a false-negative EGFR double mutation (L861Q and G719A); and there was a false-negative EGFR double mutation (T790M and exon 19 deletion). The limit of detection was determined to be 1% or 5% for the variants with available reference material. The turnaround time was shortened by 7 days on average. Idylla testing of a cohort of 25 non-small-cell lung cancer samples with insufficient material for next-generation sequencing testing delivered results for all cases and identified actionable results for eight cases. In addition, patient care would have been changed in four of these cases: targeted therapies were identified in two cases, and repeated biopsies would have been avoided in two cases. The Idylla molecular testing system is an accessible, rapid, robust, and reliable testing option for both routine and challenging formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens.

AB Endometrial cancer accounts for ~76,000 deaths among women each year worldwide. Disease mortality and the increasing number of new diagnoses make endometrial cancer an important consideration in women's health, particularly in industrialized countries, where the incidence of this tumour type is highest. Most endometrial cancers are carcinomas, with the remainder being sarcomas. Endometrial carcinomas can be classified into several histological subtypes, including endometrioid, serous and clear cell carcinomas. Histological subtyping is currently used routinely to guide prognosis and treatment decisions for endometrial cancer patients, while ongoing studies are evaluating the potential clinical utility of molecular subtyping. In this Review, we summarize the overarching molecular features of endometrial cancers and highlight recent studies assessing the potential clinical utility of specific molecular features for early detection, disease risk stratification and directing targeted therapies.

AB BACKGROUND: Isolated pulmonary involvement is uncommon in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). To characterize outcomes and molecular alterations of this unique patient subset, we conducted a retrospective review of patients with hormone-naive prostate cancer presenting with lung-only metastases.; METHODS: This was a retrospective single-institution study. Medical records of 25 patients presenting with pulmonary-only metastases before receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were analyzed. Germline and/or somatic genomic results, where available (n=16), were documented. Tumor tissue was analyzed using clinical-grade next-generation DNA sequencing assays. Clinical endpoints included complete prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to ADT (<0.1ng/mL), median overall survival (OS) from time of ADT initiation, median PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and failure-free survival (FFS) at 4 years.; RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were notable for 48% of men (12 of 25) having first or second-degree relatives with prostate cancer, compared with 20% expected. Complete PSA responses to ADT were noted in 52% of men, with a median PSA-PFS of 66 months, a 4-year FFS rate of 72%, and a median OS that was not reached after 190 months. In evaluable patients, molecular drivers were enriched for mismatch repair mutations (4 of 16, 25%) and homologous-recombination deficiency mutations (4 of 16, 25%). These results are limited by the small sample size and retrospective nature of this analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study represents one of the largest cohorts of lung-only mHSPC patients to-date. The prevalence of actionable DNA-repair gene alterations was higher than anticipated (any DNA-repair mutation: 8 of 16, 50%). Compared to historical data, these patients appear to have exceptional and durable responses to first-line ADT. This study suggests that pulmonary-tropic mHSPC biology may be fundamentally different from nonpulmonary mHSPC. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to identify actionable genomic alterations in the gynaecological subpopulation of the ProfiLER programme and to report clinical efficacy of recommended targeted treatment (RTT).; METHODS: The ProfiLER programme (NCT01774409) is a multicentric prospective trial aiming to implement molecular profiling in patients with advanced refractory cancers. In this programme, tumour DNA is analysed by targeted next-generation sequencing (69 genes) and by whole genome array comparative genomic hybridisation. Clinical cases and genomic profiles are presented in a dedicated molecular tumour board to guide treatment strategies. We report here an analysis of patients with gynaecological cancers included in this trial.; RESULTS: From February 2013 to February 2017, 309 patients with gynaecologic cancer were included; 279 (90%) had sufficient quality, and 131 patients (42.4%) had at least one actionable genomic alteration in cancer cells. Four alterations were shared by at least 3% of the patients: 27 (9.7%) PIK3CA mutations, 15 (5.4%) KRAS mutations, 11 (3.9%) ERBB2 amplifications and 9 (3.2%) CDKN2A deletions. Forty-one treatments were initiated among 39 patients (12.6% of the screened population): 8 (20%) had a partial response, and other 10 (24%) had a stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 2.7 months. The median overall survival was 15.6 months for patients who received a RTT.; CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling identified actionable alterations in 42.4% of patients with advanced refractory gynaecologic cancer, but only 12.6% were treated with a RTT. Among them, 46% derived clinical benefit (5.8% of the screened population). Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a core set of capabilities and tasks for local health departments (LHDs) to engage in land use and transportation policy processes that promote active transportation.; DESIGN: We conducted a 3-phase modified Delphi study from 2015 to 2017.; SETTING: We recruited a multidisciplinary national expert panel for key informant interviews by telephone and completion of a 2-step online validation process.; PARTICIPANTS: The panel consisted of 58 individuals with expertise in local transportation and policy processes, as well as experience in cross-sector collaboration with public health. Participants represented the disciplines of land use planning, transportation/public works, public health, municipal administration, and active transportation advocacy at the state and local levels.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Key informant interviews elicited initial capabilities and tasks. An online survey solicited rankings of impact and feasibility for capabilities and ratings of importance for associated tasks. Feasibility rankings were used to categorize capabilities according to required resources. Results were presented via second online survey for final input.; RESULTS: Ten capabilities were categorized according to required resources. Fewest resources were as follows: (1) collaborate with public officials; (2) serve on land use or transportation board; and (3) review plans, policies, and projects. Moderate resources were as follows: (4) outreach to the community; (5) educate policy makers; (6) participate in plan and policy development; and (7) participate in project development and design review. Most resources were as follows: (8) participate in data and assessment activities; (9) fund dedicated staffing; and (10) provide funding support.; CONCLUSIONS: These actionable capabilities can guide planning efforts for LHDs of all resource levels.

AB For health care providers, information on community-level social determinants of health is most valuable when it is specific to the populations and health outcomes for which they are responsible. Diabetes and hypertension are highly prevalent conditions whose management requires an interplay of clinical treatment and behavioral modifications that may be sensitive to community conditions. We used geo-linked electronic health records from 2016 of African American patients of a network of federally qualified health centers in Philadelphia, PA to examine cross-sectional associations between characteristics of patients' residential neighborhoods and hypertension and diabetes control (n = 1061 and n = 2633, respectively). Hypertension and diabetes control were defined to align with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting requirements for HRSA-funded health centers. We examined associations with nine measures of neighborhood socioeconomic status (poverty, education, deprivation index), social environment (violent crime, perceived safety and social capital, racial segregation), and built environment (land-use mix, intersection density). In demographics-adjusted log-binomial regression models accounting for neighborhood-level clustering, poor diabetes and hypertension control were more common in highly segregated neighborhoods (i.e., high proportion of African American residents relative to the mean for Philadelphia; prevalence ratio = 1.27 [1.02-1.57] for diabetes, 1.22 [1.12-1.33] for hypertension) and less common in more walkable neighborhoods (i.e., higher retail land use). Neighborhood deprivation was also weakly associated with poor hypertension control. An important consideration in making geographic information actionable for providers is understanding how specific community-level determinants affect the patient population beyond individual-level determinants.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify procedure-specific risk factors independently associated with incisional hernia (IH) and demonstrate the feasibility of preoperative risk stratification through the use of an IH risk calculator app and decision-support interface.; SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: IH occurs after 10% to 15% of all abdominal surgeries (AS) and remains among the most challenging, seemingly unavoidable complications. However, there is a paucity of readily available, actionable tools capable of predicting IH occurrence at the point-of-care.; METHODS: Patients (n = 29,739) undergoing AS from 2005 to 2016 were retrospectively identified within inpatient and ambulatory databases at our institution. Surgically treated IH, complications, and costs were assessed. Predictive models were generated using regression analysis and corroborated using a validation group.; RESULTS: The incidence of operative IH was 3.8% (N = 1127) at an average follow-up of 57.9 months. All variables were weighted according to beta-coefficients generating 8 surgery-specific predictive models for IH occurrence, all of which demonstrated excellent risk discrimination (C-statistic = 0.76-0.89). IH occurred most frequently after colorectal (7.7%) and vascular (5.2%) surgery. The most common occurring risk factors that increased the likelihood of developing IH were history of AS (87.5%) and smoking history (75%). An integrated, surgeon-facing, point-of-care risk prediction instrument was created in an app for preoperative estimation of hernia after AS.; CONCLUSIONS: Operative IH occurred in 3.8% of patients after nearly 5 years of follow-up in a predictable manner. Using a bioinformatics approach, risk models were transformed into 8 unique surgery-specific models. A risk calculator app was developed which stakeholders can access to identify high-risk IH patients at the point-of-care.

AB Clinical trials for investigational new products to treat rare and ultra-rare diseases typically involve a limited number of research sites recruiting from a small pool of patients dispersed over a large geographical area. When remote access is not possible and participants must be present at a trial site, participation in research may require individuals and their families/caregivers to travel great distances, often at significant cost personally and financially and, frequently, for the duration of the trial. This article addresses the ethical and practical issues associated with the practice of sponsors offering financial and other assistance for relocation to trial sites from significant geographical distances, providing both foundational analysis of the ethical issues as well as actionable policy-level guidance on how to best approach these situations.

AB BACKGROUND: Workload from electronic health record (EHR) inbox notifications leads to information overload and contributes to job dissatisfaction and physician burnout. Better understanding of physicians' inbox requirements and workflows could optimize inbox designs, enhance efficiency, and reduce safety risks from information overload.; DESIGN: We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify strategies to enhance EHR inbox design and workflow. First, we performed a secondary analysis of national survey data of all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care practitioners (PCP) to identify major themes in responses to a free-text question soliciting suggestions to improve EHR inbox design and workflows. We then conducted expert interviews of clinicians at five health care systems (1 VA and 4 non-VA settings using 4 different EHRs) to understand existing optimal strategies to improve efficiency and situational awareness related to EHR inbox use. Themes from survey data were cross-validated with interview findings.; RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 2104 PCPs who completed the free-text inbox question (of 5001 PCPs who responded to survey) and used an inductive approach to identify five themes: (1) Inbox notification content should be actionable for patient care and relevant to recipient clinician, (2) Inboxes should reduce risk of losing messages, (3) Inbox functionality should be optimized to improve efficiency of processing notifications, (4) Team support should be leveraged to help with EHR inbox notification burden, (5) Sufficient time should be provided to all clinicians to process EHR inbox notifications. We subsequently interviewed 15 VA and non-VA clinicians and identified 11 unique strategies, each corresponding directly with one of these five themes.; CONCLUSION: Feedback from practicing end-user clinicians provides robust evidence to improve content and design of the EHR inbox and related clinical workflows and organizational policies. Several strategies we identified could improve clinicians' EHR efficiency and satisfaction as well as empower them to work with their local administrators, health IT personnel, and EHR developers to improve these systems.

AB O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is an enzyme that removes alkyl groups at the O6-position of guanine in DNA. MGMT expression is reduced or absent in many tumor types derived from a diverse range of tissues, most notably in glioma. Low MGMT expression confers significant sensitivity to DNA alkylating agents such as temozolomide, providing a natural therapeutic index over normal tissue. In this study, we sought to identify novel approaches that could maximally exploit the therapeutic index between tumor cells and normal tissues based on MGMT expression, as a means to enhance selective tumor cell killing. Temozolomide, unlike other alkylators, activated the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) axis in a manner that was highly dependent on MGMT status. Temozolomide induced growth delay, DNA double-strand breaks, and G2-M cell-cycle arrest, which led to ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1; this effect was dependent on reduced MGMT expression. Treatment of MGMT-deficient cells with temozolomide increased sensitivity to ATR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo across numerous tumor cell types. Taken together, this study reveals a novel approach for selectively targeting MGMT-deficient cells with ATR inhibitors and temozolomide. As ATR inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials, and temozolomide is a commonly used chemotherapeutic, this approach is clinically actionable. Furthermore, this interaction potently exploits a DNA-repair defect found in many cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: Monofunctional alkylating agents sensitize MGMT-deficient tumor cells to ATR inhibitors. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Precision medicine arised as a new paradigm in oncology in which molecular profiling aims at guiding therapy in oncology. The implementation of precision medicine necessitates setting up molecular tumor boards (MTBs) that coordinate the workflow of tumor samples to efficiently seek for actionable molecular alterations. We review here the main precision medicine initiatives that involve MTBs and decipher challenges that still need to be overcome along with future perspectives for a broader implementation of precision medicine in routine patient care.; RECENT FINDINGS: MTBs have been implemented in multiple countries. They identify actionable molecular alteration in up to 50% of patients. However, around 10-20% receive matched therapy and less than 6% of patients experience an objective response. The challenges that need to be overcome for a successful implementation of precision medicine include an earlier molecular profiling of patients during their disease course, the use of liquid biopsies that allow sequential analyses, along with more exhaustive gene panels and extended access to drugs.; SUMMARY: Molecular screening programs allow to successfully guiding patients to individualized therapy in a minority of patients, and few patients actually benefit from these programs.

AB BACKGROUND: One promising approach to influence nutrition behavior is to limit food and beverage marketing to children. Children are a lucrative market and schools may be an effective setting in which to intervene. Studies have shown that marketing in schools is prevalent but little is known about digital marketing (DM) to students in the school setting.; METHODS: We used an online survey to assess DM environments in a national sample of middle schools.; RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that students are exposed to marketing through school devices. Gaps in school district, school and classroom policy and practice lead to student exposure to food and beverage marketing.; CONCLUSIONS: Our data point to actionable policy and practice change at the school district, individual school, and classroom levels that could help limit unwanted and harmful food and beverage marketing to youth. © 2019, American School Health Association.

AB The use of some nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis allows laboratories to adopt single-tiered testing without reflex culture. However, centralization may delay the delivery of actionable information to the bedside, particularly in the outpatient setting. We describe two novel workflows at our institution and their effect on in-lab turnaround time (TAT) at a tertiary care microbiology lab. Laboratory records were extracted, and relevant data were analyzed after the implementation of qualitative in vitro diagnostic testing for GAS with the Xpert Xpress Strep A assay, performed using the GeneXpert Infinity-48s. Workflow optimization steps studied included: (i) direct specimen submission to the microbiology laboratory via the pneumatic tube system and (ii) autoverification of GAS NAAT results in the laboratory information system. Between April 2018 and October 2018, 2,595 unique specimens were tested for GAS by PCR. Of these, 2,523 were included in the final analysis. Linear regression established that the total in-lab TAT was significantly reduced by direct specimen submission to the microbiology laboratory, autoverification, and processing during the night shift. We describe two workflow optimization methods that reduced the in-lab TAT for GAS NAAT. Although microbiology labs historically use manual processes, the advent of total laboratory automation and the adoption of on-demand NAATs will allow for more streamlined processing of microbiology specimens. It may be beneficial to consider instrument interfacing and specimen processing optimization during the early phases of implementation planning for NAATs in the microbiology laboratory.

AB Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rapidly progressed from a research tool to a clinical application for the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis and in public health surveillance. This development has been facilitated by drastic drops in cost, advances in technology and concerted efforts to translate sequencing data into actionable information. There is, however, a risk that, in the absence of a consensus and international standards, the widespread use of WGS technology may result in data and processes that lack harmonization, comparability and validation. In this Review, we outline the current landscape of WGS pipelines and applications, and set out best practices for M. tuberculosis WGS, including standards for bioinformatics pipelines, curated repositories of resistance-causing variants, phylogenetic analyses, quality control and standardized reporting.

AB Background: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and third-most common cancer in both men and women. Colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) rates remain low, particularly among vulnerable patients receiving care at federally qualified health centers. Through its Value Transformation Framework, the National Association of Community Health Centers provides a systematic approach to improving CRCS by transforming health center infrastructure, care delivery, and people systems-to improve health outcomes, patient and staff experiences, and lower costs (Quadruple Aim).; Methods: We combined the Value Transformation Framework, evidence-based CRCS interventions, and the Learning Community Model to drive system improvements and implement evidence-based practices. Multi-disciplinary teams at 8 health centers in Georgia and Iowa participated for 1-year with Primary Care Association support.; Results: Pre-/post- 1-year-intervention data showed, within health centers, raw percentage of eligible patients screened for CRC increased from 33.2% (13.5%-61.7%) in January 2017 to 46.5% (14.2%-81.5%) in December 2017, with an overall 13.3 percentage point average increase. This translates into an average increase of 3.3 (95% CI: 1.7, 5.0) eligible patients screened per month per health center over the year or 317 additional patients meeting CRCS guidelines. Specific interventions associated with higher CRCS rates included standing orders, sharing performance data, and electronic health record alerts.; Conclusion: Findings support a three-pronged approach for improving CRCS: The Value Transformation Framework's evidence-based recommendations, with actionable CRC interventions, offered in a learning community. These results guide methodological approaches to improving CRCS in health centers through a multi-level, multi-modality quality improvement and transformation approach.

AB The abundance of actionable information available in a medicolegal suicide investigation is often inaccessible and underutilized in public health to the detriment of prevention efforts. Epidemiologists obtained the Washington County subset of the Oregon Violent Death Reporting System (OR-VDRS). To determine if additional information beyond the OR-VDRS was available through a standard death investigation, an epidemiologist shadowed medicolegal death investigators (MDIs) for nearly 2 years. The MDIs and epidemiologist developed a novel, real-time, MDI-entered surveillance system, the Suicide Risk Factor Surveillance System (SRFSS), to capture suicide risk factor data with greater timeliness and accuracy than available through the OR-VDRS. To evaluate the performance of each surveillance system, differences in the prevalence of suicide risk factor data from SRFSS were compared with the county OR-VDRS subset for the same 133 suicides occurring in 2014-2015. Across 27 suicide risk factors and circumstances, the median difference in prevalence was 10.5 percentage points between the OR-VDRS and the SRFSS, with the higher prevalence in SRFSS. The prevalence was significantly different between the 2 surveillance systems for 21 (78%) of 27 variables. This study demonstrates the truly exceptional data quality and timeliness of MDI information over traditional sources.

AB We review how FDA surveillance identifies several ways that whole genome sequencing (WGS) improves actionable outcomes for public health and compliance in a case involving Listeria monocytogenes contamination in an ice cream facility. In late August 2017 FDA conducted environmental sampling inside an ice cream facility. These isolates were sequenced and deposited into the GenomeTrakr databases. In September 2018 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contacted the Florida Department of Health after finding that the pathogen analyses of three clinical cases of listeriosis (two in 2013, one in 2018) were highly related to the aforementioned L. monocytogenes isolates collected from the ice cream facility. in 2017. FDA returned to the ice cream facility in late September 2018 and conducted further environmental sampling and again recovered L. monocytogenes from environmental subsamples that were genetically related to the clinical cases. A voluntary recall was issued to include all ice cream manufactured from August 2017 to October 2018. Subsequently, FDA suspended this food facility's registration. WGS results for L. monocytogenes found in the facility and from clinical samples clustered together by 0-31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The FDA worked together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the Florida Department of Health, and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to recall all ice cream products produced by this facility. Our data suggests that when available isolates from food facility inspections are subject to whole genome sequencing and the subsequent sequence data point to linkages between these strains and recent clinical isolates (i.e., <20 nucleotide differences), compliance officials should take regulatory actions early to prevent further potential illness. The utility of WGS for applications related to enforcement of FDA compliance programs in the context of foodborne pathogens is reviewed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe the design, feasibility, and acceptability of a theory-informed obesity and dental caries prevention pilot study, Baby Steps to Health, conducted in an academic dental clinic among a primarily Asian immigrant population.; METHODS: Baby Steps used self-determination theory and behavioral motivation strategies for a caregiver/child (6-36months) nutrition and oral health behavior change intervention implemented in a pediatric dental clinic. Caregivers completed a dietary practice assessment to identify risk behaviors and potential courses of action. With assistance from dental providers, caregiver responses were matched to customized dietary behavioral guidance and a behavior change goal to reinforce caregivers' autonomous motivation to improve feeding practices. A 1-month, post-visit phone caregiver interview assessed adherence to the behavioral goal(s) and solicited qualitative input for further program development.; RESULTS: Fifty caregivers (82 percent Asian) participated in the initial visit, and 46 (92 percent) participated in the follow-up interview. Reported obesogenic/cariogenic risk behaviors were prevalent: 57 percent of bottle-fed children consumed non-water beverages in bottles to aid sleep and 38 percent of parents offered snacks ad libitum. At follow-up, 93 percent of caregivers who selected goals reported positive behavior change and 91 percent said they would participate in a similar future program.; CONCLUSIONS: Tailored guidance delivered in a program that uses self-determination theory may represent a strategic use of the dental encounter to impart actionable information and motivate health-related behavior change for families with very young children. Partnerships between dental and nutrition professionals offer opportunities to address key dietary behaviors that may prevent obesity and improve oral health, particularly among at-risk children. © 2019 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.

AB Achaete-scute homolog 1 gene (ASCL1) is a gene classifier for the proneural (PN) transcriptional subgroup of glioblastoma (GBM) that has a relevant role in the neuronal-like differentiation of GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs) through the activation of a PN gene signature. Besides prototypical ASCL1 PN target genes, the molecular effectors mediating ASCL1 function in regulating GBM differentiation and, most relevantly, subgroup specification are currently unknown. Here we report that ASCL1 not only promotes the acquisition of a PN phenotype in CSCs by inducing a glial-to-neuronal lineage switch but also concomitantly represses mesenchymal (MES) features by directly downregulating the expression of N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which we propose as a novel gene classifier of MES GBMs. Increasing the expression of ASCL1 in PN CSCs results in suppression of self-renewal, promotion of differentiation and, most significantly, decrease in tumorigenesis, which is also reproduced by NDRG1 silencing. Conversely, both abrogation of ASCL1 expression in PN CSCs and enforcement of NDRG1 expression in either PN or MES CSCs induce proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) and enhanced mesenchymal features. Surprisingly, ASCL1 overexpression in MES CSCs increases malignant features and gives rise to a neuroendocrine-like secretory phenotype. Altogether, our results propose that the fine interplay between ASCL1 and its target NDRG1 might serve as potential subgroup-specific targetable vulnerability in GBM; enhancing ASCL1 expression in PN GBMs might reduce tumorigenesis, whereas repressing NDRG1 expression might be actionable to hamper the malignancy of GBM belonging to the MES subgroup.

AB Intimal sarcomas are rare and histologically heterogeneous tumors, commonly arising from the pulmonary arteries. They have remained challenging to treat. Few studies in the literature study the genomics of this cancer. Identifying targetable alterations is an important step in advancing the treatment of intimal sarcomas. Using data from the American Association for Cancer Research Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (AACR GENIE) database, we cataloged genetic alterations and assessed their clinical utility from thirteen patients with intimal sarcoma. Notable copy number alterations included amplification in MDM2, CDK4, PDGFRA, and NOTCH2, as well as copy number losses in CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Actionable alterations included mutations in ATM/ATR, PTCH1, and PDGFRB. Moreover, genomic rearrangement events, specifically PDE4DIP-NOTCH2 and MRPS30-ARID2 fusions were identified. Co-occurring alterations included a NOTCH2 copy number gain in the PDE4DIP-NOTCH2 fusion positive tumor and PDGFRB mutations in both fusion-positive cases. Our study suggests that PDGFRB may be relevant in the tumorigenesis process. Including genomic profiling in the management of intimal sarcoma and potential enrollment in targeted therapy trials is warranted.

AB Since the discovery that DNA alterations initiate tumorigenesis, scientists and clinicians have been exploring ways to counter these changes with targeted therapeutics. The sequencing of tumor DNA was initially limited to highly actionable hot spots-areas of the genome that are frequently altered and have an approved matched therapy in a specific tumor type. Large-scale genome sequencing programs quickly developed technological improvements that enabled the deployment of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing technologies at scale for pristine sample materials in research environments. However, the turning point for precision medicine in oncology was the innovations in clinical laboratories that improved turnaround time, depth of coverage, and the ability to reliably sequence archived, clinically available samples. Today, tumor genome sequencing no longer suffers from significant technical or financial hurdles, and the next opportunity for improvement lies in the optimal utilization of the technologies and data for many different tumor types.

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is a heterogeneous disease. This heterogeneity applies not only to morphological and phenotypic features but also to geographical variations in incidence and mortality rates. As Chile has one of the highest mortality rates within South America, we sought to define a molecular profile of Chilean GCs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03158571/(FORCE1)). Solid tumor samples and clinical data were obtained from 224 patients, with subsets analyzed by tissue microarray (TMA; n = 90) and next generation sequencing (NGS; n = 101). Most demographic and clinical data were in line with previous reports. TMA data indicated that 60% of patients displayed potentially actionable alterations. Furthermore, 20.5% were categorized as having a high tumor mutational burden, and 13% possessed micro-satellite instability (MSI). Results also confirmed previous studies reporting high Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity (13%) in Chilean-derived GC samples suggesting a high proportion of patients could benefit from immunotherapy. As expected, TP53 and PIK3CA were the most frequently altered genes. However, NGS demonstrated the presence of TP53, NRAS, and BRAF variants previously unreported in current GC databases. Finally, using the Kendall method, we report a significant correlation between EBV+ status and programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1)+ and an inverse correlation between p53 mutational status and MSI. Our results suggest that in this Chilean cohort, a high proportion of patients are potential candidates for immunotherapy treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in South America to assess the prevalence of actionable targets and to examine a molecular profile of GC patients.

AB Importance: For findings from clinical trials to be actionable, outcomes measured in trials must be fully defined and, when appropriate, defined consistently across trials. Otherwise, it is difficult to compare findings between trials, combine results in meta-analyses, or leverage findings collectively to inform health care decision-making.; Objective: To identify and characterize outcomes specified in ClinicalTrials.gov records for publicly funded clinical trials for 3 high-burden, high-prevalence eye conditions.; Design, Setting, and Participants: ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry of publicly and privately supported clinical studies, was searched on January 31, 2019, for records of clinical trials for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), dry eye, or refractive error. The search was limited to trials funded by the National Eye Institute but did not impose a date restriction. Five elements of a well-specified outcome were extracted from each outcome stated in each record, including the domain, method of measurement, metric, method of aggregation, and time points.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of outcome domains specified for trials for AMD, dry eye, and refractive error and the number of trial records specifying each unique domain.; Results: A total of 49 unique outcome domains specified across 39 records of trials were identified. The median (interquartile range) number of records specifying each unique outcome domain was 1 (1-3), 1.5 (1-2), and 1 (1-1) for AMD, dry eye, and refractive error, respectively. Even when the same domains were registered across multiple trials, the time point, specific metric, and method of aggregation were specified in multiple ways.; Conclusions and Relevance: There were too many outcomes with too little overlap in the sample of trials that were examined. Differences in how outcomes are measured across trials make it difficult to compare results, even for well-established domains, such as visual acuity. To reduce this waste in eye and vision research, the time is ripe for agreeing on what outcomes to measure.

AB BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps that support individuals pursuing health and wellness goals, such as weight management, stress management, smoking cessation, and self-management of chronic conditions have been on the rise. Despite their potential benefits, the use of these tools has been limited, as most users stop using them just after a few times of use. Under this circumstance, achieving the positive outcomes of mHealth apps is less likely.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand continued use of mHealth apps and individuals' decisions related to this behavior.; METHODS: We conducted a qualitative longitudinal study on continued use of mHealth apps. We collected data through 34 pre- and postuse interviews and 193 diaries from 17 participants over two weeks.; RESULTS: We identified 2 dimensions that help explain continued use decisions of users of mHealth apps: users' assessment of mHealth app and its capabilities (user experience) and their persistence at their health goals (intent). We present the key factors that influence users' assessment of an mHealth app (interface design, navigation, notifications, data collection methods and tools, goal management, depth of knowledge, system rules, actionable recommendations, and user system fit) and relate these factors to previous literature on behavior change technology design. Using these 2 dimensions, we developed a framework that illustrated 4 decisions users might make after initial interaction with mHealth apps (to abandon use, limit use, switch app, and continue use). We put forth propositions to be explored in future research on mHealth app use.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the factors that shape users' decisions to continue using mHealth apps, as well as other likely decision scenarios after the initial use experience. The findings contribute to extant knowledge of mHealth use and provide important implications for design of mHealth apps to increase long-term engagement of the users. ©Isaac Vaghefi, Bengisu Tulu.

AB Cancer precision medicine aims to predict the drug likely to yield the best response for a patient. Genomic sequencing of tumors is currently being used to better inform treatment options; however, this approach has had a limited clinical impact due to the paucity of actionable mutations. An alternative to mutation status is the use of gene expression signatures to predict response. Using data from two large-scale studies, The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity of Cancer (GDSC) and The Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP), we investigated the relationship between the sensitivity of hundreds of cell lines to hundreds of drugs, and the relative expression levels of the targets these drugs are directed against. For approximately one third of the drugs considered (73/222 in GDSC and 131/360 in CTRP), sensitivity was significantly correlated with the expression of at least one of the known targets. Surprisingly, for 8% of the annotated targets, there was a significant anticorrelation between target expression and sensitivity. For several cases, this corresponded to drugs targeting multiple genes in the same family, with the expression of one target significantly correlated with sensitivity and another significantly anticorrelated suggesting a possible role in resistance. Furthermore, we identified nontarget genes that are significantly correlated or anticorrelated with drug sensitivity, and find literature linking several to sensitization and resistance. Our analyses provide novel and important insights into both potential mechanisms of resistance and relative efficacy of drugs against the same target. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB Cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for ATP production even in aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) and adapt mitochondrial processes to their specific needs. Recent studies indicate that altered mitochondrial activities in cancer represent an actionable target for therapy. We previously showed that salt 1-3C, a quinoxaline unit (with cytotoxic activity) incorporated into a meso-substituted pentamethinium salt (with mitochondrial selectivity and fluorescence properties), displayed potent cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo, without significant toxic effects to normal tissues. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of salt 1-3C compared to its analogue, salt 1-8C, with an extended side carbon chain. Live cell imaging demonstrated that salt 1-3C, but not 1-8C, is rapidly incorporated into mitochondria, correlating with increased cytotoxicity of salt 1-3C. The accumulation in mitochondria led to their fragmentation and loss of function, accompanied by increased autophagy/mitophagy. Salt 1-3C preferentially activated AMP-activated kinase and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, sensors of cellular metabolism, but did not induce apoptosis. These data indicate that salt 1-3C cytotoxicity involves mitochondrial perturbation and disintegration, and such compounds are promising candidates for targeting mitochondria as a weak spot of cancer.

AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune syndrome of unknown etiology, characterized by multi-organ inflammation and clinical heterogeneity. SLE affects mostly women and is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. As the therapeutic management of SLE improved, a pattern of early atherosclerotic disease became one of the hallmarks of late disease morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils emerged as important players in SLE pathogenesis and they are associated with increased risk of developing atherosclerotic disease and vascular damage. Enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation was linked to vasculopathy in both SLE and non-SLE subjects and may promote enhanced coronary plaque formation and lipoprotein dysregulation. Foundational work provided insight into the complex relationship between NETs and immune and tissue resident cells within the diseased artery. In this review, we highlight the mechanistic link between neutrophils, NETs, and atherosclerosis within the context of both SLE and non-SLE subjects. We aim to identify actionable pathways that will drive future research toward translational therapeutics, with the ultimate goal of preventing early morbidity and mortality in SLE.

AB Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of pancreatic cancer at a mechanistic and translational level. Genetic concepts and tools are increasingly starting to be applied to clinical practice, in particular for precision medicine efforts. However, epigenomics is rapidly emerging as a promising conceptual and methodological paradigm for advancing the knowledge of this disease. More importantly, recent studies have uncovered potentially actionable pathways, which support the prediction that future trials for pancreatic cancer will involve the vigorous testing of epigenomic therapeutics. Thus, epigenomics promises to generate a significant amount of new knowledge of both biological and medical importance.

AB Chordomas are rare primary malignant tumors of the bones that occur along the skull base, spine, and sacrum. Long-term survival and neurological outcome continue to be challenging with continued low percentages of long-term survival. Recent studies have used genome, exome, transcriptome, and proteome sequencing to assess the mutational profile of chordomas. Most notably, Brachyury, or T-protein, has been shown to be an early mutational event in chordoma evolution. Clinically actionable mutations, including in the PI3K pathway, were identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that there may be mutational differences associated with primary tumor location. In this study, we review the therapeutic landscape of chordomas and discuss emerging targets in the genomic era. Copyright © 2019 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

AB PURPOSE: The majority of broad-panel tumor genomic profiling has used a gene-centric approach, although much of that data is unused in clinical decision making. We hypothesized that a pathway-centric approach using next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with conventional clinicopathologic features, may better predict disease-free survival (DFS) in early stage lung adenocarcinoma.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Utilizing our prospectively maintained database, we analyzed 492 patients with primary, untreated, completely surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma. Ten canonical pathways were analyzed using broad-panel NGS. The correlations of DFS and number (and type) of pathway (NPA) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Associations between altered pathways and clinicopathologic variables, as well as identification of actionable therapeutic strategies were explored.; RESULTS: Median NPA for the cohort was two (range, 0-5). Smoking status, solid morphologic appearance on preoperative CT, maximal standardized uptake value, pathologic tumor size, aggressive histologic subtype, lymphovascular invasion, visceral pleural invasion, and positive lymph nodes were significantly associated with NPA (P < 0.05). Of 543 actionable genetic alterations identified, 455 (84%) were within the RTK/RAS pathway. A total of 86 tumors had actionable therapeutic genomic alterations in >1 pathway. On multivariable analysis, higher NPA was significantly associated with worse DFS (HR, 1.31; P = 0.014).; CONCLUSIONS: NPA and specific pathway alterations are associated with clinicopathologic features in patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma. Cell cycle, Hippo, TGFbeta, and p53 pathway alterations are associated with poor DFS. Finally, NPA is an independent risk factor for poor DFS in our cohort. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB INTRODUCTION: In 2010, experts in osteoporosis and bone densitometry were convened by the Space Life Sciences Directorate at NASA Johnson Space Center to identify a skeletal outcome in astronauts after spaceflight that would require a clinical response to address fracture risk. After reviewing astronaut data, experts expressed concern over discordant patterns in loss and recovery of bone mineral density (BMD) after spaceflight as monitored by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT). The pilot study described herein demonstrates the use of QCT to evaluate absence of recovery in hip trabecular BMD by QCT as an indicator of a clinically actionable response.; METHODOLOGY: QCT and DXA scans of both hips were performed on 10 astronauts: once preflight and twice postflight about 1 wk and 1 yr after return. If trabecular BMD had not returned to baseline (i.e., within QCT measurement error) in 1 or both hips 1 yr after flight, then another QCT hip scan was obtained at 2 yr after flight.; RESULTS: Areal BMD by DXA recovered in 9 of 10 astronauts at 1 yr postflight while incomplete recovery of trabecular BMD by QCT was evident in 5 of 10 astronauts and persisted in 4 of the 5 astronauts 2 yr postflight.; CONCLUSION: As an adjunct to DXA, QCT is needed to detect changes to hip trabecular BMD after spaceflight and to confirm complete recovery. Incomplete recovery at 2 yr should trigger the need for further evaluation and possible intervention to mitigate premature fragility and fractures in astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.

AB BACKGROUND: The quality of life of people living with chronic conditions is highly dependent on self-management behaviors. Mobile health (mHealth) apps could facilitate self-management and thus help improve population health. To achieve their potential, apps need to target specific behaviors with appropriate techniques that support change and do so in a way that allows users to understand and act upon the content with which they interact.; OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify apps targeted toward the self-management of chronic conditions and that are available in France. We aimed to examine what target behaviors and behavior change techniques (BCTs) they include, their level of understandability and actionability, and the associations between these characteristics.; METHODS: We extracted data from the Google Play store on apps labelled as Top in the Medicine category. We also extracted data on apps that were found through 12 popular terms (ie, keywords) for the four most common chronic condition groups-cardiovascular diseases, cancers, respiratory diseases, and diabetes-along with apps identified through a literature search. We selected and downloaded native Android apps available in French for the self-management of any chronic condition in one of the four groups and extracted background characteristics (eg, stars and number of ratings), coded the presence of target behaviors and BCTs using the BCT taxonomy, and coded the understandability and actionability of apps using the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool for audiovisual materials (PEMAT-A/V). We performed descriptive statistics and bivariate statistical tests.; RESULTS: A total of 44 distinct native apps were available for download in France and in French: 39 (89%) were found via the Google Play store and 5 (11%) were found via literature search. A total of 19 (43%) apps were for diabetes, 10 for cardiovascular diseases (23%), 8 for more than one condition in the four groups (18%), 6 for respiratory diseases (14%), and 1 for cancer (2%). The median number of target behaviors per app was 2 (range 0-7) and of BCTs per app was 3 (range 0-12). The most common BCT was self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behavior (31 apps), while the most common target behavior was tracking symptoms (30 apps). The median level of understandability was 42% and of actionability was 0%. Apps with more target behaviors and more BCTs were also more understandable (rho=.31, P=.04 and rho=.35, P=.02, respectively), but were not significantly more actionable (rho=.24, P=.12 and rho=.29, P=.054, respectively).; CONCLUSIONS: These apps target few behaviors and include few BCTs, limiting their potential for behavior change. While content is moderately understandable, clear instructions on when and how to act are uncommon. Developers need to work closely with health professionals, users, and behavior change experts to improve content and format so apps can better support patients in coping with chronic conditions. Developers may use these criteria for assessing content and format to guide app development and evaluation of app performance.; TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42018094012; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=94012. ©Luiza Siqueira do Prado, Camille Carpentier, Marie Preau, Anne-Marie Schott, Alexandra Lelia Dima.

AB AIM: To measure the association between the nurse work environment (NWE) and missed nursing care on labour and delivery (L&D) units.; BACKGROUND: L&D units provide a sizable fraction of acute hospital services to a unique population that is a national and global priority. L&D nurses are the frontline providers during labour. Maternal morbidity and mortality may be influenced by the NWE and missed care.; METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from 1,313 L&D staff nurses in 247 hospitals from a four-state nurse survey collected in 2005-2008.; RESULTS: Half of nurses missed care (range: zero to 100% across hospitals). Nurses on average missed 1.25 of 10 activities. The most commonly missed activities were comforting/talking with patients and teaching/counselling. In better as compared to poor NWEs, the odds and frequency of missed care were significantly lower.; CONCLUSIONS: L&D nurses routinely miss necessary nursing activities. Labouring women's psychosocial, comfort and educational needs are compromised most often, likely impacting quality and outcomes. Nurse communication with colleagues and managers about missed care is warranted.; IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The L&D NWE is modifiable and appears to influence missed care. Managers should discuss missed care with staff and measure their NWE to identify actionable weaknesses. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Endometriosis is a chronic, multifocal disease, which can lead to pain or subfertility. Treatments are tailored toward the therapeutic goals of the individual patient; either to improve a specific pain symptom or optimize fertility. Management of endometriosis is complex, and best implemented by a comprehensive, multidisciplinary team of physicians and health care providers. The role of the radiologist in the management of endometriosis is becoming increasingly important as more centers move toward utilizing female pelvic MR studies to diagnose, delineate or follow endometriosis lesions. The radiologist must communicate pertinent, actionable findings from these studies in a manner that is clear and concise. Structured radiologic reports (SRR) add value in that they provide organized, clear, and comprehensive information from imaging studies, ensuring reports include essential items required for decision-making. In this paper, we review our MR imaging protocol and present the structured radiologic report implemented at our institution by our multidisciplinary endometriosis care team. Imaging features of endometriosis at each site specified in the structured report are summarized.

AB We investigate the capability of information from electronic health records of an emergency department (ED) to predict patient disposition decisions for reducing "boarding" delays through the proactive initiation of admission processes (e.g., inpatient bed requests, transport, etc.). We model the process of ED disposition decision prediction as a hierarchical multiclass classification while dealing with the progressive accrual of clinical information throughout the ED caregiving process. Multinomial logistic regression as well as machine learning models are built for carrying out the predictions. Utilizing results from just the first set of ED laboratory tests along with other prior information gathered for each patient (2.5h ahead of the actual disposition decision on average), our model predicts disposition decisions with positive predictive values of 55.4%, 45.1%, 56.9%, and 47.5%, while controlling false positive rates (1.4%, 1.0%, 4.3%, and 1.4%), with AUC values of 0.97, 0.95, 0.89, and 0.84 for the four admission (minor) classes, i.e., intensive care unit (3.6% of the testing samples), telemetry unit (2.2%), general practice unit (11.9%), and observation unit (6.6%) classes, respectively. Moreover, patients destined to intensive care unit present a more drastic increment in prediction quality at triage than others. Disposition decision classification models can provide more actionable information than a binary admission vs. discharge prediction model for the proactive initiation of admission processes for ED patients. Observing the distinct trajectories of information accrual and prediction quality evolvement for ED patients destined to different types of units, proactive coordination strategies should be tailored accordingly for each destination unit.

AB Acquired resistance to targeted cancer therapy is a significant clinical challenge. In parallel with clinical trials combining CDK4/6 inhibitors to treat HER2+breast cancer, we sought to prospectively model tumor evolution in response to this regimen in vivo and identify a clinically actionable strategy to combat drugresistance. Despite a promising initial response, acquired resistance emerges rapidly to thecombination of anti-HER2/neu antibody and CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Using high-throughput single-cell profiling over the course of treatments, we reveal a distinct immunosuppressive immature myeloid cell (IMC) population toinfiltrate the resistant tumors. Guided by single-cell transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate thatcombination of IMC-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib and immune checkpoint blockade enhances anti-tumor immunity, and overcomes the resistance. Furthermore, sequential combinatorial immunotherapy enables a sustained control of the fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant tumors. Our study demonstrates a translational framework for treating rapidly evolving tumors through preclinical modeling and single-cell analyses.

AB Identification of targetable molecular changes is essential for selecting appropriate treatment in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: In this study, a Sanger sequencing plus Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) sequential approach was compared with a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based approach for the detection of actionable genomic mutations in an experimental cohort (EC) of 117 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Its applicability was assessed in small biopsies and cytology specimens previously tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutational status, comparing the molecular changes identified and the impact on clinical outcomes. Subsequently, an NGS-based approach was applied and tested in an implementation cohort (IC) in clinical practice. Using Sanger and FISH, patients were classified as EGFR-mutated (n = 22, 18.8%), ALK-mutated (n = 9, 7.7%), and unclassifiable (UC) (n = 86, 73.5%). Retesting the EC with NGS led to the identification of at least one gene variant in 56 (47.9%) patients, totaling 68 variants among all samples. Still, in the EC, combining NGS plus FISH for ALK, patients were classified as 23 (19.7%) EGFR; 20 (17.1%) KRAS; five (4.3%) B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF); one (0.9%) Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2 (ERBB2); one (0.9%) STK11; one (0.9%) TP53, and nine (7.7%) ALK mutated. Only 57 (48.7%) remained genomically UC, reducing the UC rate by 24.8%. Fourteen (12.0%) patients presented synchronous alterations. Concordance between NGS and Sanger for EGFR status was very high (kappa = 0.972; 99.1%). In the IC, a combined DNA and RNA NGS panel was used in 123 patients. Genomic variants were found in 79 (64.2%). In addition, eight (6.3%) EML4-ALK, four (3.1%), KIF5B-RET, four (3.1%) CD74-ROS1, one (0.8%) TPM3-NTRK translocations and three (2.4%) exon 14 skipping MET Proto-Oncogene (MET) mutations were detected, and 36% were treatable alterations. Conclusions: This study supports the use of NGS as the first-line test for genomic profiling of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Selection of specific patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for cancer patients requires careful consideration to the purpose and population at aim. Here we report the process of choosing which items to include in a bladder cancer population in chemo- or immunotherapy based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).; METHODS: Initial PRO-CTCAE symptoms were chosen through 1) medical record audit 2) patient interviews 3) summary of product characteristics from European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration for the applied chemotherapies, and 4) toxicity reporting from Phase 2 and 3 trials for immunotherapies applied in patients with urothelial cancer. The selected questions were applied in a prospective cohort of 78 bladder cancer patients receiving chemo- or immunotherapy at Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital, Denmark. Symptoms tested in this population were selected for the final module if they appeared in ≥3 of the following groupings a) the most prevalent PRO-CTCAE symptoms grade≥2 overall during treatment b) the PRO-CTCAE symptoms reported in conjunction with hospital admissions or mentioned in focus group interviews discussing which symptoms were prevalent in this patient group with specialized c) nurses or d) physicians. The authors also included symptoms in the final module if they were present in two of the above groups and defined as actionable by clinicians.; RESULTS: From the initial selection of PRO-CTCAE symptoms, a total of 45 PRO-CTCAE symptoms explored by 84 PRO-CTCAE questions were retrieved. Through the second selection process based on the described criteria, the study group agreed on 15 PRO-CTCAE symptoms explored by 30 PRO-CTCAE items to be appropriate and relevant for the bladder population during medical oncological treatment.; CONCLUSIONS: The selection of disease specific PROs in a bladder cancer population was feasible. The process revealed several steps of selection needed in order to reach a final module for clinical application.

AB YAP/TEAD are nuclear effectors of the Hippo pathway, regulating organ size and tumorigenesis largely through promoter-associated function. However, their function as enhancer regulators remains poorly understood. Through an invivo proximity-dependent labeling (BioID) technique, we identified YAP1 and TEAD4 protein as co-regulators of ERalpha on enhancers. The binding of YAP1/TEAD4 to ERalpha-bound enhancers is augmented upon E2 stimulation and is required for the induction of E2/ERalpha target genes and E2-induced oncogenic cell growth. Furthermore, their enhancer binding is a prerequisite for enhancer activation marked by eRNA transcription and for the recruitment of the enhancer activation machinery component MED1. The binding of TEAD4 on active ERE-containing enhancers is independent of its DNA-binding behavior, and instead, occurs through protein-tethering trans-binding. Our data reveal a non-canonical function of YAP1 and TEAD4 as ERalpha cofactors in regulating cancer growth, highlighting the potential of YAP/TEAD as possible actionable drug targets for ERalpha+ breast cancer.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the external validity of the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) score decision tool in real world patients.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective study using an all comers PCI registry. We compared the rates of myocardial infarction (MI) and actionable bleeding between 12 vs. 12+ months DAPT stratified by DAPT score category. Of 12,162 patients, 4471 (36.8%) completed a year of DAPT without events. The high DAPT score stratum patients were older and had a higher comorbidity burden. Overall, 12+ months DAPT duration was associated with reduced rates of MI (2.8% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.025) and similar rates of bleeding (2.6% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.281) compared to 12 months DAPT, but when stratified by DAPT score stratum, there was no difference in any of the outcomes in both high score group, (3.7% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.111 and 2.0% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.800, for MI and bleeding, respectively) and low score patients (2.7% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.656 and 2.8% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.308, for MI and bleeding, respectively). Overall clinical events (MI + bleeding) was again similar between patients treated with 12+ vs. 12 months DAPT (5.5% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.535 and 5.1% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.503 for high and low DAPT score, respectively).; CONCLUSIONS: for real world patients completing 1 year of DAPT post PCI, rates of MI, actionable bleeding, and their combination did not differ between those treated with 12+ vs. 12 months DAPT stratified by DAPT score stratum. Clinicians should be aware of the DAPT score's limitations. Further studies examining the validity of the DAPT score in larger cohorts are required. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Potential drug-drug interactions (PDDI) rules are currently represented without any common standard making them difficult to update, maintain, and exchange. The PDDI minimum information model developed by the Semantic Web in the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Group describes PDDI knowledge in an actionable format. In this paper, we report implementation and evaluation of CDS Services which represent PDDI knowledge with Clinical Quality Language (CQL). The suggested solution is based on emerging standards including CDS Hooks, FHIR, and CQL. Two use cases are selected, implemented with CQL rules and tested at the Connectathon held at the 32nd Annual Plenary & Working Group Meeting of HL7.

AB Home health care admission nurses need high quality patient information but that information is not uniformly available. Despite this challenge, these nurses must make four critical decisions at patient admission to construct the plan of care: (1) patient problems to address in the home health care episode; (2) patient medication management; (3) services in addition to skilled nursing; and (4) skilled nursing visit pattern. We observed 12 in-home admissions at a rural home health care agency and interviewed nurses before and after about these decisions. We analyzed content and quality of documents. To evaluate quality, for each decision we assessed concordance between documents. Interview responses provided context in the analysis. Across all admissions, documents and their contents were not uniformly present. Nurses rarely received visit pattern or medication management information. There was discordance in the number of patient problems among and between available documents and the plan of care. Electronic health record design recommendations include interoperability and structured, consistent, actionable information.

AB Clinical data, such as laboratory test results, is increasingly being made available to patients through patient portals. However, patients often have difficulties understanding and acting upon the clinical data presented in portals. As such, many turn to online resources to fill their knowledge gaps and obtain actionable advice. In this work, we present a content analysis of the questions posted in a major social Q&A site to characterize lay people's general information needs concerning laboratory test results and to inform the design of patient portals for supporting patients' understanding of clinical data. We identified 15 information needs related to laboratory test results, and clustered them under four themes: understanding the results of lab test, interpreting doctor's diagnosis, learning about lab tests, and consulting the next steps. We draw on our findings to discuss design opportunities for supporting the understanding of laboratory results.

AB Next-generation sequencing has prompted the development of numerous -omics applications. Along with experimental procedures, various computational pipelines became available to address the inherent complexities concerning the volume and quality of data. These pipelines are effective and routinely applied; however, interpreting their outcomes into actionable evidence is still poorly addressed. In this context, this work proposes a method for translating patient genomic profiles to drug response aberrations by integrating pharmacogenomic data into sequencing data analysis pipelines.

AB Molecular clocks are present in almost every cell to anticipate daily recurring and predictable changes, such as rhythmic nutrient availability, and to adapt cellular functions accordingly. At the same time, nutrient-sensing pathways can respond to acute nutrient imbalance and modulate and orient metabolism so cells can adapt optimally to a declining or increasing availability of nutrients. Organismal circadian rhythms are coordinated by behavioral rhythms such as activity-rest and feeding-fasting cycles to temporally orchestrate a sequence of physiological processes to optimize metabolism. Basic research in circadian rhythms has largely focused on the functioning of the self-sustaining molecular circadian oscillator, while research in nutrition science has yielded insights into physiological responses to caloric deprivation or to specific macronutrients. Integration of these two fields into actionable new concepts in the timing of food intake has led to the emerging practice of time-restricted eating. In this paradigm, daily caloric intake is restricted to a consistent window of 8-12 h. This paradigm has pervasive benefits on multiple organ systems.

AB The thermal performance of green roofs is usually site-specific and changes temporally. Hence, thermal performance evaluation is necessary to optimize green roof design and its cooling effect. In this paper, we evaluated the outdoor spatio-temporal performance of a full-scale extensive green roof (EGR) in Nanjing, China throughout a summer at three heights (30, 60and 120cm). We found the EGR exhibited an overall slight diurnal cooling effect at all three heights (-0.09, -0.23, and - 0.09 °C, respectively), but there was an obvious warming effect at a couple of specific hours during daytime. Especially on sunny days, the maximum warming effect at all three heights was 1.59, 0.59, and 0.38 °C, respectively. During the night, the EGR had a pronounced cooling effect of -0.63, -0.40, and - 0.15 °C, respectively. Among the weather scenarios, sunny days had the highest impact on the EGR's thermal performance, while effects were less pronounced on cloudy and rainy days. The average range of hourly air temperature difference at 30 cm between EGR and a bare roof on selected days was 4.02 (sunny), 2.67 (cloudy), and 0.74 °C (rainy). The results of multiple-regression analyses showed strong and significant correlations of air temperature difference between the EGR and a bare roof with differences in relative humidity, net radiation, several measures of soil and surface temperature, and soil moisture as well as average solar radiation, air temperature and wind speed. The results implied that both the components of the EGR, such as green vegetation and the soil substrate layer, and the microclimate created by the EGR can feed back and contribute to the thermal performance of an EGR. Through this full-scale EGR research in a subtropical monsoon climate, we provide the scientific basis and actionable practices for green roof planning and design to alleviate the urban heat island effect towards designing climate-resilient cities.

AB Childhood obesity is a global public health concern in developed and developing countries. Approximately 3 in 10 Panamanian children suffer from obesity, and overweight/obesity is responsible for the highest number of premature or avoidable deaths in this country. A formative community assessment and exploration of the built food environment was conducted. Analysis suggests that almost one-third of the children measured were overweight or obese, and the availability of foods recommended for optimal health is limited in this community. Actionable recommendations for intervention and future collaboration were provided, and stakeholders from all groups will continue to explore opportunities.

AB Quantitative Investment, built on the solid foundation of robust financial theories, is at the center stage in investment industry today. The essence of quantitative investment is the multi-factor model, which explains the relationship between the risk and return of equities. However, the multi-factor model generates enormous quantities of factor data, through which even experienced portfolio managers find it difficult to navigate. This has led to portfolio analysis and factor research being limited by a lack of intuitive visual analytics tools. Previous portfolio visualization systems have mainly focused on the relationship between the portfolio return and stock holdings, which is insufficient for making actionable insights or understanding market trends. In this paper, we present sPortfolio, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first visualization that attempts to explore the factor investment area. In particular, sPortfolio provides a holistic overview of the factor data and aims to facilitate the analysis at three different levels: a Risk-Factor level, for a general market situation analysis; a Multiple-Portfolio level, for understanding the portfolio strategies; and a Single-Portfolio level, for investigating detailed operations. The system's effectiveness and usability are demonstrated through three case studies. The system has passed its pilot study and is soon to be deployed in industry.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport.; METHODS: Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation.; KEY RESULTS: At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10% greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection.; CONCLUSIONS: We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB The establishment of precision medicine in cancer patients requires the study of several biomarkers. Single-gene testing approaches are limited by sample availability and turnaround time. Next generation sequencing (NGS) provides an alternative for detecting genetic alterations in several genes with low sample requirements. Here we show the implementation to routine diagnostics of a NGS assay under International Organization for Standardization (UNE-EN ISO 15189:2013) accreditation. For this purpose, 106 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 102 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) specimens were selected for NGS analysis with Oncomine Solid Tumor (ThermoFisher). In NSCLC the most prevalently mutated gene was TP53 (49%), followed by KRAS (31%) and EGFR (13%); in mCRC, TP53 (50%), KRAS (48%) and PIK3CA (16%) were the most frequently mutated genes. Moreover, NGS identified actionable genetic alterations in 58% of NSCLC patients, and 49% of mCRC patients did not harbor primary resistance mechanisms to anti-EGFR treatment. Validation with conventional approaches showed an overall agreement >90%. Turnaround time and cost analysis revealed that NGS implementation is feasible in the public healthcare context. Therefore, NGS is a multiplexed molecular diagnostic tool able to overcome the limitations of current molecular diagnosis in advanced cancer, allowing an improved and economically sustainable molecular profiling.

AB Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections result in a considerable underappreciated burden of acute and chronic disease globally. A 2018 World Health Assembly resolution calls for better control and prevention. Providing guidance on global health research needs is an important World Health Organization (WHO) activity, influencing prioritization of investments. Here, the role, status, and directions in GAS vaccines research are discussed. WHO preferred product characteristics and a research and development technology roadmap, briefly presented, offer an actionable framework for vaccine development to regulatory and policy decision making, availability, and use. GAS vaccines should be considered for global prevention of the range of clinical manifestations and associated antibiotic use. Impediments related to antigen diversity, safety concerns, and the difficulty to establish vaccine efficacy against rheumatic heart disease are discussed. Demonstration of vaccine efficacy against pharyngitis and skin infections constitutes a key near-term strategic goal. Investments and collaborative partnerships to diversify and advance vaccine candidates are needed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB Conventional skin and blood sampling techniques for disease diagnosis, though effective, are often highly invasive and some even suffer from variations in analysis. With the improvements in molecular detection, the amount of starting sample quantity needed has significantly reduced in some diagnostic procedures, and this has led to an increased interest in microsampling techniques for disease biomarker detection. The miniaturization of sampling platforms driven by microsampling has the potential to shift disease diagnosis and monitoring closer to the point of care. The faster turnaround time for actionable results has improved patient care. The variations in sample quantification and analysis remain a challenge in the microsampling field. The future of microsampling looks promising. Emerging techniques are being clinically tested and monitored by regulatory bodies. This process is leading to safer and more reliable diagnostic platforms. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of current skin and blood microsampling techniques.

AB Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are incurable brain tumors with an aggressive onset. Apart from irradiation, there are currently no effective therapies available for patients with DIPG, who have a median survival time of less than one year. Most DIPG cells harbor mutations in genes encoding histone H3 (H3K27M) proteins, resulting in a global reduction of H3K27 trimethylation and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Here we show that the H3K27M mutations contribute to RAS pathway signaling, which is augmented by additional RAS activators including PDGFRA. H3K27M mutation led to increased expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). A RAS pathway functional screen identified ERK5, but not ERK1/2, as a RAS pathway effector important for DIPG growth. Suppression of ERK5 decreased DIPG cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, depletion or inhibition of ERK5 significantly increased survival of mice intracranially engrafted with DIPG cells. Mechanistically, ERK5 directly stabilized the proto-oncogene MYC at the protein level. Collectively, our data demonstrate an underappreciated role of H3K27M in RAS activation and reveal novel therapeutic targets for treating DIPG tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify the H3K27M mutation as an enhancer of RAS activation in DIPG and ERK5 as a novel, immediately actionable molecular target.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease that lacks clinically actionable genetic alterations that limit targeted therapies. Here we explore a systems pharmacology approach that integrates drug-target networks andlarge-scale genomic profiles of TNBC and identify wogonoside, one of the major active flavonoids, as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. Wevalidate that wogonoside attenuates cell migration, tube formation, and rat aorta microvessel outgrowth, and reduces formation of blood vessels in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and TNBC cell-induced Matrigel plugs. In addition, wogonoside inhibits growth and angiogenesis in TNBC cell xenograft models. This network-based approach predicts, and we empirically validate, wogonoside's antiangiogenic effects resulting from vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Mechanistically, wogonoside inhibits Gli1 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities associated with Hedgehog signaling, by promoting Smoothened degradation in a proteasome-dependent mechanism. This study offers a powerful, integrated, systems pharmacology-based strategy for oncological drug discovery and identifies wogonoside as a potential TNBC angiogenesis inhibitor.

AB PURPOSE: NRG1 gene fusions are rare but potentially actionable oncogenic drivers that are present in some solid tumors. Details regarding the incidence of these gene rearrangements are lacking. Here, we assessed the incidence of NRG1 fusions across multiple tumor types and described fusion partners.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor specimens submitted for molecular profiling at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified genomics laboratory and that underwent fusion testing by anchored multiplex PCR for targeted RNA sequencing were retrospectively identified. The overall and tumor-specific incidence was noted, as was the specific fusion partner.; RESULTS: Out of 21,858 tumor specimens profiled from September 2015 to December 2018, 41 cases (0.2%) harbored an NRG1 fusion. Multiple fusion partners were identified. Fusion events were seen across tumor types. The greatest incidence was in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 25), though this represented only 0.3% of NSCLC cases tested. Other tumor types harboring an NRG1 fusion included gallbladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, sarcoma, and colorectal cancer.; CONCLUSIONS: NRG1 fusions can be detected at a low incidence across multiple tumor types with significant heterogeneity in fusion partner.See related commentary by Dimou and Camidge, p. 4865. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB MOTIVATION: Advancements in cancer genetics have facilitated the development of therapies with actionable mutations. Although mutated genes have been studied extensively, their chaotic behavior has not been appreciated. Thus, in contrast to naive DNA, mutated DNA sequences can display characteristics of unpredictability and sensitivity to the initial conditions that may be dictated by the environment, expression patterns and presence of other genomic alterations. Employing a DNA walk as a form of 2D analysis of the nucleotide sequence, we demonstrate that chaotic behavior in the sequence of a mutated gene can be predicted.; RESULTS: Using fractal analysis for these DNA walks, we have determined the complexity and nucleotide variance of commonly observed mutated genes in non-small cell lung cancer, and their wild-type counterparts. DNA walks for wild-type genes demonstrate varying levels of chaos, with BRAF, NTRK1 and MET exhibiting greater levels of chaos than KRAS, paxillin and EGFR. Analyzing changes in chaotic properties, such as changes in periodicity and linearity, reveal that while deletion mutations indicate a notable disruption in fractal 'self-similarity', fusion mutations demonstrate bifurcations between the two genes. Our results suggest that the fractals generated by DNA walks can yield important insights into potential consequences of these mutated genes.; AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Introduction to Turtle graphics in Python is an open source article on learning to develop a script for Turtle graphics in Python, freely available on the web at https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html. cDNA sequences were obtained through NCBI RefSeq database, an open source database that contains information on a large array of genes, such as their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, freely available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/.

AB In the smart environments we live today, a great variety of heterogeneous sensors are being increasingly deployed with the aim of providing more and more value-added services. This huge availability of sensor data, together with emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for Big Data analytics, can yield a wide array of actionable insights to help older adults continue to live independently with minimal support of caregivers. In this regard, there is a growing demand for technological solutions able to monitor human activities and vital signs in order to early detect abnormal conditions, avoiding the caregivers' daily check of the care recipient. The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art machine and deep learning techniques suitable for detecting early changes in human behavior. At this purpose, specific synthetic data are generated, including activities of daily living, home locations in which such activities take place, and vital signs. The achieved results demonstrate the superiority of unsupervised deep-learning techniques over traditional supervised/semi-supervised ones in terms of detection accuracy and lead-time of prediction.

AB Tennis players and coaches of all proficiency levels seek to understand and improve their play. Summary statistics alone are inadequate to provide the insights players need to improve their games. Spatio-temporal data capturing player and ball movements is likely to provide the actionable insights needed to identify player strengths, weaknesses, and strategies. To fully utilize this spatio-temporal data, we need to integrate it with domain-relevant context meta-data. In this paper, we propose CourtTime, a novel approach to perform data-driven visual analysis of individual tennis matches. Our visual approach introduces a novel visual metaphor, namely 1-D Space-Time Charts that enable the analysis of single points at a glance based on small multiples. We also employ user-driven sorting and clustering techniques and a layout technique that aligns the last few shots in a point to facilitate shot pattern discovery. We discuss the usefulness of CourtTime via an extensive case study and report on feedback from an amateur tennis player and three tennis coaches.

AB At initial diagnosis, most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) present with metastatic disease with a high number of tumor cells (CTCs) circulating in the blood. We analyzed RNA transcripts specific for neuroendocrine and for epithelial cell lineages, and Notch pathway delta-like 3 ligand (DLL3), the actionable target of rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) in CTC samples. Peripheral blood samples from 48 SCLC patients were processed using the microfluidic Parsortix technology to enrich the CTCs. Blood samples from 26 healthy donors processed in the same way served as negative controls. The isolated cells were analyzed for the presence of above-mentioned transcripts using quantitative PCR. In total, 16/51 (31.4%) samples were CTC-positive as determined by the expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (EpCAM), cytokeratin 19 (CK19), chromogranin A (CHGA), and/or synaptophysis (SYP). The epithelial cell lineage-specific EpCAM and/or CK19 gene expression was observed in 11 (21.6%) samples, and positivity was not associated with impaired survival. The neuroendocrine cell lineage-specific CHGA and/or SYP were positive in 13 (25.5%) samples, and positivity was associated with poor overall survival. DLL3 transcripts were observed in four (7.8%) SCLC blood samples and DLL3-positivity was similarly associated with poor overall survival (OS). CTCs in SCLC patients can be assessed using epithelial and neuroendocrine cell lineage markers at the molecular level. Thus, the implementation of liquid biopsy may improve the management of lung cancer patients, in terms of a faster diagnosis, patient stratification, and on-treatment therapy monitoring.

AB PURPOSE: Despite the rapid uptake of multigene panel testing (MGPT) for hereditary cancer predisposition, there is limited guidance surrounding indications for testing and genes to include.; METHODS: To inform the clinical approach to hereditary cancer MGPT, we comprehensively evaluated 32 cancer predisposition genes by assessing phenotype-specific pathogenic variant (PV) frequencies, cancer risk associations, and performance of genetic testing criteria in a cohort of 165,000 patients referred for MGPT.; RESULTS: We identified extensive genetic heterogeneity surrounding predisposition to cancer types commonly referred for germline testing (breast, ovarian, colorectal, uterine/endometrial, pancreatic, and melanoma). PV frequencies were highest among patients with ovarian cancer (13.8%) and lowest among patients with melanoma (8.1%). Fewer than half of PVs identified in patients meeting testing criteria for only BRCA1/2 or only Lynch syndrome occurred in the respective genes (33.1% and 46.2%). In addition, 5.8% of patients with PVs in BRCA1/2 and 26.9% of patients with PVs in Lynch syndrome genes did not meet respective testing criteria.; CONCLUSION: Opportunities to improve upon identification of patients at risk for hereditary cancer predisposition include revising BRCA1/2 and Lynch syndrome testing criteria to include additional clinically actionable genes with overlapping phenotypes and relaxing testing criteria for associated cancers.

AB Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare, highly invasive malignancy, and its incidence is increasing globally. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate a wide array of cellular and biological processes and are dysregulated in various tumors. The functional and biological roles of miRNAs in CCA have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that miR-876 expression levels and copy number are significantly attenuated in the TCGA cohort of CCA tissue samples. TCGA expression data was consistent with the observed substantial decrease in miR-876 expression in patient samples and CCA cell lines. In-silico algorithm databases revealed BCL-XL as a potential target of miR-876. We observed miR-876 expression to be downregulated, whereas, BCL-XL upregulated in CCA cell lines. BCL-XL was identified as a direct functional target of miR-876 in CCA. miR-876-mediated reduction of BCL-XL regulated cell survival, induced apoptosis and caspase 3/7 expression in CCA. BCL-XL overexpression reversed the miR-876 mediated effect on CCA cell growth and apoptosis. Stable overexpression of miR-876 produced potent tumor suppressor activity and in vivo tumor cell growth reduction. Overexpression of miR-876 in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line significantly suppressed BCL-XL expression and spheroid formation with a concomitant induction of caspase 3/7 activity and apoptosis. This study demonstrates a novel tumor suppressor role for miR-876 in CCA, identifies BCL-XL as an actionable target, and suggests a potential therapeutic role for miR-876 in CCA.

AB BACKGROUND: Since the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, organised germline screening, independent of the personal and family cancer history, has been frequently proposed. Since ethnic and geographic populations significantly differ in their mutation spectra and prevalence, one critical prerequisite would be the knowledge of the expected carrier frequencies.; OBJECTIVE: For the first time, in a retrospective non-cancer related cohort from a single Swiss genetic centre, we systematically assessed the prevalence of secondary findings in 19 genes (BRCA1/2 plus 17 non-BRCA genes) previously designated by the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) germline testing.; DESIGN: A total of 400 individuals without a cancer diagnosis undergoing whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) from 2015 to 2017 at IMG Zurich were included after quality assessment. Among these, 180 were unaffected parental couples, 27 unaffected parental singles and 13 NDD index patients (mean age 43 years). The majority of the cohort was of Caucasian ethnicity (n = 336, 84.0%) and of Northwest European ancestry (n = 202, 50.5%), for 70 of whom (42.5%) an autochthonous Swiss descent was assumed. For WES filtering of rare, potentially actionable secondary variants in HBOC genes, an overall minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.65% was used as cut-off. Each rare variant was manually evaluated according to the recommended ACGM-AMP standards, with some adaptations including &ldquo;hypomorphic&rdquo; as an additional distinct pathogenicity class.; RESULTS: Overall, 526 rare secondary variants (339 different variants) were encountered, with the BRCA1/2 genes accounting for 27.2% of the total variant yield. If stratified for variant pathogenicity, for BRCA1/2, three pathogenic variants were found in three females of Italian ancestry (carrier frequency of 0.8%). In the non-BRCA genes, five carriers of (likely) pathogenic variants (1.3%) were identified, with two Swiss individuals harbouring the same CHEK2 Arg160Gly variant known to be recurrent among Caucasians. Hence, the overall carrier rate added up to 2.0%. Additionally, seven various hypomorphic HBOC predisposing alleles were detected in 22 individuals (5.5%).; CONCLUSION: We provide the first evidence of a high prevalence of HBOC-related cancer susceptibility in the heterogeneous Swiss general population and relevant subpopulations, particularly in individuals of Italian descent. These pioneering data may substantiate population-based HBOC screening in Switzerland.

AB BACKGROUND: Management guidelines have identified unmet educational needs in gout patients. Our objective was to develop and pilot test MyGoutCare (MGC©)-a web-based, interactive educational resource for gout patients, tailored to improve knowledge.; METHODS: The website was developed with input from patients and experts. A health informatics expert tailored content areas so the patient could walk through a journey to learn various aspects of gout. During the pilot study, patients completed baseline demographics and a 10-item validated gout knowledge questionnaire. After reviewing the website, patients completed a post-survey within 2 weeks of their physician visit. Data was analyzed using paired t-tests and effect size (ES) was calculated for the changed scores.; RESULTS: Gout patients and experts agreed on these content areas-triggers of flares, comorbidities, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment, healthy gout diet, and lifestyle choices. In the pilot study, 50 patients (mean age of 54 years, mean disease duration of 9.5 years, and mean 3-5 flares/year) were recruited. Their post-survey scores (0-10) on knowledge questions improved significantly when compared to pre-survey scores with mean (SD) of 1.95 (1.76) p < 0.0001, ES = 0.95. Patients identified actionable changes moving forward after reviewing the website-decision to continue lifelong urate-lowering therapy, complying with periodic monitoring of serum urate, and making dietary changes.; CONCLUSIONS: Web-based platforms that offer patient-focused materials can serve as a practical tool to address ongoing educational needs of gout patients. Additional studies are needed to evaluate if the website can improve patient-physician communication and lead to better long-term outcomes.

AB PURPOSE: Practice transformation in primary care is a movement toward data-driven redesign of care, patient-centered care delivery, and practitioner activation. A critical requirement for achieving practice transformation is availability of tools to engage practices.; METHODS: A total of 48 practices with 109 practice sites participate in the Garden Practice Transformation Network in Maryland (GPTN-Maryland) to work together toward practice transformation and readiness for the Quality Payment Program implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Practice-specific data are collected in GPTN-Maryland by practices themselves and by practice transformation coaches, and are provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. These data are overwhelming to practices when presented piecemeal or together, a barrier to practices taking action to ensure progress on the transformation spectrum. The GPTN-Maryland team therefore created a practice transformation analytics dashboard as a tool to present data that are actionable in care redesign.; RESULTS: When practices reviewed their data provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services using the dashboard, they were often seeing, for the first time, cost data on their patients, trends in their key performance indicator data, and their practice transformation phase. Overall, 72% of practices found the dashboard engaging, and 48% found the data as presented to be actionable.; CONCLUSIONS: The practice transformation analytics dashboard encourages practices to advance in practice transformation and improvement of patient care delivery. This tool engaged practices in discussions about data, care redesign, and costs of care, and about how to develop sustainable change within their practices. Research is needed to study the impact of the dashboard on costs and quality of care delivery. © 2019 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

AB Our aim was to investigate sebaceous differentiation in thymus tumours and to identify new actionable genomic alterations. To this end we screened 35 normal and 23 hyperplastic thymuses, 127 thymomas and 41 thymic carcinomas for the presence of sebaceous differentiation as defined by morphology and expression of adipophilin and androgen receptor (AR). One primary thymic carcinoma showed morphology of sebaceous carcinomas (keratinizing and foam cells, calcifications, giant cells), a strong expression of adipophilin and AR together with squamous markers. NGS revealed high-level amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). In thymuses and thymomas, no cells with sebaceous morphology were present. Occasionally, macrophages or epithelial cells showed adipophilin-positivity, however, without co-expression of AR. Thymic sebaceous carcinoma should be considered if a thymic carcinoma shows clear or foamy features. Testing for FGFR2 amplification might be warranted when searching for actionable genomic alterations in sebaceous carcinomas in the mediastinum and in other locations.

AB The emergence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) is the main cause of chemotherapy failure in gastric cancer. In this study, to generate MDR gastric cancer cell lines, we exposed MKN45 and AGS gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, fluorouracil, and adriamycin. Through transcriptome sequencing, we found that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was expressed at significantly lower levels in the MDR cell lines than in the parental cell lines. We then established stable clones of MKN45 and SGC7901 cells with a doxycycline-inducible IRF-1 expression system and confirmed that IRF-1 overexpression efficiently reversed the MDR. Further analyses indicated that IRF-1 suppresses P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in vitro and in vivo, leading to an increase in chemotherapy drug retention. The results showed that IRF-1 bound to the promoter regions of P-gp gene and inhibited P-gp transcription. IFN-gamma induced IRF-1-mediated downregulation of P-gp in gastric cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the clinical correlation between IRF-1 and P-gp expression and that IRF-1 serves as an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. We conclude that IRF-1 reverses the MDR trait of gastric cancer by downregulating P-gp, and this mechanism has potential treatment implications and is clinically actionable.

AB Non-small-cell lung cancer, histologically classified into adenocarcinoma (AD) and squamous cell carcinoma, is one of the most deadly malignancies worldwide. Lung AD (LUAD) could benefit of a plethora of target therapies and, in the last few years, also of immunotherapies. Here we focused on a real-life cohort of LUAD and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset aiming to gain insights into the immune contexture of such a malignancy. We explored the mutational status of 41 genes and the expression of 94 genes, related to immune-checkpoint, inflammation, and stromal microenvironment. Surprisingly, we found that our cohort has a very low mutational burden if we consider our panel as its surrogate. Regarding gene expression data, we identified 31 genes significantly deregulated in tumor tissues compared with a pool of normal samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the deregulated genes is able to identify two clusters of tumor samples, differently enriched in alterations in actionable genes. In particular, we identified a cluster enriched in patients carrying KRAS alterations. In silico deconvolution, that is the inferring of tumor microenvironment composition by gene expression data, through TIMER algorithm has been performed to explore immune microenvironment. Estimation performed on our gene expression matrix showed that B cell infiltration is lower in the KRAS-mutated enriched cluster, as in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. Such a finding has been validated in situ through immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort. Moreover, cases in LUAD-TCGA with low B cell infiltration have a significantly worse overall survival than those with higher levels. In the real-life cohort we observed that cases belonging to cluster enriched in KRAS-mutated patients have a poor outcome. LUAD driven by KRAS mutation represents an unmet clinical need, being refractory to pharmacological inhibition. Our results link KRAS mutations to B cell infiltration. Thus, the present findings could be helpful in a better definition of immunotherapeutic approaches for KRAS mutated patients.

AB Accurate prognostic prediction using molecular information is a challenging area of research, which is essential to develop precision medicine. In this paper, we develop translational models to identify major actionable proteins that are associated with clinical outcomes, like the survival time of patients. There are considerable statistical and computational challenges due to the large dimension of the problems. Furthermore, data are available for different tumor types; hence data integration for various tumors is desirable. Having censored survival outcomes escalates one more level of complexity in the inferential procedure. We develop Bayesian hierarchical survival models, which accommodate all the challenges mentioned here. We use the hierarchical Bayesian accelerated failure time model for survival regression. Furthermore, we assume sparse horseshoe prior distribution for the regression coefficients to identify the major proteomic drivers. We borrow strength across tumor groups by introducing a correlation structure among the prior distributions. The proposed methods have been used to analyze data from the recently curated "The Cancer Proteome Atlas" (TCPA), which contains reverse-phase protein arrays-based high-quality protein expression data as well as detailed clinical annotation, including survival times. Our simulation and the TCPA data analysis illustrate the efficacy of the proposed integrative model, which links different tumors with the correlated prior structures. © 2019 The International Biometric Society.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is extremely prevalent and is the most common noncutaneous malignancy and second-most common cause of cancer death in men. In the last decade, there has been dramatic growth in the use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for diagnosis and characterization of PCa. With the recent and marked surge in popularity in prostate imaging and, specifically, mpMRI, there has been an increased focus on structured reporting as a means by which to provide more actionable information to the referring clinician as well as to improve diagnostic performance with this technique. This work focuses on the evolution of the major structured reporting system in prostate mpMRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS), from its initial proposal and establishment in 2012 as PI-RADS v. 1 to its most current iteration, PI-RADS v. 2.1. This will highlight the key elements that have changed between the versions as well as provide context and rationale for these changes. In addition, this work explores what future iterations of PI-RADS could look like based on current limitations of the system as well as explore areas for future growth of prostate mpMRI, including use of the system in active surveillance populations and in the posttreatment setting.

AB OBJECTIVE: Quality indicators (QIs) can be used to assess and improve the quality of care in health care institutions. Although QIs about nutrition care in hospitals and nursing homes have been used in studies, no systematic catalogue exists to date. This systematic literature review identifies nutrition care QIs in hospitals and nursing homes and maps them according to QI type, stakeholder level and nutrition care theme. We also assess the level of consensus between studies and critically appraise the QIs presented therein based on two conceptual frameworks.; METHODS: Ovid, Scopus and grey literature were searched from 1995 to 2016 including studies in English and German. Papers were considered if they presented, developed, assessed, rated or applied nutrition care QIs in hospitals or nursing homes. We used Donabedian's framework to define structure, process and outcome indicators, the WHO (World Health Organization) definition to describe stakeholder levels, and a structured table to map indicators within themes. Further, we used the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) frameworks' key dimensions to measure the conceptual quality of the QIs. Results are summarised and presented tabulated and narratively.; RESULTS: From 536 identified studies, 46 were included. Eight hundred and twenty-two QIs were extracted and mapped into 19 themes and 151 sub-themes. Half were process indicators (49%) and about a quarter were outcome (28%) and structure (23%) indicators, respectively. The vast majority (71%) targeted micro level, while 28% meso level and only 1% macro level information. The nutrition themes meals/mealtimes (12%), treatment (adherence) (12%), nutrition screening (7%), assessment (7%) and monitoring (7%) were most frequently covered. 69% of indicators were cited by more than one study. Most frequent framework dimensions were patient-centeredness (33%), timeliness (30%), validity (30%) and actionability/feasibility (30%).; CONCLUSION: The large number of nutrition care QIs in hospitals and nursing homes indicates the high interest in and importance of better nutrition care provision in institutions. However, the great variability indicates little consensus of the nutrition community on how to best assess and measure the quality of nutrition care. The limited methodological and conceptual validity of presented QIs and the low representation of QIs at macro and meso levels make international consensus finding complicated. Increased efforts including all stakeholder levels and using conceptual frameworks to define a limited number of key QIs with high methodological validity, actionability and stakeholder relevance are needed.

AB Current models of quality improvement and patient safety (QIPS) education are not fully integrated with clinical care delivery, representing a major impediment toward achieving widespread QIPS competency among health professions learners and practitioners. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada organized a 2-day consensus conference in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, called Building the Bridge to Quality, in September 2016. Its goal was to convene an international group of educational and health system leaders, educators, front-line clinicians, learners, and patients to engage in a consensus-building process and generate a list of actionable strategies that individuals and organizations can use to better integrate QIPS education with clinical care.Four strategic directions emerged: Prioritize the integration of QIPS education and clinical care; build structures and implement processes to integrate QIPS education and clinical care; build capacity for QIPS education at multiple levels; and align educational and patient outcomes to improve quality and patient safety. Individuals and organizations can refer to the specific tactics associated with the 4 strategic directions to create a roadmap of targeted actions most relevant to their organizational starting point.To achieve widespread change, collaborative efforts and alignment of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators are needed on an international scale to shift the culture of educational and clinical environments and build bridges that connect training programs and clinical environments, align educational and health system priorities, and improve both learning and care, with the ultimate goal of achieving improved outcomes and experiences for patients, their families, and communities.

AB BACKGROUND: Transthoracic echocardiography is routinely performed in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) to help plan secondary stroke management, but recent data evaluating its usefulness in this context are lacking. We sought to evaluate the value of echocardiography for identifying clinically actionable findings for secondary stroke prevention.; METHODS: We conducted a multicentre cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with stroke or TIA between 2010 and 2015 at 2 academic hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Clinically actionable echocardiographic findings for secondary stroke prevention included cardiac thrombus, patent foramen ovale, atrial myxoma or valvular vegetation. We identified patient characteristics associated with clinically actionable findings using logistic regression.; RESULTS: Of the 1862 patients with stroke or TIA we identified, 1272 (68%) had at least 1 echocardiogram. Nearly all echocardiograms were transthoracic; 1097 (86%) were normal, 1 (0.08%) had an atrial myxoma, 2 (0.2%) had a valvular vegetation, 11 (0.9%) had a cardiac thrombus and 66 (5.2%) had a PFO. Patent foramen ovale was less likely among patients older than 60 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.57), with prior stroke or TIA (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09-0.76) or with dyslipidemia (adjusted OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15-0.84). Among the 130 patients with cryptogenic stroke who had an echocardiogram (n = 110), a PFO was detected in 19 (17%) on transthoracic echocardiogram.; INTERPRETATION: Most patients with stroke or TIA had a normal echocardiogram, with few having clinically actionable findings for secondary stroke prevention. Clinically actionable findings, specifically PFO, were more common in patients with cryptogenic stroke. © 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors.

AB Targeted cancer therapies are drugs and biologics designed to affect cancer cell growth by blocking or interfering with specific molecular pathways in the cancer cell. Use of targeted agents usually requires verification through molecular testing that the patient's tumor harbors the molecular biomarker that is the target of the drug or is predictive of treatment benefit. Genomic mutations may be clinically actionable if they are associated with response or resistance to a potential therapy. If a genomic test reveals an actionable alteration, there are several options for accessing the targeted therapy. This article is intended to help clinicians determine if a tumor mutation is potentially treatable with a marketed or investigational drug or biologic product and to offer guidance on how to access the product of interest.

AB Background: Within India's military medical framework, alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) is deemed a treatable medical illness incompatible with military service, and complete abstinence is the only acceptable successful treatment outcome. Objective: This study was designed to identify factors which were able to differentiate treatment outcomes of abstinence and relapse among ADS patients in a military framework. Method: Recognizing personal incentives to misrepresent alcohol consumption, abstinence, and relapse outcomes were established using official reports from a patient's parent unit, in combination with biochemical parameters and clinical examination. Patients serially admitted for ADS treatment or follow-up review were surveyed, and their socio-demographic and alcohol consumption profiles, coping styles, life events and specific relapse precipitants were recorded and compared as contributory variables in a cognitive-behavioral model of ADS. From this survey of 140 patients, membership to abstainer or relapser groups was then predicted using a discriminant analysis. Results: 34% of patients achieved early absolute abstinence. No baseline socio-demographic or drinking profile distinctions existed between abstainers and relapsers. Differences were forthcoming on coping styles, life-event, and relapse-precipitant exposure measures. Stepwise discriminant analysis produced a final equation comprising 10 independent variables (including two positive life event measures), which predicted an abstinence/relapse outcome with an 86% and 79% hit-rate (original and cross-validated). Conclusion: Using prevailing cognitive-behavioral constructs, early absolute abstinence emerged as an actionable objective and an achievable goal without any contributory socio-demographic predilections. This preliminary evaluation suggests it is a tenable and realistic target of current ADS treatment programs.

AB The results of many large-scale federal or multi-site evaluations are typically compiled into long reports which end up sitting on policymaker's shelves. Moreover, the information policymakers need from these reports is often buried in the report, may not be remembered, understood, or readily accessible to the policymaker when it is needed. This is not a new challenge for evaluators, and advances in statistical methodology, while they have created greater opportunities for insight, may compound the challenge by creating multiple lenses through which evidence can be viewed. The descriptive evidence from traditional frequentist models, while familiar, are frequently misunderstood, while newer Bayesian methods provide evidence which is intuitive, but less familiar. These methods are complementary but presenting both increases the amount of evidence stakeholders and policymakers may find useful. In response to these challenges, we developed an interactive dashboard that synthesizes quantitative and qualitative data and allows users to access the evidence they want, when they want it, allowing each user a customized, and customizable view into the data collected for one large-scale federal evaluation. This offers the opportunity for policymakers to select the specifics that are most relevant to them at any moment, and also apply their own risk tolerance to the probabilities of various outcomes.

AB Head and neck cancer (HNC) continues to carry a significant burden of disease both for patients and health services. Facilitating biomarker-led treatment decisions is critical to improve outcomes in this group and deliver therapy tailored to the individual tumour biological profile. One solution to develop such biomarkers is a liquid biopsy analysing circulating tumour cells (CTCs)-providing a non-invasive and dynamic assessment of tumour specific alterations in 'real-time'. A major obstacle to implementing such a test is the standardisation of CTC isolation methods and subsequent down-stream analysis. Several options are available, with a recent shift in vogue from positive-selection marker-dependent isolation systems to marker-independent negative-selection techniques. HNC single-CTC characterisation, including single-cell sequencing, to identify actionable mutations and gene-expression signatures has the potential to both guide the understanding of patient tumour heterogeneity and support the adoption of personalised medicine strategies. Microfluidic approaches for isolating CTCs and cell clusters are emerging as novel technologies which can be incorporated with computational platforms to complement current diagnostic and prognostic strategies. We review the current literature to assess progress regarding CTC biomarkers in HNC and potential avenues for future translational research and clinical implementation.

AB BACKGROUND: A common challenge with existing psycho-social prevention interventions for children is the lack of effective, engaging, and scalable delivery mechanisms, especially beyond in-person therapeutic or school-based contexts. Although digital technology has the potential to address these issues, existing research on technology-enabled interventions for families remains limited. This paper focuses on emotion regulation (ER) as an example of a core protective factor that is commonly targeted by prevention interventions.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to provide an initial validation of the logic model and feasibility of in situ deployment for a new technology-enabled intervention, designed to support children's in-the-moment ER efforts. The novelty of the proposed approach relies on delivering the intervention through an interactive object (a smart toy) sent home with the child, without any prior training necessary for either the child or their carer. This study examined (1) engagement and acceptability of the toy in the homes during 1-week deployments, and (2) qualitative indicators of ER effects, as reported by parents and children. In total, 10 families (altogether 11 children aged 6-10 years) were recruited from 3 predominantly underprivileged communities in the United Kingdom, as low SES populations have been shown to be particularly at risk for less developed ER competencies. Children were given the prototype, a discovery book, and a simple digital camera to keep at home for 7 to 8 days. Data were gathered through a number of channels: (1) semistructured interviews with parents and children prior to and right after the deployment, (2) photos children took during the deployment, and (3) touch interactions automatically logged by the prototype throughout the deployment.; RESULTS: Across all families, parents and children reported that the smart toy was incorporated into the children's ER practices and engaged with naturally in moments the children wanted to relax or calm down. Data suggested that the children interacted with the toy throughout the deployment, found the experience enjoyable, and all requested to keep the toy longer. Children's emotional connection to the toy appears to have driven this strong engagement. Parents reported satisfaction with and acceptability of the toy.; CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study on the use of technology-enabled intervention delivery to support ER in situ. The strong engagement, incorporation into children's ER practices, and qualitative indications of effects are promising. Further efficacy research is needed to extend these indicative data by examining the psychological efficacy of the proposed intervention. More broadly, our findings argue for the potential of a technology-enabled shift in how future prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through child-led, situated interventions, where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent skills application. ©Nikki Theofanopoulou, Katherine Isbister, Julian Edbrooke-Childs, Petr Slovak.

AB BACKGROUND: Strategies to improve the effectiveness and quality of health and care have predominantly emphasised the implementation of new research and evidence into service organisation and delivery. A parallel, but less understood issue is how clinicians and service leaders stop existing practices and interventions that are no longer evidence based, where new evidence supersedes old evidence, or interventions are replaced with those that are more cost effective. The aim of this evidence synthesis is to produce meaningful programme theory and practical guidance for policy makers, managers and clinicians to understand how and why de-implementation processes and procedures can work.; METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The synthesis will examine the attributes or characteristics that constitute the concept of de-implementation. The research team will then draw on the principles of realist inquiry to provide an explanatory account of how, in what context and for whom to explain the successful processes and impacts of de-implementation. The review will be conducted in four phases over 18months. Phase 1: develop a framework to map the preliminary programme theories through an initial scoping of the literature and consultation with key stakeholders. Phase 2: systematic searches of the evidence to develop the theories identified in phase 1. Phase 3: validation and refinement of programme theories through stakeholder interviews. Phase 4: formulating actionable recommendations for managers, commissioners and service leaders about what works through different approaches to de-implementation.; DISCUSSION: This evidence synthesis will address gaps in knowledge about de-implementation across health and care services and ensure that guidance about strategies and approaches accounts for contextual factors, which may be operating at different organisational and decision-making levels. Through the development of the programme theory, which explains what works, how and under which circumstances, findings from the evidence synthesis will support managers and service leaders to make measured decisions about de-implementation.; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017081030.

AB BACKGROUND: Adherence to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection remains a challenge for many patients. Routine screening for barriers to ART adherence could help make HIV care more patient-centered and prevent virologic rebound or failure. Our team is currently developing a new HIV-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of these barriers for use in Canada and France along with a digital app for its electronic administration. In our previous work, we developed the PROM's multidimensional conceptual framework and generated 100 English items, which have been translated to French.; OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a Web-based Delphi to help validate and select the content of this new HIV-specific PROM, based on the perspective of anglophone and francophone patients and providers in Canada and France. Here, we present the proposal for this Delphi.; METHODS: This modified Delphi will involve a diverse panel of patients (n=32) and providers (n=52) recruited especially from the 9 sites of the PROM development study (site locations in Canada: Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver; in France: Paris, Nantes, Clermont-Ferrand, Saint-Martin, Cayenne). Overall, 2 rounds of Web-based questionnaires will be conducted. The threshold for consensus is set at 60% and will determine which items are carried forward to the second round. Per item, 3 aspects will be rated: importance as a barrier to ART adherence, relevance for HIV care, and clarity. In both rounds, space will be available for free text comments. Overall comprehensiveness will be assessed in the second round.; RESULTS: This study has undergone a methodological review by experts in patient-oriented research. It has received approval from a research ethics board of the McGill University Health Centre. It is financially supported, in part, by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research-Quebec Support Unit (M006). As of May 21, 2019, 15 people living with HIV and 25 providers completed the first round of the Delphi (24 from Canada and 16 from France).; CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first Delphi to seek consensus on the most relevant and clinically actionable barriers to ART adherence, collecting opinions on an extensive list of barriers. Drawing on a relatively large and diverse panel of HIV patients and providers, it essentially engages key stakeholders in decision making about the PROM's final content, helping to ensure its utility and adoption.; INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/12836. ©Kim Engler, Sara Ahmed, David Lessard, Serge Vicente, Bertrand Lebouche.

AB PURPOSE: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly used to identify actionable mutations for oncology treatment. We examined the results and use of NGS assays at our institution.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 305 consecutive patients who had NGS testing of tumor samples from March 2014 to April 2017. NGS was performed by FoundationOne.; RESULTS: Of the 305 tissue samples sent to FoundationOne, 189 reports were potentially usable. Of these reports, 76 (40.21%) demonstrated an aberration targetable by on-label therapies and 126 (66.67%) by off-label therapies, and 170 (89.94%) revealed actionable aberrations via all potential avenues, including clinical trials; 21 of these 189 potentially usable reports (11.1%) yielded a change in management, including use of on-label therapies (n = 7), use of off-label therapies (n = 6), enrollment in a clinical trial (n = 6), and discontinuation of a medication with a predicted poor response (n = 3; one report was used twice). For the six patients with off-label use, median duration of treatment was 46 days and discontinued after death (n = 3) or progression (n = 3).; CONCLUSION: Only a minority of NGS assay results (6.9% percent of all tests ordered and 11.1% of useable tests) resulted in a management change. A small minority of patients started off-label therapy on the basis of NSG assay results and overall had poor responses to off-label treatment. Although in theory NGS assays may improve oncologic outcomes, the results of our initial 305 patients showed low clinical utility.

AB OBJECTIVES: As personal health data are being returned to patients with increasing frequency and volume, visualizations are garnering excitement for their potential to facilitate patient interpretation. Evaluating these visualizations is important to ensure that patients are able to understand and, when appropriate, act upon health data in a safe and effective manner. The objective of this systematic review was to review and evaluate the state of the science of patient-facing visualizations of personal health data.; METHODS: We searched five scholarly databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ACM Digital Library [Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library], and IEEE Computational Index [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computational Index]) through December 1, 2018 for relevant articles. We included English-language articles that developed or tested one or more patient-facing visualizations for personal health data. Three reviewers independently assessed quality of included articles using the Mixed methods Appraisal Tool. Characteristics of included articles and visualizations were extracted and synthesized.; RESULTS: In 39 articles included in the review, there was heterogeneity in the sample sizes and methods for evaluation but not sample demographics. Few articles measured health literacy, numeracy, or graph literacy. Line graphs were the most common visualization, especially for longitudinal data, but number lines were used more frequently in included articles over past 5 years. Article findings suggested more patients understand the number lines and bar graphs compared with line graphs, and that color is effective at communicating risk, improving comprehension, and increasing confidence in interpretation.; CONCLUSION: In this review, we summarize types and components of patient-facing visualizations and methodologies for development and evaluation in the reviewed articles. We also identify recommendations for future work relating to collecting and reporting data, examining clinically actionable boundaries for diverse data types, and leveraging data science. This work will be critically important as patient access of their personal health data through portals and mobile devices continues to rise. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, and the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education frame patient safety from the perspective of medication management, which is also the current focus of pharmacy education and training. With the growing appreciation that diagnostic errors represent an urgent and actionable patient safety concern, the National Academy of Medicine has recommended diagnostic safety training for all health care professions. The Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine has worked with an interprofessional consensus group to identify a set of 12 key competencies necessary to achieve diagnostic quality and safety that focuses on individual, team-based, and system-related competencies. Much of this already exists in pharmacy education, but pharmacy training programs need to give graduates more guidance on how they contribute to the diagnostic process and the prevention and detection of diagnostic errors. We describe the current state of progress in this regard, and what steps are needed by training programs to provide content and assessment so that graduates achieve the requisite competencies. Governing and advisory bodies need to expand the expectations around patient safety to include diagnostic safety.

Despite this evidence, many obstacles still need to be overcome for the effective clinical implementation of PGx. To translate the pharmacogenetic testing into actionable clinical decisions, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has been developing guidelines for several drug-gene pairs. This review will show the applicability of PGx in chronic pain from disease to treatment; report the drug-gene pairs with strongest evidences in the clinic; and the challenges for the clinical implementation of PGx.

AB Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is comprised of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHC) and gallbladder cancer (GBC). These tumors arise in the biliary epithelium, share histological characteristics and are associated with grim prognosis even when diagnosed at early stages. Moreover, its relatively low incidence in developed countries has precluded the development of clinical trials addressing specific differences among BTC subgroups in terms of their biology, treatment response and clinical outcomes. In this scenario, the development of effective treatment strategies for patients has been rather modest. To date, the combination of cisplatin plus gemcitabine remains as the standard first line therapy in advanced disease and after progression to this regimen there are limited treatment options. Next generation sequencing (NGS) studies have assessed the distribution of driver genes and potentially actionable genomic alterations among ICC, EHC and GBC. Here, we outline genomic differences among these subsets and describe key milestones in order to develop novel targeted drugs against BTCs. Although the early results of several studies are promising, international collaboration is critical to conduct adequately-powered trials, enrolling patients from high-incidence countries.

AB Background: Formative feedback from residents is essential to improve residency programs, and focus groups may provide rich information. However, residents may withhold information due to fear of retaliation or speak less candidly to please focus group moderators.; Objective: We assessed participant perceptions and utility of feedback obtained from a confidential focus group exchange between 2 residency programs.; Methods: Anesthesiology and pediatric programs at the same institution participated in 2017. Residents voluntarily provided program feedback during 1 of 2 confidential focus groups for each program. Each focus group was moderated by the program director (PD) of the other specialty. The PDs used thematic analysis to identify themes for use by the respective programs in improvement efforts. An anonymous survey was distributed after the focus groups to collect participant perceptions (quantitative and narrative) on this approach.; Results: Thirteen residents of 140 (9.3%) participated (7 anesthesiology, 6 pediatrics). Thematic feedback from focus groups was largely consistent with known issues, although novel information was also obtained (eg, pediatric interns wanted earlier one-on-one meetings with their PD). Survey data suggest that residents were able to share more meaningful feedback than they would otherwise, and they did not feel that having an external moderator (a PD who may have been unfamiliar with the specialty) was a barrier to discussion. The approach required 6 hours of time for each PD and approximately $200 for dinners.; Conclusions: The focus group exchange required modest resources, was perceived as safe by residents, and generated robust, actionable feedback for the programs.

AB OBJECTIVES: To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2018.; METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting of the editorial team was organized to conclude on the selection of best papers.; RESULTS: Among the 1,469 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper describes a simple algorithm detecting co-morbidities in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) using a clinical data warehouse and a knowledge base. The authors of the second best paper present a federated algorithm for predicting heart failure hospital admissions based on patients' medical history described in their distributed EHRs. The third best paper reports the evaluation of an open source, interoperable, and scalable data quality assessment tool measuring completeness of data items, which can be run on different architectures (EHRs and Clinical Data Warehouses (CDWs) based on PCORnet or OMOP data models). The fourth best paper reports a data quality program conducted across 37 hospitals addressing data quality Issues through the whole data life cycle from patient to researcher.; CONCLUSIONS: Research efforts in the CRI field currently focus on consolidating promises of early Distributed Research Networks aimed at maximizing the potential of large-scale, harmonized data from diverse, quickly developing digital sources. Data quality assessment methods and tools as well as privacy-enhancing techniques are major concerns. It is also notable that, following examples in the US and Asia, ambitious regional or national plans in Europe are launched that aim at developing big data and new artificial intelligence technologies to contribute to the understanding of health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems, and returning actionable feedback loops to improve existing models of research and care. The use of "real-world" data is continuously increasing but the ultimate role of this data in clinical research remains to be determined. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB PURPOSE: Gene fusions involving neuregulin 1 (NRG1) have been noted in multiple cancer types and have potential therapeutic implications. Although varying results have been reported in other cancer types, the efficacy of the HER-family kinase inhibitor afatinib in the treatment of NRG1 fusion-positive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is not fully understood.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-seven patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma received comprehensive whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and analysis. Two patients with gene fusions involving NRG1 received afatinib treatment, with response measured by pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT imaging.; RESULTS: Three of 47 (6%) patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were identified as KRAS wild type by whole-genome sequencing. All KRAS wild-type tumors were positive for gene fusions involving the ERBB3 ligand NRG1. Two of 3 patients with NRG1 fusion-positive tumors were treated with afatinib and demonstrated a significant and rapid response while on therapy.; CONCLUSIONS: This work adds to a growing body of evidence that NRG1 gene fusions are recurrent, therapeutically actionable genomic events in pancreatic cancers. Based on the clinical outcomes described here, patients with KRAS wild-type tumors harboring NRG1 gene fusions may benefit from treatment with afatinib.See related commentary by Aguirre, p. 4589. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Multiple national organizations recommend screening and counseling adults for unhealthy alcohol use.; METHODS: An evidence-based approach to screening and counseling using Epic electronic health record (EHR) tools was implemented in a general medicine clinic. A dissemination package with actionable steps for clinics and systems wishing to implement similar processes was then produced. To evaluate the initial implementation and quality improvement project, run charts were created to track patients screened, patients counseled, and fidelity to protocols, and members of the original project team were interviewed to assess facilitators and barriers. The draft dissemination package was revised after feedback from health system representatives (key informants).; RESULTS: More than 9,000 patients (73.9% of those eligible) were screened in 20 months. Sixty-four percent of patients with positive initial screens had documented screening-related assessment; 39.7% (141/355) were offered counseling when indicated. Initial project team members identified EHR tools, clinic leadership, quality improvement culture, a multidisciplinary team, and training for providers and nurses as facilitators; and competing demands, patient population size, and nursing staff/resident turnover as barriers. Six key informants evaluated the dissemination package. Most rated 10 of the 12 sections as very useful; all rated components specific to implementing alcohol screening and counseling as very useful. Ratings for general guidance on implementing evidence-based services in primary care were more mixed.; CONCLUSION: Evidence-based screening and counseling for unhealthy alcohol use can be implemented with EHR tools. A dissemination guide was viewed favorably by key informants and can serve as a guide for other clinics and systems. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Signal transduction cascades drive cellular proliferation, apoptosis, immune, and survival pathways. Proteins have emerged as actionable drug targets because they are often dysregulated in cancer, due to underlying genetic mutations, or dysregulated signaling pathways. Cancer drug development relies on proteomic technologies to identify potential biomarkers, mechanisms-of-action, and to identify protein binding hot spots. Areas covered: Brief summaries of proteomic technologies for drug discovery include mass spectrometry, reverse phase protein arrays, chemoproteomics, and fragment based screening. Protein-protein interface mapping is presented as a promising method for peptide therapeutic development. The topic of biosimilar therapeutics is presented as an opportunity to apply proteomic technologies to this new class of cancer drug. Expert opinion: Proteomic technologies are indispensable for drug discovery. A suite of technologies including mass spectrometry, reverse phase protein arrays, and protein-protein interaction mapping provide complimentary information for drug development. These assays have matured into well controlled, robust technologies. Recent regulatory approval of biosimilar therapeutics provides another opportunity to decipher the molecular nuances of their unique mechanisms of action. The ability to identify previously hidden protein hot spots is expanding the gamut of potential drug targets. Proteomic profiling permits lead compound evaluation beyond the one drug, one target paradigm.

AB Background: The design of meaningful and enjoyable Exergames for fitness training in older adults possesses critical challenges in matching user's needs and motivators with game elements. These challenges are often due to the lack of knowledge of seniors' game preferences and technology literacy as well as a poor involvement of the target population in the design process. Objective: This research aims at describing a detailed and scrutinized use case of applying human-centered design methodologies in the gamification of fitness training routines and illustrates how to incorporate seniors' feedback in the game design pipeline. Materials and Methods: We focus on how to use the insights from human-centered inquiries to improve in-game elements, such as mechanics or esthetics, and how to iterate the game design process based on playtesting sessions in the field. Results: We present a set of four Exergames created to train the critical functional fitness areas of older adults. We show how through rapid prototyping methods and multidisciplinary research, Exergames can be rigorously designed and developed to match individual physical capabilities. Moreover, we propose a set of guidelines for the design of context-aware Exergames based on the lessons learned. Conclusion: We highlight the process followed; it depicts 19 weeks of various activities delivering particular and actionable items that can be used as a checklist for future games for health design projects.

AB OBJECTIVES: Quantifying tumor DNA in tissue and circulating in blood permits high-quality molecular monitoring to detect and track cancer progression. Evaluating tumor DNA in both blood and saliva in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) could provide a non-invasive and clinically actionable method for real-time disease detection.; METHODS: We previously validated an ultrasensitive droplet-digital (dd)PCR assay targeting the dominant high-risk HPV subtypes causally linked to OPC. Here we enrolled an observational cohort to evaluate the predictive and prognostic potential of paired plasma-salivary tumor DNA among 21 patients with advanced HPV+OPC.; RESULTS: In patients with recurrent, persistent locoregional (LR) disease, median baseline normalized salivary HPV DNA was 10.9 copies/ng total DNA, nearly 20x higher compared with those with distant disease only (p = 0.01). A cutoff of 5 copies/ng yielded 87% sensitivity and 67% specificity for accurately predicting LR disease. Total tumor burden among those with LR disease strongly correlated with salivary HPV DNA levels (R = 0.83, p = 0.02). The rise and fall of salivary HPV DNA predicted treatment failure and response, respectively, in all patients with LR disease, and predated imaging findings. Among paired salivary-plasma (cell-free) cfDNA samples, only higher plasma HPV cfDNA levels were associated with poor outcomes (p < 0.01), suggesting that each bodily fluid provides unique information about HPV disease status.; CONCLUSIONS: Salivary HPV DNA provides valuable information about tumor burden and predicts treatment response in advanced HPV+OPC. Paired blood-saliva samples could be used to monitor HPV DNA with broad applications to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and surveillance in HPV-associated diseases. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many academic institutions strive to promote more diverse and inclusive campuses for faculty, staff, and students. As part of this effort, these institutions seek to include individuals from historically underrepresented groups (URGs)-such as women, people from racial/ethnic minority populations, persons with disabilities-on committees and in other service activities. However, given the low number of faculty members from URGs at many institutions, these faculty members tend to receive more requests to provide service to the institution or department (e.g., serving on committees, mentoring) than their counterparts from majority groups. Faculty members from URGs, especially early-career faculty, thus risk becoming overburdened with providing service at the expense of working on other scholarly activities required for promotion and tenure (i.e., conducting research, publishing). Although many scholars and others have written about this "minority tax" and its implications for early-career faculty from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups, fewer have published about how this tax extends beyond racial/ethnic minorities to women and persons with disabilities. Further, the literature provides scant practical advice on how to avoid overburdening early-career faculty from URGs. Here, a group of multidisciplinary early- and mid-career faculty members from URGs seek to provide their peers from URGs with practical strategies for both evaluating the appropriateness of service requests and declining those that are not a good fit. The authors also provide institutional leaders with actionable recommendations to prevent early-career faculty from URGs from becoming overburdened with service.

AB PURPOSE: Although EGFR activation is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM), anti-EGFR therapy has so far not yielded the desired effects. Targeting PI3K/Akt has been proposed as a strategy to increase the cellular sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Here we evaluated the contribution of FOXO3a, a key Akt target, in the response of GBM cells to EGFR inhibition.; METHODS: FOXO3a activation was assessed by immunofluorescence and gene reporter assays, and by evaluating target gene expression using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Cellular effects were evaluated using cell viability and apoptosis assays, i.e., Annexin V/PI staining and caspase 3/7 activity measurements. Drug synergism was evaluated by performing isobolographic analyses. Gene silencing experiments were performed using stable shRNA transfections.; RESULTS: We found that EGFR inhibition in GBM cells led to FOXO3a activation and to transcriptional modulation of its key targets, including repression of the oncogene FOXM1. In addition, we found that specific FOXO3a activation recapitulated the molecular effects of EGFR inhibition, and that the FOXO3a activator trifluoperazine, a FDA-approved antipsychotic agent, reduced GBM cell growth. Subsequent isobolographic analyses of combination experiments indicated that trifluoperazine and erlotinib cooperated synergistically and that their concomitant treatment induced a robust activation of FOXO3a, leading to apoptosis in GBM cells. Using gene silencing, we found that FOXO3a is essential for the response of GBM cells to EGFR inhibition.; CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that FOXO3a activation is a crucial event in the response of GBM cells to EGFR inhibition, suggesting that FOXO3a may serve as an actionable therapeutic target that can be modulated using FDA-approved drugs.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review offers an operational definition of systems engineering (SE) as applied to public health, reviews applications of SE in the field of HIV, and identifies opportunities and challenges of broader application of SE in global health.; RECENT FINDINGS: SE involves the deliberate sequencing of three steps: diagnosing a problem, evaluating options using modeling or optimization, and providing actionable recommendations. SE includes diverse tools (from process improvement to mathematical modeling) applied to decisions at various levels (from local staffing decisions to planning national-level roll-out of new interventions). Contextual factors are crucial to effective decision-making, but there are gaps in understanding global decision-making processes. Integrating SE into pre-service training and translating SE tools to be more accessible could increase utilization of SE approaches in global health. SE is a promising, but under-recognized approach to improve public health response to HIV globally.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between care fragmentation and patient ratings of care quality and identify potentially actionable mediators.; DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: 2015 telephone survey of 1395 women Veterans with three or more visits in primary care and/or women's health care in the prior year at 12 Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.; STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis.; DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We operationalized lower care fragmentation as receiving VA-only care versus dual use of VA/non-VA care. Participants rated VA care quality (overall care, women's health care (WH), and primary care (PC)) and three aspects of their patient experience (ease of access to services, provider communication, and gender sensitivity of VA environments). We examined associations between care fragmentation and care ratings and applied the Karlson-Holm-Breen decomposition method to test for mediation by aspects of patients' experience.; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Lower care fragmentation was associated with higher ratings of care quality (odds ratios [95% CI] for overall care: 1.57 [1.14;2.17]; WH: 1.65 [1.20;2.27]; PC: 1.41 [1.10;1.82]). Relationships were mediated by patient-rated provider communication and gender sensitivity (26-54 percent and 14-15 percent of total effects, respectively). Ease of access was associated with higher care ratings (odds ratios [95% CI] for overall care: 2.93 [2.25;3.81]; WH: 2.81 [2.15;3.68]; PC: 2.33 [1.63;3.33], in models with the three types of patient care experiences included), but did not mediate the association of care fragmentation and care ratings.; CONCLUSIONS: Potential negative effects of care fragmentation on care quality ratings could be mitigated by attention to quality of patient-provider communication and gender sensitivity of VA environments. © Health Research and Educational Trust.

AB Current advances in assisted reproductive technologies aim to promote the health and well-being of future children. They offer the possibility to select embryos with the greatest potential of being born healthy (eg, preimplantation genetic testing) and may someday correct faulty genes responsible for heritable diseases in the embryo (eg, human germline genome modification (HGGM)). Most laws and policy statements surrounding HGGM refer to the notion of 'serious' as a core criterion in determining what genetic diseases should be targeted by these technologies. Yet, this notion remains vague and poorly defined, rendering its application challenging and decision making subjective and arbitrary. By way of background, we begin by briefly presenting two conceptual approaches to 'health' and 'disease': objectivism (ie, based on biological facts) and constructivism (ie, based on human values). The basic challenge under both is sorting out whether and to what extent social and environmental factors have a role in helping to define what qualifies as a 'serious' disease beyond the medical criteria. We then focus on how a human rights framework (eg, right to science and right to the highest attainable health) could integrate the concepts of objectivism and constructivism so as to provide guidance for a more actionable consideration of 'serious'. Ultimately, it could be argued that a human rights framework, by way of its legally binding nature and its globally accepted norms and values, provides a more universal foundation for discussions of the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging or disruptive technologies. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB OBJECTIVES: Resistance to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a clinical challenge in patients with oncogene-driven non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We have analyzed the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to impact the clinical care of patients with TKI resistance.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional prospective study including consecutive EGFR, ALK, or ROS1-altered NSCLC patients with TKI resistance from 12 Spanish institutions. Post-progression ctDNA NGS was performed by Guardant Health (Guardant360 assay).; RESULTS: We included 53 patients separated in 3 cohorts: 31 EGFR-mutant NSCLCs with first/second-generation TKI resistance (cohort 1), 15 EGFR T790M + NSCLCs with osimertinib resistance (cohort 2), and 7 ALK/ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs with crizotinib and/or next-generation TKI resistance (cohort 3). Besides Guardant360, 22 patients from cohort 1 (71%) underwent post-progression tumor biopsies and/or alternative plasma-based genotyping. In the entire study population, 34 patients (64%) had reliable evidence of tumor-DNA shed for resistance assessment, and 24 patients (45%) had actionable alterations. Target-independent pathogenic alterations were frequently detected, particularly at osimertinib resistance. Eleven patients (20%) received subsequent molecular-guided therapies indicated by plasma NGS alone (n = 9, 17%), or plasma NGS and tissue sequencing (n = 2, 4%), deriving the expected clinical benefit. Of these, 9 had EGFR T790 M mutation and received osimertinib, 1 had ALK G1202R mutation and received lorlatinib, and 1 had ROS1 G2032R mutation and received cabozantinib. Two additional cases from cohort 1 (6%) had undetectable EGFR T790 M by Guardant360 but were T790M + by tissue and BEAMing digital PCR respectively, and also received osimertinib.; CONCLUSION: NGS of ctDNA detects actionable alterations in a large proportion of oncogene-driven NSCLC patients with TKI resistance, and can be used to guide subsequent treatments as a complement or alternative to tissue or PCR-based plasma genotyping in the real-world clinical setting.

AB OBJECTIVES: Plasma genotyping represents an opportunity for convenient detection of clinically actionable mutations in advanced cancer patients, such has been well-documented in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Oncogenic gene fusions are complex variants that may be more challenging to detect by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Rigorous evaluation of plasma NGS assays in the detection of fusions is needed to maximize clinical utility.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Additional plasma was collected from patients with advanced NSCLC and ALK, ROS1, or RET gene fusions in tissue who had undergone clinical plasma NGS using Guardant360(G360, Guardant Health). We then sequenced extracted cfDNA with a plasma NGS kit focused on known driver mutations in NSCLC (ctDx-Lung, Resolution Bioscience) with cloud-based bioinformatic analysis and blinded variant calling.; RESULTS: Of 16 patients assayed known to harbor anALK, ROS1, or RET in tumor, G360 detected fusions in 7 cases, ctDx-Lung detected fusions in 13 cases, and 3 cases were detected by neither. Of the 7 fusions detected by both assays, G360 reported lower mutant allelic fractions (AF). In cases missed by G360, tumor derived TP53 mutations were often detected confirming presence of tumor DNA. Raw sequencing data showed that inverted or out-of-frame variants were overrepresented in cases detected using ctDx-Lung but not by G360.; CONCLUSION: Focusing on complex, clinically actionable mutations using tumor as a reference standard allows for evaluation of technical differences in plasma NGS assays that may impact clinical performance. Noting the heterogeneity of fusion sequences observed in NSCLC, we hypothesize that differences in hybrid capture techniques and bioinformatic calling may be sources of variations in sensitivity among these assays.

AB CONTEXT: Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with no approved systemic therapies for unresectable locally invasive or distant metastatic disease. Understanding the molecular changes in advanced PC can provide better understanding of this disease and potentially help directing targeted therapy.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate tumor-specific genetic changes using next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels.; DESIGN: All patients with advanced PC were tested for hot-spot panels using NGS panels including a 50-gene panel, a 409-gene panel if the standard 50-gene panel (Ion Torrent, Life Technology) was negative or a FoundationOne panel.; SETTING: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.; PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 11 patients with advanced PC were selected to undergo molecular testing.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Genetic profiles of advanced PC.; RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, 4 patients had the 50-gene panel only, 6 had 409-gene panel after a negative 50-gene panel and 1 had FoundationOne. One patient who had 50-gene panel only also had his metastatic site (esophagus) of his tumor tested with FoundationOne. The most common mutations identified were in the PI3K (PIK3CA, TSC1 and ATM) (4/11 patients) and TP53 (3/11) pathways. Genes not previously reported to be mutated in PC included: SDHA, TERT promoter and DICER1. Actionable mutations were found in 54% (6/11) of the patients.; CONCLUSIONS: Mutational profiling using NGS panels in advanced PC has yielded important potentially targetable genetic alterations. Larger studies are needed to identify commonly mutated genes in advanced PC patients. Development of novel therapies targeting these cellular pathways should be considered.

AB With exome/genome sequencing (ES/GS) integrated into the practice of medicine, there is some potential for reporting incidental/secondary findings (IFs/SFs). The issue of IFs/SFs has been studied extensively over the last 4 years. In order to evaluate their implications in care organisation, we retrospectively evaluated, in a cohort of 700 consecutive probands, the frequency and burden of introducing the search for variants in a maximum list of 244 medically actionable genes (genes that predispose carriers to a preventable or treatable disease in childhood/adulthood and genes for genetic counselling issues). We also focused on the 59 PharmGKB class IA/IB pharmacogenetic variants. We also compared the results in different gene lists. We identified variants (likely) affecting protein function in genes for care in 26 cases (3.7%) and heterozygous variants in genes for genetic counselling in 29 cases (3.8%). Mean time for the 700 patients was about 6.3min/patient for medically actionable genes and 1.3min/patient for genes for genetic counselling, and a mean time of 37min/patients for the reinterpreted variants. These results would lead to all 700 pre-test counselling sessions being longer, to 55 post-test genetic consultations and to 27 secondary specialised medical evaluations. ES also detected 42/59 pharmacogenetic variants or combinations of variants in the majority of cases. An extremely low metabolizer status in genes relevant for neurodevelopmental disorders (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) was found in 57/700 cases. This study provides information regarding the need to anticipate the implementation of genomic medicine, notably the work overload at various steps of the process.

AB A significant threat to the recent, wide deployment of machine learning-based systems, including deep neural networks (DNNs), is adversarial learning attacks. The main focus here is on evasion attacks against DNN-based classifiers at test time. While much work has focused on devising attacks that make small perturbations to a test pattern (e.g., an image) that induce a change in the classifier's decision, until recently there has been a relative paucity of work defending against such attacks. Some works robustify the classifier to make correct decisions on perturbed patterns. This is an important objective for some applications and for natural adversary scenarios. However, we analyze the possible digital evasion attack mechanisms and show that in some important cases, when the pattern (image) has been attacked, correctly classifying it has no utility---when the image to be attacked is (even arbitrarily) selected from the attacker's cache and when the sole recipient of the classifier's decision is the attacker. Moreover, in some application domains and scenarios, it is highly actionable to detect the attack irrespective of correctly classifying in the face of it (with classification still performed if no attack is detected). We hypothesize that adversarial perturbations are machine detectable even if they are small. We propose a purely unsupervised anomaly detector (AD) that, unlike previous works, (1) models the joint density of a deep layer using highly suitable null hypothesis density models (matched in particular to the nonnegative support for rectified linear unit (ReLU) layers); (2) exploits multiple DNN layers; and (3) leverages a source and destination class concept, source class uncertainty, the class confusion matrix, and DNN weight information in constructing a novel decision statistic grounded in the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Tested on MNIST and CIFAR image databases under three prominent attack strategies, our approach outperforms previous detection methods, achieving strong receiver operating characteristic area under the curve detection accuracy on two attacks and better accuracy than recently reported for a variety of methods on the strongest (CW) attack. We also evaluate a fully white box attack on our system and demonstrate that our method can be leveraged to strong effect in detecting reverse engineering attacks. Finally, we evaluate other important performance measures such as classification accuracy versus true detection rate and multiple measures versus attack strength.

AB BACKGROUND: Diagnostic timeliness in cancer patients is important for clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction but, to-date, continuous monitoring of diagnostic intervals in nationwide incident cohorts has been impossible in England.; METHODS: We developed a new methodology for measuring the secondary care diagnostic interval (SCDI - first relevant secondary care contact to diagnosis) using linked cancer registration and healthcare utilisation data. Using this method, we subsequently examined diagnostic timeliness in colorectal and lung cancer patients (2014-15) by socio-demographic characteristics, diagnostic route and stage at diagnosis.; RESULTS: The approach assigned SCDIs to 94.4% of all incident colorectal cancer cases [median length (90th centile) of 25 (104) days] and 95.3% of lung cancer cases [36 (144) days]. Advanced stage patients had shorter intervals (median, colorectal: stage 1 vs 4 - 34 vs 19 days; lung stage 1&2 vs 3B&4 - 70 vs 27 days). Routinely referred patients had the longest (colorectal: 61, lung: 69 days) and emergency presenters the shortest intervals (colorectal: 3, lung: 14 days). Comorbidities and additional diagnostic tests were also associated with longer intervals.; CONCLUSION: This new method can enable repeatable nationwide measurement of cancer diagnostic timeliness in England and identifies actionable variation to inform early diagnosis interventions and target future research.

AB OBJECTIVE: Safety assessment is crucial for the development of continuous improvement strategies. However, most studies assess construction safety with cross-sectional information and thus management tends to be passive. This study proposes an evidence-based methodology incorporating hazard rectification efficiency for project safety assessment.; METHOD: First, we theoretically introduced hazard rectification efficiency as a proxy for hazard exposure. Later, based on set-pair analysis, we proposed a safety assessment model that incorporates hazard occurrence and rectification efficiency. Subsequently, we collected site investigation records from seven building projects in Qingdao, Shandong. The data were used to develop a safety performance index (SPI) with the proposed model and a default model. The results were compared and discussed according to industrial practices for validation purposes.; RESULTS: The proposed model provides conservative indications of project safety performance; more importantly, the index calculated with the model provides advance warning when necessary. In the proposed method, in terms of the SPI, hazard and rectification indicators provide actionable information to address failures and improve safety conditions.; IMPLICATIONS: This research describes a new perspective (rectification efficiency) for safety assessment, which supplements the current body of knowledge on safety assessment. The proposed index, SPI, promotes the adoption of proactive hazard identification, monitoring, and control in construction. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tissue sampling of biliary tract carcinomas (BTCs) for molecular characterization is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of identifying individual actionable mutations derived from bile cell‑free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted deep sequencing. Ten BTC patients, four with gallbladder carcinomas and six with cholangiocarcinomas, were enrolled in the present study. Using targeted deep sequencing with a panel of 150 tumor‑related genes, paired bile cfDNA and tumor DNA were analyzed for mutational variants individually and then compared. The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to reveal that bile cfDNA is predominantly comprised of long DNA fragments, which is not the case for plasma cfDNA. Herein, paired bile cfDNA and tumors from ten BTC patients were examined using targeted deep sequencing. When comparing bile cfDNA and tumor DNA for single nucleotide variation(SNV)/insertion and deletion (Indel), the results using targeted deep sequencing revealed high sensitivity (94.7%) and specificity(99.9%). Additionally, the sensitivity of detecting a copy number variation (CNV) was 75.0%, with a specificity of 98.9%. When comparing two bile extraction methods, including percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage and operation, no significant difference in SNV/Indel or CNV detection sensitivity was noted. Moreover, when examining the tumor stage and incidence site, AJCC stageII and the distal bile duct both had significantly decreased CNV detection sensitivities. The present study revealed that targeted deep sequencing can reliably detect mutational variants within bile cfDNA obtained from BTC patients. These preliminary results may shed light on bile cfDNA as a promising liquid biopsy for BTC patients.

AB Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospitalization and viruses are important causal pathogens, especially in the elderly, immunocompromised patients and those with respiratory or cardiovascular comorbidities. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as comprising a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality in older and at-risk adults, and the emergence of rapid point-of-care molecular testing has made it possible to confirm an RSV diagnosis accurately, in a clinically actionable timeframe. RSV patients have significantly higher healthcare resource use (including hospital stays and emergency room/urgent care visits) than non-RSV matched controls, especially if aged ≥65years, a longer length of hospitalization than those with influenza, and associated costs nearly three times higher. We found no direct clinical outcome data specific to rapid molecular testing for RSV in adults and very little in children. There is very limited evidence that prompt diagnosis may reduce hospital length of stay but this and other outcome parameters need confirmation in larger, prospective clinical trials. Regarding reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, the picture is mixed and testing alone is unlikely to change entrenched habits. There is little incentive for clinicians to order routine RSV tests in adults given the absence of a specific antiviral therapy. However, with numerous vaccine and antiviral candidates in clinical development, we believe it is good practice to plan and start establishing standardized testing protocols - perhaps as part of outcome studies. For especially vulnerable patients, e.g., immunocompromised and transplant patients, prompt accurate RSV diagnosis may prevent disease spread and save lives. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUND: Mucinous tubular and spindle-cell carcinoma (MTSCC) is a rare kidney cancer subtype with limited cases reported in the literature. We report on outcomes of 25 patients with this variant who were managed at our institution.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institution database was queried, and clinical data extracted for patients with MTSCC. Molecular features examined included next-generation sequencing with Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets and allele-specific copy number analysis using the Fraction and Allele-Specific Copy Number Estimates from Tumor Sequencing (FACETS) algorithm in a subset of patients.; RESULTS: All patients underwent primary tumor-directed therapy (nephrectomy= 23, cryoablation= 2). Metastases were diagnosed in 6 patients (24%), 3 (12%) of whom had de novo metastatic disease. Five of 6 patients with metastatic disease had high-grade histological features compared with 0 of 19 nonmetastatic patients (83% vs. 0%; P< .001, Fisher exact test). Three-year overall survival from diagnosis was 84.8% (95% confidence interval, 59.6-94.9) with a median follow-up time of 3.9 years (range, 1 month to 10.3 years). Three deaths occurred, all from metastatic disease. Four patients received systemic therapy with time to treatment failure≤6 months across different agents with the exception of 1 patient with prolonged response with sunitinib treatment (30.6 months). The most frequent molecular alterations were neurofibromin 2 mutations (n= 2; 40%), germline alterations (n= 2; 40%) including checkpoint kinase 2 and BRCA2 DNA repair associated mutations, multiple chromosomal copy number losses, and mismatch repair deficiency in 1 patient.; CONCLUSION: MTSCC is characterized by localized tumors treated successfully with primary tumor-directed therapy. However, patients with high-grade histological features were more likely to develop metastatic disease with limited responses to standard therapies. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The development of allogeneic hematopoietic-stem-cell transplantation has improved the prognosis of younger acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, the outcome of older AML patients remains poor. The majority of AML patients are elderly. For elderly AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy, less toxic single agent that targets a specific gene mutation or combination therapy with a single agent is needed. The role of chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations in leukemia has become more apparent, and detailed prognostic stratification based on the type of genetic mutation has been established. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used for gene analysis of AML. In the future, the evaluation of biologically homogeneous population on the basis of chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations will lead to a paradigm shift that will help in the development of optimized therapy. As rapid diagnosis of gene mutations is required by the clinical physicians to decide on induction therapy, it is important to have a swift turnaround time for comprehensive DNA sequencing to provide actionable data to clinical physicians. It is required to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the turnaround time from sending the specimens to receiving the results while maintaining the quality of the specimens contributing to gene analysis. To detect infrequent gene mutations, investigators need to perform multicenter studies and/or cooperative-group trials with a certain sample size to examine the frequency of the gene mutations in elderly AML patients, enabling sufficient statistical power for meaningful comparisons.

AB A major challenge in medical genetics is to characterize variants of unknown significance (VUS). Doing so would help delineate underlying causes of disease and the design of customized treatments. Infertility has presented an especially difficult challenge with respect to not only determining if a given patient has a genetic basis, but also to identify the causative genetic factor(s). Though genome sequencing can identify candidate variants, in silico predictions of causation are not always sufficiently reliable so as to be actionable. Thus, experimental validation is crucial. Here, we describe the phenotype of mice containing a non-synonymous (proline-to-threonine at position 306) change in Spo11, corresponding to human SNP rs185545661. SPO11 is a topoisomerase-like protein that is essential for meiosis because it induces DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) that stimulate pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes. Although both male and female Spo11P306T/P306T mice were fertile, they had reduced sperm and oocytes, respectively. Spermatocyte chromosomes exhibited synapsis defects (especially between the X and Y chromosomes), elevated apoptotic cells, persistent markers of DSBs, and most importantly, fewer Type 1 crossovers that causes some chromosomes to have none. Spo11P306T/- mice were sterile and made fewer meiotic DSBs than Spo11+/- animals, suggesting that the Spo11P306T allele is a hypomorph and likely is delayed in making sufficient DSBs in a timely fashion. If the consequences are recapitulated in humans, it would predict phenotypes of premature ovarian failure, reduced sperm counts, and possible increased number of aneuploid gametes. These results emphasize the importance of deep phenotyping in order to accurately assess the impact of VUSs in reproduction genes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB PURPOSE: Alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes produce therapeutic biomarkers. However, the characteristics and significance of DDR alterations remain undefined in primary liver cancer (PLC).; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with PLC were enrolled in the trial (PTHBC, NCT02715089). Tumors and matched blood samples from participants were collected for a targeted next-generation sequencing assay containing exons of 450 cancer-related genes, including 31 DDR genes. The OncoKB knowledge database was used to identify and classify actionable alterations, and therapeutic regimens were determined after discussion by a multidisciplinary tumor board.; RESULTS: A total of 357 patients with PLC were enrolled, including 214 with hepatocellular carcinoma, 122 with ICC, and 21 with mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 92 (25.8%) patients had at least one DDR gene mutation, 15 of whom carried germline mutations. The most commonly altered DDR genes were ATM (5%) and BRCA1/2 (4.8%). The occurrence of DDR mutations was significantly correlated with a higher tumor mutation burden regardless of the PLC pathologic subtype. For DDR-mutated PLC, 26.1% (24/92) of patients possessed at least one actionable alteration, and the actionable frequency in DDR wild-type PLC was 18.9% (50/265). Eight patients with the BRCA mutation were treated by olaparib, and patients with BRCA2 germline truncation mutations showed an objective response.; CONCLUSIONS: The landscape of DDR mutations and their association with genetic and clinicopathologic features demonstrated that patients with PLC with altered DDR genes may be rational candidates for precision oncology treatment. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in technology and research are rapidly changing the diagnostic approach to hereditary gastrointestinal cancer (HGIC) syndromes. Although the practice of clinical genetics is currently transitioning from targeted criteria-based testing to multigene panels, important challenges remain to be addressed. The aim of this study was to develop and technically validate the performance of a multigene panel for HGIC.; METHODS: CGT-colon-G14 is an amplicon-based panel designed to detect single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions in 14 well-established or presumed high-penetrance genes involved in HGIC. The assay parameters tested were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and inter-run and intra-run reproducibility. Performance and clinical impact were determined using 48 samples of patients with suspected HGIC/polyposis previously tested with the targeted approach.; RESULTS: The CGT-colon-G14 panel showed 99.99% accuracy and 100% inter- and intra-run reproducibility. Moreover, panel testing detected 1 actionable pathogenic variant and 16 variants with uncertain clinical impact that were missed by the conventional approach because they were located in genes not previously analyzed.; CONCLUSION: Introduction of the CGT-colon-G14 panel into the clinic could provide a higher diagnostic yield than a step-wise approach; however, results may not always be straightforward without the implementation of new genetic counseling models.

AB Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) are often disclosed to patients despite ambiguous association with disease risk and lack of clinical actionability. It is important to understand how patients understand a VUS result, but few studies have assessed this. Our qualitative study explored patient recall, reaction to, and interpretation of a VUS in the context of multigene panels. We conducted 11 semi-structured phone interviews with adults who had a VUS identified on multigene panel testing in a hereditary oncology clinic, with questions focusing on the VUS result, personal and family history, and motivations for and expectations of genetic testing. Transcripts were coded iteratively, using both deductive and inductive codes. Overall, participants usually recalled that they had a VUS, despite variation in the vocabulary used. Participants responded both emotionally and intellectually to receiving information about having a VUS, which was often a result of their expectations and motivations prior to testing. Overall, participants understood the lack of clinical significance of a VUS, yet often interpreted the etiologic significance of a VUS within the context of the personal and family history. Our study provides insight into a process by which patients translate uncertain genetic testing results into a construct that fits within their current belief framework and which may be facilitated by a genetic counselor. © 2019 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB PURPOSE: Targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA has become more widely used in the management of patients with lung adenocarcinoma; however, no clear mitogenic driver alteration is found in some cases. We evaluated the incremental benefit of targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in the identification of gene fusions and MET exon 14 (METex14) alterations in DNA sequencing (DNAseq) driver-negative lung cancers.; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lung cancers driver negative by MSK-IMPACT underwent further analysis using a custom RNAseq panel (MSK-Fusion). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was assessed as a potential prioritization criterion for targeted RNAseq.; RESULTS: As part of prospective clinical genomic testing, we profiled 2,522 lung adenocarcinomas using MSK-IMPACT, which identified 195 (7.7%) fusions and 119 (4.7%) METex14 alterations. Among 275 driver-negative cases with available tissue, 254 (92%) had sufficient material for RNAseq. A previously undetected alteration was identified in 14% (36/254) of cases, 33 of which were actionable (27 in-frame fusions, 6 METex14). Of these 33 patients, 10 then received matched targeted therapy, which achieved clinical benefit in 8 (80%). In the 32% (81/254) of DNAseq driver-negative cases with low TMB [0-5 mutations/Megabase (mut/Mb)], 25 (31%) were positive for previously undetected gene fusions on RNAseq, whereas, in 151 cases with TMB >5 mut/Mb, only 7% were positive for fusions (P < 0.0001).; CONCLUSIONS: Targeted RNAseq assays should be used in all cases that appear driver negative by DNAseq assays to ensure comprehensive detection of actionable gene rearrangements. Furthermore, we observed a significant enrichment for fusions in DNAseq driver-negative samples with low TMB, supporting the prioritization of such cases for additional RNAseq.See related commentary by Davies and Aisner, p. 4586. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB BACKGROUND: Dietary behavior change interventions for the self-management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have the potential to slow disease progression and reduce metabolic complications. Telehealth-delivered dietary interventions may assist in the self-management of CKD, although their acceptability by patients is unknown.; OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the acceptability and experiences of a telehealth coaching intervention that utilized telephone calls and tailored text messages to improve diet quality in patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD.; DESIGN: Semistructured interview study of adults with CKD.; PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Adults with stage 3 to 4 CKD (n=21) aged 28 to 78 (mean 62) years, who completed a 12-week telehealth-delivered dietary intervention in Queensland, Australia, were interviewed from March to July2017.; DATA ANALYSIS: Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically.; RESULTS: Five themes were identified: valuing relationships (receiving tangible and perceptible support, building trust and rapport remotely, motivated by accountability, readily responding to a personalized approach, reassured by health professional expertise); appreciating convenience (integrating easily into lifestyle, talking comfortably in a familiar environment, minimizing travel and wait time burden); empowered with actionable knowledge (comprehending diet-disease mechanisms, practical problem solving for sustainable dietary behavior); increasing diet consciousness (learning from recurrent feedback, prompted by reiteration of messages); making sense of complexity (contextualizing and prioritizing comorbidities, gaining confidence to make dietary decisions, setting and achieving realistic goals).; CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with stage 3 to 4 CKD, individualized telehealth coaching for improving diet quality was convenient for patients, and they felt supported and empowered to navigate recommendations and prioritize dietary behavior changes. Telehealth-delivered dietary interventions appear to be well accepted by patients as a way of providing regular, tailored contact with a health professional to support dietary management in CKD.

AB The practice of recontacting patients to provide new health information is becoming increasingly common in clinical genetics, despite the limited research to evidence the patient experience. We explored how men with Lynch Syndrome (LS) understand and experience being recontacted about a potential increased risk of prostate cancer. Sixteen men with LS (Meanage 51years) were recruited from an Australian screening study to undergo a semi-structured interview. A modified grounded theory approach was used to guide data collection and thematic analysis. Qualitative coding was shared by the research team to triangulate analysis. The practice of recontact was viewed by participants as acceptable and was associated with minimal emotional distress. The majority of men understood that they may be above population risk of prostate cancer, although evidence was still emerging. Men reported high engagement with personal and familial health, including regular screening practices and familial risk communication. Findings suggest that men's carrier status and beliefs about the actionability of the new cancer risk information influence their response to recontact. Recontact practices that include the offer of risk management strategies may lead to improved patient outcomes (e.g., reduced cancer worry and increased health engagement), if perceived as valuable by recipients. © 2019 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare and relatively indolent tumors of the pancreas. While primary SPNs can be surgically resected, there are currently no therapies available for patients with advanced stage disease. Given that these tumors frequently carry CTNNB1 hotspot (recurrently mutated loci in a gene) mutations resulting in beta-catenin nuclear accumulation, it has been speculated that the Wnt pathway may be a driver in this disease. Here, we present a comprehensive "multi-omics" study where the genome, transcriptome, and methylome of SPNs were analyzed. We found that SPNs are characterized by a low-complexity genome where somatic mutations in CTNNB1, present in 100% of the cases, are the only actionable genomic lesions. Compared to more common subtypes of pancreatic tumors (adenocarcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), SPNs show high expression levels of genes belonging to the Wnt pathway. Their methylome was consistent with an epithelial cell origin and a general upregulation of Wnt pathway genes. Clinical studies to evaluate the exquisite sensitivity of SPNs to inhibitors of the Wnt pathway are warranted. © 2019 The Authors. Published by FEBS Press and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Over the past decade, failure to rescue-defined as the death of a patient after one or more potentially treatable complications-has received increased attention as a surgical quality indicator. Failure to rescue is an appealing quality target because it implicitly accounts for the fact that postoperative complications may not always be preventable and is based on the premise that prompt recognition and treatment of complications is a critical, actionable point during a patient's postoperative course. Although numerous patient and macrosystem factors have been associated with failure to rescue, there is an increasing appreciation of the key role of microsystem factors. Although failure to rescue is believed to contribute to observed hospital-level variation in both surgical outcomes and costs, further work is needed to delineate the underlying patient-level and system-level factors preventing the timely identification and treatment of postoperative complications. Therefore, the goals of this narrative review are to provide a conceptual framework for understanding failure to rescue, to discuss various associated patient- and system-level factors, to delineate the reasons it has become recognized as an important quality indicator, and to propose future directions of scientific inquiry for developing effective interventions that can be broadly implemented to improve postoperative outcomes across all hospitals.

AB AIMS: Polymorphous adenocarcinoma (PAC) usually follows an indolent course, but some cases may show recurrences and high-grade features. The genetic events associated with recurrences and high-grade versions are yet to be defined. Our aim was to determine the genetic underpinning of recurrent PACs of the salivary gland and the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations in cases with high-grade histology.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Four PACs from three patients, including one case with matching primary and recurrent tumours, one de-novo high-grade PAC, and a PAC that transformed to a high-grade tumour following multiple recurrences, were subjected to targeted sequencing (Memorial Sloan Kettering Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets assay) or whole-exome sequencing. Both matching primary and recurrent tumours, and the de-novo high-grade PAC, harboured clonal PRKD1 E710D hotspot mutations, whereas the PAC that underwent high-grade transformation upon recurrence, which was wild-type for PRKD1, harboured a PRKD2 rearrangement. The PACs analysed here also harboured mutations targeting cancer genes such as PIK3CA, SETD2, ARID1A, and NOTCH2. A clonal decomposition analysis of the matching primary and recurrent PACs revealed that a minor subclone from the primary tumour became dominant in the recurrent tumour following a clonal selection evolutionary pattern.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that recurrent and high-grade PACs are underpinned by PRKD1 E710D hotspot mutations or PRKD2 rearrangements, and that recurrences of PACs may stem from the selection of pre-existing subclones in the primary tumour. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Background. Highly processed foods are inexpensive and abundant in our food supply, nutritionally poor, and disproportionately marketed to minority youth. This study is part of a curriculum development project to develop, implement, and evaluate the In Defense of Food (IDOF) curriculum designed to increase intake of whole/minimally processed foods and decrease intake of highly processed foods in youth. Aims. This pilot outcome evaluation was undertaken to assess initial effectiveness and to provide an in-depth understanding of changes in behavioral outcomes and psychosocial mediators. Methods. We used an explanatory mixed method approach, including a single-arm pretest-posttest of intervention effect, followed by a food rules assessment and in-depth interviews to describe participant responses to the intervention in more detail. The study was conducted in three afterschool classrooms in urban low-income neighborhoods with 32 multiethnic middle-school youth, receiving 10 weekly 2-hour sessions. Results. Two weeks postintervention, there was a large positive significant increase in whole/minimally processed food intake (p < .01; d = 0.59) and a small decrease in consumption of highly-processed foods (p = ns; d = 0.06), compared with baseline. Significant increases in psychosocial mediators: Self-efficacy and positive outcomes expectations were seen; others were not significant but changed in the desired direction. Qualitative assessments suggest that the intervention promoted skill building, but environmental barriers made these difficult to use. Discussion. The IDOF curriculum may be most effective for promoting consumption of fruits and vegetables, rather than decreasing intake of highly processed foods. In addition, in this young age-group, short actionable food rules may support self-regulation and behavior change. Conclusion. Among adolescent students in low-income urban neighborhoods, the IDOF afterschool curriculum may help promote self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancies and increase fruit and vegetable intake. Focusing on food processing and using "Food Rules" may be promising to elicit behavior change in youth; however, greater supports are needed to overcome social and environmental barriers.

AB Tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently confer the greatest survival gain for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with actionable genetic alterations. Simultaneously, the increasing number of targets and compounds poses the challenge of reliable, broad and timely molecular assays for the identification of patients likely to benefit from novel treatments. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and clinical utility of comprehensive, NGS-based genetic profiling for routine workup of advanced NSCLC based on the first 3,000 patients analyzed in our department. Following automated extraction of DNA and RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, parallel sequencing of DNA and RNA for detection of mutations and gene fusions, respectively, was performed using PCR-based enrichment with an ion semiconductor sequencing platform. Overall, 807 patients (27%) were eligible for currently approved, EGFR-/BRAF-/ALK- and ROS1-directed therapies, while 218 additional cases (7%) with MET, ERBB2 (HER2) and RET alterations could potentially benefit from experimental targeted compounds. In addition, routine capturing of comutations, e.g. TP53 (55%), KEAP1 (11%) and STK11 (11%), as well as the precise typing of fusion partners and involved exons in case of actionable translocations including ALK and ROS1, are prognostic and predictive tools currently gaining importance for further refinement of therapeutic and surveillance strategies. The reliability, low dropout rates (<5%), minimal tissue requirements, fast turnaround times (6 days on average) and lower costs of the diagnostic approach presented here compared to sequential single-gene testing, highlight its practicability in order to support individualized decisions in routine patient care, enrollment in molecularly stratified clinical trials, as well as translational research. © 2019 UICC.

AB PURPOSE: To understand the experiences of adult cancer survivors as they transition from the end of cancer treatment to follow-up care as a basis for developing actionable recommendations to integrate cancer care delivery and survivorship care.; METHODS: A national survey was conducted in collaboration with ten Canadian provinces to identify unmet needs and experiences with follow-up for cancer survivors between 1 and 3years post-treatment. Surveys were available in English and French and completed either on paper or on-line. Samples were drawn from provincial cancer registries and packages distributed by mail.; RESULTS: A total of 40,790 survey packages were mailed out across the ten provinces and 12,929 surveys were completed by adults (age 30+years), and 329 surveys were completed by adolescents and young adults (age 18 to 29years) giving an overall response rate of 33.3%. For the purposes of this publication, the focus will be on the adult sample. In the adult cohort (age 30+years), 51% of the sample were females, 60% were 65years of age or older, and 77% had not experienced metastatic spread. Three-quarters reported their health as good/very good and 82% that their quality of life was good/very good. Overall, 87% experienced at least one physical concern, 78% experienced at least one emotional concern, and 44% experienced at least one practical concern. The average number of concerns reported for each domain ranged from 2.0 to 3.8. For those who sought help, a third experienced difficulty obtaining assistance or did not receive it. The most frequently cited reasons for not seeking help was that someone had told them what they were experiencing was normal.; CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that many adult survivors have concerns about physical, emotional, and practical issues but are not receiving help to reduce their suffering. It is imperative we take action to correct this current reality.

AB QUALITY PROBLEM OR ISSUE: Within healthcare, policy documents are often used to strategically standardize, streamline or change how general health issues are managed for a specific patient group or treatment. Despite significant effort in developing policy and strategic planning documents, these may not have the intended impact and their value has long been questioned by practitioners.; CHOICE OF SOLUTION: To identify barriers and affordances for the implementation and use of a strategic plan for cancer care in the Western Sweden Healthcare Region, we used Concept Mapping; a participatory mixed method approach to inquiry consisting of both qualitative and quantitative tasks intended to elicit and integrate the diverse perspectives of multiple stakeholders.; IMPLEMENTATION: The study was carried out between April and October 2017 and consisted of several sequential data collection steps: idea generation, sorting and rating ideas for importance and feasibility. Stakeholders from different levels and professions in cancercare participated, but the number varied in the separate steps of data collection: idea generation (n = 112), sorting (n = 16) and rating (n = 38).; EVALUATION: A concept map visualized seven areas that stakeholders throughout the cancer-care process considered necessary to address in order to enable the implementation of the plan. Skills provision was considered the most important cluster but also rated as least feasible. A consistent theme emerged that information, or lack thereof, might be a barrier for the plan being put into action to a greater extent in the cancer-care units. Nine actionable ideas rated highly on both importance and feasibility were presented as a go-zone.; LESSONS LEARNED: Our results suggest that efforts might be better spent on ensuring information about and accessibility to strategic documents throughout the organization, rather than frequently updating them or producing new ones. Having sufficient skills provision seems to be the prerequisite for successful implementation. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB The actionable space surrounding the body, referred to as peripersonal space (PPS), has been the subject of significant interest of late within the broader framework of embodied cognition. Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have shown the representation of PPS to be built from visuotactile and audiotactile neurons within a frontoparietal network and whose activity is modulated by the presence of stimuli in proximity to the body. In contrast to single-unit and fMRI studies, an area of inquiry that has received little attention is the EEG characterization associated with PPS processing. Furthermore, although PPS is encoded by multisensory neurons, to date there has been no EEG study systematically examining neural responses to unisensory and multisensory stimuli, as these are presented outside, near, and within the boundary of PPS. Similarly, it remains poorly understood whether multisensory integration is generally more likely at certain spatial locations (e.g., near the body) or whether the cross-modal tactile facilitation that occurs within PPS is simply due to a reduction in the distance between sensory stimuli when close to the body and in line with the spatial principle of multisensory integration. In the current study, to examine the neural dynamics of multisensory processing within and beyond the PPS boundary, we present auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli at various distances relative to participants' reaching limit-an approximation of PPS-while recording continuous high-density EEG. We question whether multisensory (vs. unisensory) processing varies as a function of stimulus-observer distance. Results demonstrate a significant increase of global field power (i.e., overall strength of response across the entire electrode montage) for stimuli presented at the PPS boundary-an increase that is largest under multisensory (i.e., audiovisual) conditions. Source localization of the major contributors to this global field power difference suggests neural generators in the intraparietal sulcus and insular cortex, hubs for visuotactile and audiotactile PPS processing. Furthermore, when neural dynamics are examined in more detail, changes in the reliability of evoked potentials in centroparietal electrodes are predictive on a subject-by-subject basis of the later changes in estimated current strength at the intraparietal sulcus linked to stimulus proximity to the PPS boundary. Together, these results provide a previously unrealized view into the neural dynamics and temporal code associated with the encoding of nontactile multisensory around the PPS boundary.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated microsatellite instability (MSI) status and programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as predictors of prognosis and responsiveness to chemotherapy for stage II/III gastric cancer.; BACKGROUND: The clinical implications of MSI status and PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer have not been well-elucidated.; METHODS: Tumor specimens and clinical information were collected from patients enrolled in the CLASSIC trial-a randomized controlled study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Five quasi-monomorphic mononucleotide markers were used to assess tumor MSI status. PD-L1 expressions of tumor and stromal immune cells were evaluated using immunohistochemistry.; RESULTS: Of 592 patients, 40 (6.8%) had MSI-high (MSI-H) tumors. Among 582 patients available for immunohistochemistry evaluation, PD-L1 was positive in tumor cells (tPD-L1) of 16 patients (2.7%) and stromal immune cells (sPD-L1) of 165 patients (28.4%). Multivariable analysis of disease-free survival (DFS) showed that MSI-H and sPD-L1-positivity were independent prognostic factors [hazard ratio 0.301 (0.123-0.736), 0.714 (0.514-0.991); P = 0.008, 0.044), as were receiving chemotherapy, age, tumor grade, and TNM stage. Although adjuvant chemotherapy improved DFS in the microsatellite-stable (MSS) group (5-year DFS: 66.8% vs 54.1%; P = 0.002); no benefit was observed in the MSI-H group (5-year DFS: 83.9% vs 85.7%; P = 0.931). In the MSS group, sPD-L1-negative patients, but not sPD-L1-positive patients, had significant survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery only (5-year DFS: 66.1% vs 50.7%; P = 0.001).; CONCLUSION: MSI status and PD-L1 expression are clinically actionable biomarkers for stratifying patients and predicting benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after D2 gastrectomy for stage II/III gastric cancer.

AB The Viking Health Study Shetland is a population-based research cohort of 2,122 volunteer participants with ancestry from the Shetland Isles in northern Scotland. The high kinship and detailed phenotype data support a range of approaches for associating rare genetic variants, enriched in this isolate population, with quantitative traits and diseases. As an exemplar, the c.1750G>A; p.Gly584Ser variant within the coding sequence of the KCNH2 gene implicated in Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), which occurred once in 500 whole genome sequences from this population, was investigated. Targeted sequencing of the KCNH2 gene in family members of the initial participant confirmed the presence of the sequence variant and identified two further members of the same family pedigree who shared the variant. Investigation of these three related participants for whom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotypes were available allowed a unique shared haplotype of 1.22Mb to be defined around this locus. Searching across the full cohort for this haplotype uncovered two additional apparently unrelated individuals with no known genealogical connection to the original kindred. All five participants with the defined haplotype were shown to share the rare variant by targeted Sanger sequencing. If this result were verified in a healthcare setting, it would be considered clinically actionable, and has been actioned in relatives ascertained independently through clinical presentation. The General Practitioners of four study participants with the rare variant were alerted to the research findings by letters outlining the phenotype (prolonged electrocardiographic QTc interval). A lack of detectable haplotype sharing between c.1750G>A; p.Gly584Ser chromosomes from previously reported individuals from Finland and those in this study from Shetland suggests that this mutation has arisen more than once in human history. This study showcases the potential value of isolate population-based research resources for genomic medicine. It also illustrates some challenges around communication of actionable findings in research participants in this context.

AB Whole-exome/genome sequencing analyses lead to detect disease-causing variants that are unrelated to the initial clinical question. Irrespective of any actionable gene list, only pathogenic variants should be considered. The pathogenicity of 55 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants of known various impacts was assessed by a group of experts by comparing data from specialized databases CFTR-France and CFTR2 with those of general clinical databases ClinVar and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional and data aggregators VarSome and InterVar. The assessment of cystic fibrosis (CF) variants was correct with ClinVar and HGMD Professional while less reliable with VarSome and InterVar. Conversely, the risk of overclassifying variants as CF-causing was up to 82% with HGMD Professional. The concordance between data aggregators was only 50%. The use of general databases and aggregators is thus associated with a substantial risk of misclassifying variants. This evaluation may be extrapolated to other disease conditions and incites to remain cautious in interpreting and disclosing incidental findings. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The expanding use of tumor genome analysis by next generation sequencing to drive target therapies has led to increased germline findings in genes predisposing to hereditary cancer. These putative germline findings obtained from theranostic analyses, such as BRCA1/2 gene testing, large panels, whole-exome, or whole-genome sequencing, need to be managed carefully and in an anticipated way with the patient. Before the genetic analysis of a tumor, specific information should be given to patients, who should be aware that the results may have extra-therapeutic medical issues for themselves and relatives. We previously published a list of 36 actionable genes predisposing to cancer for which informing the patient is recommended prior to pangenomic germline analysis because of available screening or preventive strategies. Here, we report clinical practice considerations and schemes for managing germline findings in tumor analyses, including written informed consent and a multidisciplinary approach involving an oncologist, molecular biologist/pathologist, and geneticist in case of germline findings. A somatic result showing a deleterious mutation in a known predisposing gene in a patient who has consented to this purpose should result in referral to a geneticist who is part of the multidisciplinary team. At any time of the somatic analysis process, the patient may have access to a geneticist consultation if additional information is required. This framework will optimally manage both personalized theranostic issues and specific preventive strategies for individuals and relatives; it will also simplify and accelerate the process of genetic testing.

AB There is limited understanding of how patella realignment or patellectomy to surgically manage patellofemoral pain (PFP) affects knee biomechanics. By analysing marsupials like kangaroos that lack an ossified patella, actionable biomimetic insight for the management of end-stage PFP could be gained. This study aimed to provide the foundation of a multi-stage approach, by establishing a static biomechanical profile of the kangaroo stifle that informs the inputs and factors requiring consideration for future dynamic analyses. Volumetric CT and MRI sequences were obtained for four hindlimbs from two Macropus giganteus specimens, from which three-dimensional models of the stifles were created. Two limbs were dissected to visualise the insertion points, origins and lines of action of the quadriceps muscles and the knee extensor mechanism. Static measurements were obtained from the three-dimensional models to establish the biomechanical profile. The results confirmed structural differences in the kangaroo stifle with lack of an ossified patella, a prominent tuberosity and a shorter femur, which functionally affect the mechanical advantage and the torque-generating capability of the joint. The data reported in this study can be used to inform the inputs and constraints of future comparative analyses from which important lessons can be learned for the human knee.

AB BACKGROUND: Not all the mutations are equally important for the development of metastasis. What about their order? The survival of cancer cells from the primary tumour site to the secondary seeding sites depends on the occurrence of very few driver mutations promoting oncogenic cell behaviours. Usually these driver mutations are among the most effective clinically actionable target markers. The quantitative evaluation of the effects of a mutation across primary and secondary sites is an important challenging problem that can lead to better predictability of cancer progression trajectory.; RESULTS: We introduce a quantitative model in the framework of Cellular Automata to investigate the effects of metabolic mutations and mutation order on cancer stemness and tumour cell migration from breast, blood to bone metastasised sites. Our approach models three types of mutations: driver, the order of which is relevant for the dynamics, metabolic which support cancer growth and are estimated from existing databases, and non-driver mutations. We integrate the model with bioinformatics analysis on a cancer mutation database that shows metabolism-modifying alterations constitute an important class of key cancer mutations.; CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a quantitative basis of how the order of driver mutations and the number of mutations altering metabolic processis matter for different cancer clones through their progression in breast, blood and bone compartments. This work is innovative because of multi compartment analysis and could impact proliferation of therapy-resistant clonal populations and patient survival. Mathematical modelling of the order of mutations is presented in terms of operators in an accessible way to the broad community of researchers in cancer models so to inspire further developments of this useful (and underused in biomedical models) methodology. We believe our results and the theoretical framework could also suggest experiments to measure the overall personalised cancer mutational signature.

AB BACKGROUND: Astroblastoma (ABM) is a rare glial brain tumor. Recurrent meningioma 1 (MN1) alterations have been recently identified in most pediatric cases. Adolescent and adult cases, however, remain molecularly poorly defined.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed clinical and molecular characterization of a retrospective cohort of 14 adult and 1 adolescent ABM.; RESULTS: Strikingly, we found that MN1 fusions are a rare event in this age group (1/15). Using methylation profiling and targeted sequencing, most cases were reclassified as either pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA)-like or high-grade glioma (HGG)-like. PXA-like ABM show BRAF mutation (6/7 with V600E mutation and 1/7 with G466E mutation) and CD34 expression. Conversely, HGG-like ABM harbored specific alterations of diffuse midline glioma (2/5) or glioblastoma (GBM; 3/5). These latter patients showed an unfavorable clinical course with significantly shorter overall survival (p = .021). Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (including FGFR fusion, BRAF and NF1 mutations) were present in 10 of 15 patients and overrepresented in the HGG-like group (3/5) compared with previously reported prevalence of these alterations in GBM and diffuse midline glioma.; CONCLUSION: We suggest that gliomas with astroblastic features include a variety of molecularly sharply defined entities. Adult ABM harboring molecular features of PXA and HGG should be reclassified. Central nervous system high-grade neuroepithelial tumors with MN1 alterations and histology of ABM appear to be uncommon in adults. Astroblastic morphology in adults should thus prompt thorough molecular investigation aiming at a clear histomolecular diagnosis and identifying actionable drug targets, especially in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Astroblastoma (ABM) remains a poorly defined and controversial entity. Although meningioma 1 alterations seem to define a large subset of pediatric cases, adult cases remain molecularly poorly defined. This comprehensive molecular characterization of 1 adolescent and 14 adult ABM revealed that adult ABM histology comprises several molecularly defined entities, which explains clinical diversity and identifies actionable targets. Namely, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma-like ABM cases show a favorable prognosis whereas high-grade glioma (glioblastoma and diffuse midline gliome)-like ABM show significantly worse clinical courses. These results call for in-depth molecular analysis of adult gliomas with astroblastic features for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of discordant LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) liver observations on multiphase contrast-enhanced (MCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with cirrhosis.; METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 93 cirrhosis patients who underwent 1.5 or 3 T MCE MRI for evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two abdominal radiologists independently reviewed T1-, T2-, diffusion-weighted unenhanced images as well as MCE T1-weighted fat-suppressed images and reported liver observations using LI-RADS. Concordance were recorded for detection (co-detected by both radiologists or not), size category (<10; 10-19;≥20mm), and LI-RADS category assignment as reportable (LR-3/4/5/M) and actionable (LR-4/5/M). The overall concordance (i.e., concordant in detection, size, and LR-category) was calculated with 95% confidence interval [CI], and separately for detection, size, and LR-category. Clinical significance of discordance was assessed as impact on follow-up imaging, referral for biopsy, liver transplant eligibility, or treatment modality.; RESULTS: Reportable and actionable observations were overall concordant between two radiologists only in 32.3% [24.6, 41.0] and 40.1% [29.5, 51.5] of cases, respectively. Poor overall concordance was related to detection concordance of 52.0% [44.3, 59.5] and 62.5% [52.3, 71.8], as well as LR-category concordance of 73.7% [61.6, 83.1] and 70.9% [57.3, 81.6], for reportable and actionable observations, respectively. Discordant LI-RADS observations would have impacted clinical management in 30 subjects (43.5%), most (66.7%) of whom were due to discordant detection.; CONCLUSION: Discordant MRI LI-RADS observations are common in patients with cirrhosis and may have potential implications for patient management.

AB INTRODUCTION: Renal transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease, but organ demand continues to outstrip supply. The transplantation of kidneys from donors with small renal masses (SRMs) represents a potential avenue to expand the donor pool. We reviewed all published cases of transplants from donors with SRMs and we present followup data, best practices, and outline an actionable series of steps to guide the implementation of such transplants at individual centres.; METHODS: A detailed literature search of the MEDLINE/PubMed and SCOPUS databases was performed. Thirty unique data sets met inclusion criteria and described the transplantation of tumorectomized kidneys; nine data sets described the transplantation of contralateral kidneys from donors with SRMs.; RESULTS: A total of 147 tumorectomized kidneys have been transplanted. Pathology revealed 120 to be renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), of which 116 were stage T1a (0.3-4 cm). The mean followup time was 44.2 months (1-200 months). A single suspected tumor recurrence occurred in one patient nine years post-transplantation and it was managed with active surveillance. Twenty-seven kidneys have been transplanted from deceased donors with contralateral renal masses. Pathology revealed 25 to be RCCs, of which 19 were confirmed to be stage T1 (<7 cm). The mean followup time was 46.7 months (0.5-155 months). One recipient developed an RCC and underwent curative allograft nephrectomy.; CONCLUSIONS: Careful use of kidneys from donors with SRMs is feasible and safe, with an overall recurrence rate of less than 1.5%. The utilization of such kidneys could help alleviate the organ shortage crisis.

AB This study aims to assess the potential clinical application of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS)-based deep sequencing for the detection of clinically relevant mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) obtained from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Targeted deep sequencing was performed to identify High Confidence Somatic Variants (HCSVs) in matched tumor tissue DNA (tDNA) and ctDNA in 50 NSCLC patients. Our results demonstrated that NSCLC patients with Stage IV (61.5%) exhibited a higher concordance rate at the mutation level between plasma ctDNA and tDNA samples than those with Stage I-III (14.5%). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the allele frequency of these detected HCSVs in ctDNA increased with the advance in tumor stage. Besides, using tDNA as a reference, the sensitivity of plasma ctDNA analyzed by deep NGS for actionable EGFR was much higher in patients with Stage IV (66.6%) than those with Stage I-III (7.7%). In conclusion, it appears that ctDNA NGS-based deep sequencing is a feasible approach to identify mutations in patients with Stage IV NSCLC. However, additional methods with higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the successful application of this platform in the earlier stages of NSCLC.

AB PURPOSE: The study was aimed at assessing the suitability of English-language Internet health information related to vocal hygiene, vocal health, and prevention of voice disorders. We also examined the relation between suitability, readability, and quality of Internet health information.; METHOD: Suitability of 77 websites from Dueppen et al9 was assessed using the Suitability Assessment of Materials tool. Information about readability and quality of the websites were extracted from Dueppen et al.9 RESULTS: The overall converted suitability percent score of all 77 websites was 66.4%, which represents "adequate" suitability. Individual websites were rated as superior (ie, 44.2%) adequate (ie, 51.9%), and not suitable (ie, 3.9%). No relation was found between website origin and the suitability ratings. The inter-rater reliability of the Suitability Assessment of Materials ratings for overall scale was found to be good. The suitability of websites had a moderate correlation with readability measures, but no significant correlation was observed between the suitability and quality of websites.; CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that overall suitability of websites on vocal hygiene are adequate. However, many websites may require improvements in some elements (eg, literacy demand, graphics, and learning stimulation). Readability, quality, and suitability are important components in the accessibility of health information for people with different health conditions. Hence, improvements in these elements are expected to improve the understanding and actionability of people with voice issues. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is growing across sub-Saharan Africa and many healthcare systems are ill-equipped for this growing burden. Evidence suggests that healthcare providers may be underdiagnosing and undertreating ACS, leading to poor health outcomes. The goal of this study was to examine provider perspectives on barriers to ACS care in Tanzania in order to identify opportunities for interventions to improve care.; METHODS: Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with physicians and clinical officers from emergency departments and outpatient departments in northern Tanzania. Thematic analysis was conducted using an iterative cycle of coding and consensus building.; RESULTS: The 11 participants included six physicians and five clinical officers from health centers, community hospitals and one referral hospital. Providers identified barriers related to providers, systems and patients. Provider-related barriers included inadequate training regarding ACS and poor application of textbook-based knowledge. System-related barriers included lack of diagnostic equipment, unavailability of treatments, referral system delays, lack of data regarding disease burden, absence of locally relevant guidelines and cost of care. Patient-related barriers included inadequate ACS knowledge, inappropriate healthcare-seeking behavior and non-adherence.; CONCLUSIONS: This study identified actionable barriers to ACS care in northern Tanzania. Multifaceted interventions are urgently needed to improve care. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB BACKGROUND: CDK4/6 inhibitors are a promising treatment strategy in tumor therapy but are hampered by resistance mechanisms. This study was performed to reveal predictive markers, mechanisms of resistance and to develop rational combination therapies for a personalized therapy approach in bladder cancer.; METHODS: A genome-scale CRISPR-dCas9 activation screen for resistance to the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib was performed in the bladder cancer derived cell line T24. sgRNA counts were analyzed using next generation sequencing and MAGeCK-VISPR. Significantly enriched sgRNAs were cloned and validated on a molecular and functional level for mediating resistance to Palbociclib treatment. Analysis was done in vitro and in vivo in the chorioallantois membrane model of the chicken embryo. Comparison of screen hits to signaling pathways and clinically relevant molecular alterations was performed using DAVID, Reactome, DGIdb and cBioPortal.; RESULTS: In the screen, 1024 sgRNAs encoding for 995 genes were significantly enriched indicative of mediators of resistance. 8 random sgRNAs were validated, revealing partial rescue to Palbociclib treatment. Within this gene panel, members of Receptor-Tyrosine Kinases, PI3K-Akt, Ras/MAPK, JAK/STAT or Wnt signaling pathways were identified. Combination of Palbociclib with inhibitors against these signaling pathways revealed beneficial effects in vitro and in in vivo xenografts.; CONCLUSIONS: Identification of potential predictive markers, resistance mechanisms and rational combination therapies could be achieved by applying a CRISPR-dCas9 screening approach in bladder cancer.

AB In this paper, I postulate that the processing of concepts which are deemed controllable is rooted in neurological machinery located in the posterior parietal cortex specialised for the processing of objects which are immediately actionable because they are within reach. This is demonstrated with reference to the near-miss effect in gambling behaviour, where it is argued that the configurative proximity of the near-miss outcome to the win outcome creates the impression that the win outcome is 'almost within reach' or controllable. The perceived realisability of the desired outcome increases subjective reward probability and the associated expected action value, which impacts decision-making and behaviour. When extended to substance addiction, this novel hypothesis adds fresh insight into understanding the motivational effects associated with cue exposure and opportunity for drug-taking. Moreover, by postulating that a perception of control can be generated to minimise unpleasant affective states, it can also reconcile contrasting models of decision-making and provide a neurological explanation for the efficacy of mindfulness-based techniques in treating addictions. With reference to the previously hypothesised link between the self and control, these ideas can provide an explanation for the increased subjective value of self-associated concepts in the 'endowment effect', as well as a neurological correlate for the concept of the 'narrative self'. This paper therefore provides an innovative and unifying perspective for the study and treatment of behavioural and substance addictions as well as contributing to our neurological understanding of philosophical approaches to the self. © 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Identification and validation of new functionally relevant and pharmacologically actionable targets for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a great challenge. Premalignant acinar cell reprogramming (acinar-to-ductal metaplasia [ADM]) is a precursor of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions that can progress to PDAC. This study investigated the role of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) in mutant Kras-induced and pancreatitis-associated ADM and PanIN formation, as well as in PDAC maintenance.; METHODS: Genetically engineered mouse models of mutant Kras (glycine 12 to aspartic acid) and Pyk2 deletion were used for investigating the role of PYK2 in PDAC genesis in mice. Invitro ADM assays were conducted using primary pancreatic acinar cells isolated from mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and a series of biochemical experiments were used to investigate upstream regulators/downstream targets of PYK2 in pancreatic carcinogenesis. PDAC cell line xenograft experiments were performed to study the role of PYK2 and its downstream target in PDAC maintenance.; RESULTS: PYK2 was increased substantially in ADM lesions induced by mutant Kras or inflammatory injury. Pyk2 deletion remarkably suppressed ADM and PanIN formation in a mutant Kras-driven and pancreatitis-associated PDAC model, whereas PYK2 knockdown substantially inhibited PDAC cell growth invitro and in nude mice. This study uncovered a novel yes-associated protein 1/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/PYK2/beta-catenin regulation axis in PDAC. Our results suggest that PYK2 contributes to PDAC genesis and maintenance by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through directly phosphorylating beta-cateninY654.; CONCLUSIONS: The current study uncovers PYK2 as a novel downstream effector of mutant KRAS signaling, a previously unrecognized mediator of pancreatitis-induced ADM and a novel intervention target for PDAC.

AB Objective: To ascertain how sleep health knowledge is translated to early care and education (ECE) programs, using a multi-component environmental scan. Methods: A website scan identified organizations' sleep content re: recommended practices, developmental effects, and "actionable" ratings (0-2). ECE staff surveys assessed preparedness, practices, and beliefs about addressing sleep health and sleep problems in ECE programs. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from the ECE, pediatric and sleep communities assessed awareness, priorities, and practices at their organizations. Results: Of 15 websites scanned, half lacked sleep content on links to development, optimal duration, or scientific background. ECE staff (n = 31) were comfortable speaking to parents about healthy sleep, and with incorporating sleep education and guidance into ECE. Stakeholders (n = 15) rated healthy sleep as a high relevance, but lower priority issue. Within ECE settings stakeholders reported that knowledge about specific links to health and development was poor and that sleep health was often obscured by "safe sleep" issues. Their recommendations included: linking sleep health to "hot topics" such as obesity or preschool suspensions and expulsions, integrating it with the teaching of routines, and raising public awareness. Conclusion: Despite understanding that healthy sleep promotes school readiness, there is insufficiently specific, actionable information in ECE training, programs, or policies. Findings suggest a need for an awareness campaign with clear, actionable messaging, dissemination of turnkey materials, and integration with policy and professional training systems.

AB Cardiac MR (CMR) is increasingly used to assess for cardiac involvement in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The frequent use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) has been called into question with reports of intracranial gadolinium deposition in patients receiving multiple administrations. We adopted a conservative GBCA administration policy, limiting the frequency of GBCA exposure in patients with previously documented late gadolinium enhancement. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical effects of this policy change. Data were retrospectively reviewed on 405 consecutive patients with DMD who underwent CMR evaluation. Patients were grouped into conservative GBCA administration or historical control. CMR reports were evaluated and clinical reports were reviewed to determine actionable changes. Ohio Medicaid reimbursements were used to estimate costs. A total of 187 patients comprised the conservative GBCA group and 218 patients the historical cohort. The conservative GBCA group had lower contrast administration rates (84% vs. 99%, p<0.0001), shorter scan times (35.2 vs. 39.0min, p<0.0001), and lower estimated medical costs ($339 vs. $351/study). There was no change regarding the initial presence of first-time late gadolinium enhancement, and no difference in actionable change. Contrast administration substantially decreased 7months post-policy change (65%) compared to the initial 7months (96%, p<0.0001). In the current era with unclear concern for intracranial gadolinium deposition, thoughtful GBCA administration is warranted in patients anticipated to undergo multiple CMRs. Our updated approach has resulted in fewer patients receiving contrast, shorter scan times, and less medical costs, without appreciable changes to patient management.

AB Recent estimates of the human proteome suggest there are 20,000 protein-coding genes, the protein products of which contain >145,000 phosphosites. Unfortunately, in-depth examination of the human phosphoproteome has outpaced the ability to annotate the kinases that mediate these post-translational modifications. To obtain actionable information about phosphorylation-driven signaling cascades, it is essential to identify the kinases responsible for phosphorylating sites that differ across disease states. To fill in these gaps we have developed an unbiased,chemoproteomic approach for identifying high-confidence kinase-substrate interactions with phosphosite specificity. Using this assay, we uncovered the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), a clinically validated kinase important for cell-cycle progression, in regulating cap-dependent translationvia phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor 4E-BP1. The discovery of this signaling axis sheds light on the mechanisms by which CDK4/6 inhibitors control cell proliferation and constitutes a successful example of kinase discovery using an activity-based, kinase-directed probe.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine predictors of early readmissions after radical cystectomy (RC). Factors associated with preventable readmissions may be most evident in readmissions that occur within 3days of discharge, commonly termed 'bounce-back' readmissions, and identifying such factors may inform efforts to reduce surgical readmissions.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We utilised the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Inpatient Databases to examine 1867 patients undergoing RC in 2009 and 2010, and identified all patients readmitted within 30days of discharge. We assessed differences between patients experiencing bounce-back readmission compared to those readmitted 8-30days after discharge using logistic regression models and also calculated abbreviated LACE scores to assess the utility of common readmissions risk stratification algorithms.; RESULTS: The 30-day and bounce-back readmission rates were 28.4% and 5.6%, respectively. Although no patient or index hospitalisation characteristics were significantly associated with bounce-back readmissions in adjusted analyses, bounce-back patients did have higher rates of gastrointestinal (14.3% vs 6.7%, P=0.02) and wound (9.5% vs 3.0%, P<0.01) diagnoses, as well as increased index and readmission length of stay (5 vs 4days, P=0.01). Overall, the median abbreviated LACE score was 7, which fell into the moderate readmission risk category, and no difference was observed between readmitted and non-readmitted patients.; CONCLUSION: One in five readmissions after RC occurs within 3days of initial discharge, probably due to factors present at discharge. However, sociodemographic and clinical factors, as well as traditional readmission risk tools were not predictive of this bounce-back. Effective strategies to reduce bounce-back readmission must identify actionable clinical factors prior to discharge. © 2019 The Authors BJU International © 2019 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: Although multiple self-monitoring technologies for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) show promise for improving T2DM self-care behaviors and clinical outcomes, they have been understudied in Hispanic adult populations who suffer disproportionately from T2DM.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and potential integration of wearable sensors for diabetes self-monitoring among Hispanic adults with self-reported T2DM.; METHODS: We conducted a pilot study of T2DM self-monitoring technologies among Hispanic adults with self-reported T2DM. Participants (n=21) received a real-time continuous glucose monitor (RT-CGM), a wrist-worn physical activity (PA) tracker, and a tablet-based digital food diary to self-monitor blood glucose, PA, and food intake, respectively, for 1 week. The RT-CGM captured viewable blood glucose concentration (mg/dL) and PA trackers collected accelerometer-based data, viewable on the device or an associated tablet app. After 1 week of use, we conducted a semistructured interview with each participant to understand experiences and thoughts on integration of the data from the devices into a technology-facilitated T2DM self-management intervention. We also conducted a brief written questionnaire to understand participants' self-reported T2DM history and past experience using digital health tools for T2DM self-management. Feasibility was measured by device utilization and objective RT-CGM, PA tracker, and diet logging data. Acceptability and potential integration were evaluated through thematic analysis of verbatim interview transcripts.; RESULTS: Participants (n=21, 76% female, 50.4 [SD 11] years) had a mean self-reported hemoglobin A1c of 7.4 [SD 1.8] mg/dL and had been diagnosed with T2DM for 7.4 [SD 5.2] years (range: 1-16 years). Most (89%) were treated with oral medications, whereas the others self-managed through diet and exercise. Nearly all participants (n=20) used both the RT-CGM and PA tracker, and 52% (11/21) logged at least one meal, with 33% (7/21) logging meals for 4 or more days. Of the 8 possible days, PA data were recorded for 7.1 [SD 1.8] days (range: 2-8), and participants averaged 7822 [SD 3984] steps per day. Interview transcripts revealed that participants felt most positive about the RT-CGM as it unveiled previously unknown relationships between lifestyle and health and contributed to changes in T2DM-related thoughts and behaviors. Participants felt generally positive about incorporating the wearable sensors and mobile apps into a future intervention if support were provided by a health coach or health care provider, device training were provided, apps were tailored to their language and culture, and content were both actionable and delivered on a single platform.; CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-based tools for facilitating T2DM self-monitoring appear to be a feasible and acceptable technology among low-income Hispanic adults. We identified barriers to acceptability and highlighted preferences for wearable sensor integration in a community-based intervention. These findings have implications for the design of T2DM interventions targeting Hispanic adults. ©Leah Yingling, Nancy A Allen, Michelle L Litchman, Vanessa Colicchio, Bryan S Gibson.

AB Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma is an uncommon aggressive type of endocervical adenocarcinoma that is not associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). At present, this tumor is classified under the spectrum of mucinous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The clinical stage of gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis is usually more advanced compared to the HPV-associated endocervical adenocarcinoma. Widespread dissemination to unusual sites, such as omentum, peritoneum, and distant organs, can be present. Owing to its rare incidence, diagnostic dilemmas, and aggressive behavior, clinical management can be challenging. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular characteristics of these tumors by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to assess 161 unique cancer-driver genes for single-nucleotide and copy-number variations, gene fusions, and insertions/deletions within gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma tumors. In total, 92 variants were detected across the 14 samples tested (7 variants on average per tumor). TP53 was the most recurrently mutated gene followed by MSH6, CDKN2A/B, POLE, SLX4, ARID1A, STK11, BRCA2, and MSH2. Abnormal p53 expression was observed in nine cases by immunohistochemistry, of which TP53 variants were present in four cases. MDM2 gene amplification in 12q15 (69202190-69233452) locus was seen in two cases that express normal p53 levels by immunohistochemistry. Four cases had STK11 null (frameshift/nonsense) variants, three of which were previously reported in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Overall, genes that are implicated in DNA damage, repair, cell cycle, Fanconi anemia pathway, and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathways were found to be mutated. Of note, genes known to have acquired and/or inherited variants in endometrial tumors were enriched within our cohort. In conclusion, our study shows the genetic heterogeneity of gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma with some potentially actionable molecular alterations, which highlights the importance of further molecular characterization for better identification of this rare entity, and hence better clinical management.

AB An improved understanding of the biochemical alterations that accompany tumor progression and metastasis is necessary to inform the next generation of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies. Metabolic reprogramming is known to occur during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that promotes metastasis. Here, we identify metabolic enzymes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling that are upregulated during EMT and are highly expressed in patients with aggressive mesenchymal-like breast cancer. Activation of EMT significantly increases production of hyaluronic acid, which is enabled by the reprogramming of glucose metabolism. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that depletion of the hyaluronic acid precursor UDP-glucuronic acid is sufficient to inhibit several mesenchymal-like properties including cellular invasion and colony formation in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We found that depletion of UDP-glucuronic acid altered the expression of PPAR-gamma target genes and increased PPAR-gamma DNA-binding activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that the disruption of EMT-induced metabolic reprogramming affects hyaluronic acid production, as well as associated extracellular matrix remodeling and represents pharmacologically actionable target for the inhibition of aggressive mesenchymal-like breast cancer progression.

AB Smallholder farmers might adopt different farming practices to cope with multiple stressors depending on their livelihood assets, and with varying environmental and economic outcomes. Ongoing global change is triggering stronger and different stressors that threaten conventional farming practices; however, this could be resolved if livelihood assets that drive decision making are actionable and thus can be modified. This study assessed the influence of farmers' livelihood assets, risk perception, and shocks on the choice of non-conventional farming practices for smallholder coffee farmers in San Martin, Peru. Using household survey data, we collected data on 162 coffee plantations along an elevation gradient. We operationalized the sustainable livelihoods framework for the adoption of shade and input coffee farming strategies and explored farmers' motives to change them. Despite associated high risks with pest and disease pressure, coffee price volatility and climate change, these risks did not explain the current shade and input farming strategies. While in the past five years, farmers adapted shade and input management in response to pest and disease and climate change pressures, these occurred in diverging directions: we found higher human and social assets associated with higher shade levels, and a trend for higher physical and financial assets associated with higher input use. These findings illustrate that two main factors affect decisions on farming practices related to shade and input management and they relate to different livelihood capitals. This suggests a potential for conflicting decision-making, push-and-pulling decisions in different directions. Further the disconnect between livelihood assets and perceptions suggests that perception of risk and shocks might not be sufficient to motivate decision making under changing conditions. Such insights in decision-making typologies and drivers can inform the development of farming practices that enhance resilience and sustainability of smallholder coffee production in Peru and elsewhere in the tropics.

AB BACKGROUND: Numerous driver mutations have been identified in colorectal cancer (CRC), but their relevance to the development of targeted therapies remains elusive. The secondary effects of pathogenic driver mutations on downstream signaling pathways offer a potential approach for the identification of therapeutic targets. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes as potential drug targets linked to driver mutations.; METHODS: Somatic mutations and the gene expression data of 582 CRC patients were utilized, incorporating the mutational status of 39,916 and the expression levels of 20,500 genes. To uncover candidate targets, the expression levels of various genes in wild-type and mutant cases for the most frequent disruptive mutations were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. A survival analysis was performed in 2100 patients with transcriptomic gene expression data. Up-regulated genes associated with worse survival were filtered for potentially actionable targets. The most significant hits were validated in an independent set of 171 CRC patients.; RESULTS: Altogether, 426 disruptive mutation-associated upregulated genes were identified. Among these, 95 were linked to worse recurrence-free survival (RFS). Based on the druggability filter, 37 potentially actionable targets were revealed. We selected seven genes and validated their expression in 171 patient specimens. The best independently validated combinations were DUSP4 (p = 2.6 * 10-12) in ACVR2A mutated (7.7%) patients; BMP4 (p = 1.6 * 10-04) in SOX9 mutated (8.1%) patients; TRIB2 (p = 1.35 * 10-14) in ACVR2A mutated patients; VSIG4 (p = 2.6 * 10-05) in ANK3 mutated (7.6%) patients, and DUSP4 (p = 7.1 * 10-04) in AMER1 mutated (8.2%) patients.; CONCLUSIONS: The results uncovered potentially druggable genes in colorectal cancer. The identified mutations could enable future patient stratification for targeted therapy.

AB This paper aims to contribute to the field of ambient intelligence from the perspective of real environments, where noise levels in datasets are significant, by showing how machine learning techniques can contribute to the knowledge creation, by promoting software sensors. The created knowledge can be actionable to develop features helping to deal with problems related to minimally labelled datasets. A case study is presented and analysed, looking to infer high-level rules, which can help to anticipate abnormal activities, and potential benefits of the integration of these technologies are discussed in this context. The contribution also aims to analyse the usage of the models for the transfer of knowledge when different sensors with different settings contribute to the noise levels. Finally, based on the authors' experience, a framework proposal for creating valuable and aggregated knowledge is depicted.

AB Professionals have expressed concerns about the quality of autism-related information available from Internet-based sources. The purpose of this study was to examine the source, content, usability, and actionability of autism spectrum disorder-related information contained in 100 different videos directed to families of children with autism spectrum disorder uploaded to YouTube. Upload sources were identified, and video content was coded. Understandability and actionability of the videos were examined using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials. The collective number of views of the videos was almost 100 million. The length of videos was 691.17 min (i.e. 11.5 h) with the shortest video being 30 s and the longest video being 37.36 min. The YouTube videos related to autism spectrum disorder covered a range of issues, although much of the content was focused on signs and symptoms. No difference in content reporting was noted based on sources for most categories, although differences were noted in some categories (e.g. professionals mentioned diagnosis and resources more frequently). Poor understandability and actionability scores (i.e. below 70%) were reported for all videos regardless of video source. However, the videos generated by the professionals were superior in terms of understandability. Study implications and recommendations for further research are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: Technology can play an important role in supporting mental health. Many studies have explored the effectiveness, acceptability, or context of use of different types of mental health technologies. However, existing research has tended to investigate single types of technology at a time rather than exploring a wider ecosystem that people may use. This narrow focus can limit our understanding of how we could best design mental health technologies.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate which technologies (smartphone apps, discussion forums and social media, and websites and Web-based programs) people use to support their mental health and why, whether they combine and use more than one technology, what purpose each technology serves, and which features people find the most valuable.; METHODS: We conducted an online survey to gather responses from members of the public who use technology to support their mental health and well-being. The survey was advertised on social media and via posters at a university. It explored usage patterns, frequently used features, and engagement with technology. To gain deeper insights into users' preferences, we also thematically analyzed open-ended comments about each technology type and suggestions for improvements provided by the respondents.; RESULTS: In total, 81 eligible participants completed the survey. Smartphone apps were the most commonly used technology, with 78% of the participants (63/81) using them, either alone (40%) or in combination with other technologies (38%). Each type of technology was used for specific purposes: apps provided guided activities, relaxation, and enabled tracking; social media and discussion forums allowed participants to learn from the experiences of others and use that knowledge to understand their own situation; and Web-based programs and websites helped to find out how to deal on a day-to-day basis with stress and anxiety. The analysis of open-ended responses showed that although many people valued technology and felt it could support targeted activities, it was not seen as a substitute for traditional face-to-face therapy. Participants wanted technology to be more sophisticated and nuanced, supporting personalized and actionable recommendations. There was evidence that participants mistrusted technology, irrespective of the type, and had broader concerns regarding the impact of overuse of technology.; CONCLUSIONS: People use different types of technology to support their mental health. Each can serve a specific purpose. Although apps are the most widely used technology, mixing and matching different types of technology is also common. Technology should not be seen as a replacement for traditional psychotherapy, rather it offers new opportunities to support mental health as part of an overall ecosystem. People want technology to be more nuanced and personalized to help them plan informed actions. Future interventions should explore the use of multiple technologies and their combined effects on mental health support. ©Katarzyna Stawarz, Chris Preist, David Coyle.

AB BACKGROUND: Continuous quality improvement in cancer care relies on the collection of accurate data on the quality of care provided. It is suggested that such an approach should: (i) measure the patient's care experience throughout the cancer trajectory; (ii) use items and response scales that measure concrete and specific aspects of care; (iii) minimise recall bias; (iv) minimise the burden placed on patients for providing data; (v) minimise administrative burden; and (vi) collect actionable data. The System for Patient Assessment of Cancer Experiences (SPACE) was developed to meet these objectives. This study describes the feasibility and acceptability of the SPACE in a sample of oncology outpatients.; METHODS: The SPACE was examined in four medical oncology centres. Adult patients were approached by a research assistant prior to their scheduled consultation. Consenting participants completed the SPACE on a computer tablet. Items were tailored to the patient's cancer treatment phase.; RESULTS: Of the eligible participants, 1143 consented (83%) and 1056 completed the survey (92%). The average time taken to complete the survey was 6min 28s. A large proportion of the sample indicated that the survey was acceptable (88-93% across three acceptability items).; CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the SPACE can be feasibly administered each time a patient comes to the oncology unit and is acceptable to patients. The SPACE could be used to quantify the care experiences which patients receive during their cancer care. The resulting data could be used to set benchmarks and improve the performance of cancer clinics.

AB Turbidity describes the cloudiness, or clarity, of a liquid. It is a principal indicator of water quality, sensitive to any suspended solids present. Prior work has identified the lack of low-cost turbidity monitoring as a significant hurdle to overcome to improve water quality in many domains, especially in the developing world. Low-cost hand-held benchtop meters have been proposed. This work adapts and verifies the technology for continuous monitoring. Lab tests show the low-cost continuous monitor can achieve 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) accuracy in the range 0-100 NTU and costs approximately 64 USD in components to construct. This level of accuracy yields useful and actionable data about water quality and may be sufficient in certain applications where cost is a primary constraint. A 38-day continuous monitoring trial, including a step change in turbidity, showed promising results with a median error of 0.45 and 1.40 NTU for two different monitors. However, some noise was present in the readings resulting in a standard deviation of 1.90 and 6.55 NTU, respectively. The cause was primarily attributed to ambient light and bubbles in the piping. By controlling these noise sources, we believe the low-cost continuous turbidity monitor could be a useful tool in multiple domains.

AB The oncogenic role ERBB2 amplification is well established in breast and gastric cancers. This has led to the development of a well-known portfolio of monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors targeting the ERBB2 kinase. More recently, activating mutations in the ERBB2 gene have been increasingly reported in multiple solid cancers and were shown to play an oncogenic role similar to that of ERBB2 amplification. Thus, ERBB2 mutations define a distinct molecular subtype of solid tumors and serve as actionable targets. However, efforts to target ERBB2 mutation has met with limited clinical success, possibly because of their low frequency, inadequate understanding of the biological activity of these mutations, and difficulty in separating the drivers from the passenger mutations. Given the current impetus to deliver molecularly targeted treatments for cancer, there is an important need to understand the therapeutic potential of ERBB2 mutations. Here we review the distribution of ERBB2 mutations in different tumor types, their potential as a novel biomarker that defines new subsets in many cancers, and current data on preclinical and clinical efforts to target these mutations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A current trend in oncology is to identify novel genomic drivers of solid tumors and developing precision treatments that target them. ERBB2 amplification is an established therapeutic target in breast and gastric cancers, but efforts to translate this finding to other solid tumors with ERBB2 amplification have not been effective. Recently the focus has turned to targeting activating ERBB2 mutations. The year 2018 marked an important milestone in establishing ERBB2 mutation as an important actionable target in multiple cancer types. There have been several recent preclinical and clinical studies evaluating ERBB2 mutation as a therapeutic target with varying success. With increasing access to next-generation sequencing technologies in the clinic, oncologists are frequently identifying activating ERBB2 mutations in patients with cancer. There is a significant need both from the clinician and bench scientist perspectives to understand the current state of affairs for ERBB2 mutations. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study aims to construct a model of the barriers to smoking cessation in the primary care setting.; DESIGN: Individual in-depth, semistructured interviews were audio-taped, then verbatim transcribed and translated when necessary. The data were first independently coded and then collectively discussed for emergent themes using the Straussian grounded theory method.; PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Fifty-seven current smokers were recruited from a previous smoking related study carried out in a primary care setting in Malaysia. Current smokers with at least one failed quit attempts were included.; RESULTS: A five-theme model emerged from this grounded theory method. (1) Personal and lifestyle factors: participants were unable to resist the temptation to smoke; (2) Nicotine addiction: withdrawal symptoms could not be overcome; (3) Social cultural norms: participants identified accepting cigarettes from friends as a token of friendship to be problematic; (4) Misconception: perception among smokers that ability to quit was solely based on one's ability to achieve mind control, and perception that stopping smoking will harm the body and (5) Failed assisted smoking cessation: smoking cessation services were not felt to be user-friendly and were poorly understood. The themes were organised into five concentric circles based on time frame: those actionable in the short term (themes 1 and 2) and the long term (themes 3, 4, 5).; CONCLUSIONS: Five themes of specific beliefs and practices prevented smokers from quitting. Clinicians need to work on these barriers, which can be guided by the recommended time frames to help patients to succeed in smoking cessation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB In the era of data-rich medicine, an increasing number of domains of people's lives are datafied and rendered usable for health care purposes. Yet, deriving insights for clinical practice and individual life choices and deciding what data or information should be used for this purpose pose difficult challenges that require tremendous time, resources, and skill. Thus, big data not only promises new clinical insights but also generates new-and heretofore largely unarticulated-forms of work for patients, families, and health care providers alike. Building on science studies, medical informatics, Anselm Strauss and colleagues' concept of patient work, and subsequent elaborations of articulation work, in this article, we analyze the forms of work engendered by the need to make data and information actionable for the treatment decisions and lives of individual patients. We outline three areas of data work, which we characterize as the work of supporting digital data practices, the work of interpretation and contextualization, and the work of inclusion and interaction. This is a first step toward naming and making visible these forms of work in order that they can be adequately seen, rewarded, and assessed in the future. We argue that making data work visible is also necessary to ensure that the insights of big and diverse datasets can be applied in meaningful and equitable ways for better health care. ©Amelia Fiske, Barbara Prainsack, Alena Buyx.

AB Attenuated adenomatous polyposis (AAP) is a heterogeneous syndrome in terms of clinical manifestations, heritability and etiology of the disease. Genetic heterogeneity and low penetrance alleles are probably the best explanation for this variability. Certainly, it is known that APC and MUTYH are high penetrance predisposition genes for adenomatous polyposis, but they only account for 5-10% of AAP. Other new predisposition genes, such as POLE, POLD1, NTHL1, AXIN2 or MSH3, have been recently described and have been associated with AAP, but their relative contribution is still not well defined. In order to evaluate the genetic predisposition to AAP in a hospital based population, germline DNAs from 158 AAP subjects were screened for genetic variants in the coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of seven associated genes through a next-generation sequencing (NGS) custom gene panel. Splicing, segregation studies, somatic mutational screening and RNA quantitative expression assays were conducted for selected variants. In four of the probands the adenoma susceptibility could be explained by actionable mutations in APC or MUTYH, and one other patient was a double carrier of two truncating variants in both POLE and NTHL1. Furthermore, 16 additional patients harbored uncertain significance variants in the remaining tested genes. This report gives information about the contribution of the newly described adenomatous polyposis predisposition genes in a Spanish attenuated polyposis cohort. Our results highly support the convenience of NGS multigene panels for attenuated polyposis genetic screening and reveals POLE frameshift variants as a plausible susceptibility mechanism for AAP.

AB Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy throughout the world, with wide geographical variance. It is the subtype of biliary tract malignancy that has the poorest prognosis and lower survival among all biliary tract malignancies. Various factors are associated with GBC pathogenesis such as environmental, microbial, metabolic and molecular. Chronic inflammation of gallbladder due to presence of gallstone or microbial infection (eg. Salmonella or H. pylori) results in sustained production of inflammatory mediators in the tissue microenvironment, which can cause genomic changes linked to carcinogenesis. Genetic alterations are one of the major factors, associated with aggressiveness and prognosis. Researches have been done to explore suitable biomarker for early diagnosis and identify altered molecular pathways to develop appropriate biomarkers for early diagnosis, therapy and predicting prognosis. Different agents for targeted therapy against actionable mutations of molecules like EGFR, VEGF, mTOR, HER2, PDL-1, PD-1, MET, PI3K, N-cadherin, VEGFR, MEK1 and MEK2 are being tried. Despite these advancements, there is dismal improvement in the survival of GBC patients. Genetic aberrations other than actionable mutations and epigenetic modification including aberrant expressions of micro-RNAs, are also being studied both as diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic targets. Complex pathogenesis of GBC still needs to be unfolded. In this review we focus on the molecular pathogenesis of GBC elucidated till date along with future directions that can be explored to achieve better management of GBC patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Analysis of melanomas for actionable mutations has become the standard of care. Recently, a classification scheme has been proposed that categorizes BRAF mutations based on their mechanisms for activation of the MAPK pathway.; METHODS: In this analysis BRAF, KIT, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations were examined by next generation sequencing (NGS) in 446 melanomas in a clinical diagnostic setting. KRAS and HRAS were also analyzed to elucidate coexisting BRAF and RAS mutations. BRAF mutations were categorized into class-1 (kinase-activated, codon 600), class-2 (kinase-activated, non-codon 600) and class-3 (kinase-impaired), based on the newly proposed classification scheme.; RESULTS: NGS demonstrated high analytic sensitivity. Among 355 mutations detected, variant allele frequencies were 2-5% in 21 (5.9%) mutations and 2-10% in 47 (13%) mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (42%), NRAS (25%), KIT (4.9%) and PIK3CA (2.7%). The incidence of class-1, class-2 and class-3 mutations were 33% (26% p.V600E and 6.1% p.V600K), 3.1 and 4.9% respectively. With a broader reportable range of NGS, class-1, class-2 and class-3 mutations accounted for 77, 7.4 and 12% of all BRAF mutations. Class-3 mutations, commonly affecting codons 594, 466 and 467, showed a higher incidence of coexisting RAS mutations, consistent with their RAS-dependent signaling. Significant association with old age and primary tumors of head/neck/upper back suggest chronic solar damage as a contributing factor for melanomas harboring BRAF p.V600K or class-3 mutations.; CONCLUSION: This study categorizes the range, frequency, coexisting driver mutations and clinical characteristics of the three classes of BRAF mutations in a large cohort of melanomas in a clinical diagnostic setting. Further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical outcomes and benefits of newly developed targeted therapy in melanoma patients carrying each class of BRAF mutation.

AB BACKGROUND: The rapid deterioration observed in the condition of some hospitalized patients can be attributed to either disease progression or imperfect triage and level of care assignment after their admission. An early warning system (EWS) to identify patients at high risk of subsequent intrahospital death can be an effective tool for ensuring patient safety and quality of care and reducing avoidable harm and costs.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively validate a real-time EWS designed to predict patients at high risk of inpatient mortality during their hospital episodes.; METHODS: Data were collected from the system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) of two acute Berkshire Health System hospitals, comprising 54,246 inpatient admissions from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017, of which 2.30% (1248/54,246) resulted in intrahospital deaths. Multiple machine learning methods (linear and nonlinear) were explored and compared. The tree-based random forest method was selected to develop the predictive application for the intrahospital mortality assessment. After constructing the model, we prospectively validated the algorithms as a real-time inpatient EWS for mortality.; RESULTS: The EWS algorithm scored patients' daily and long-term risk of inpatient mortality probability after admission and stratified them into distinct risk groups. In the prospective validation, the EWS prospectively attained a c-statistic of 0.884, where 99 encounters were captured in the highest risk group, 69% (68/99) of whom died during the episodes. It accurately predicted the possibility of death for the top 13.3% (34/255) of the patients at least 40.8 hours before death. Important clinical utilization features, together with coded diagnoses, vital signs, and laboratory test results were recognized as impactful predictors in the final EWS.; CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we prospectively demonstrated the capability of the newly-designed EWS to monitor and alert clinicians about patients at high risk of in-hospital death in real time, thereby providing opportunities for timely interventions. This real-time EWS is able to assist clinical decision making and enable more actionable and effective individualized care for patients' better health outcomes in target medical facilities. ©Chengyin Ye, Oliver Wang, Modi Liu, Le Zheng, Minjie Xia, Shiying Hao, Bo Jin, Hua Jin, Chunqing Zhu, Chao Jung Huang, Peng Gao, Gray Ellrodt, Denny Brennan, Frank Stearns, Karl G Sylvester, Eric Widen, Doff B McElhinney, Xuefeng Ling.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Poor disease recognition may jeopardize the safety of CKD care. We examined safety events and outcomes in patients with CKD piloting a medical-alert accessory intended to improve disease recognition and an observational subcohort from the same population.; DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We recruited 350 patients with stage 2-5 predialysis CKD. The first (pilot) 108 participants were given a medical-alert accessory (bracelet or necklace) indicating the diagnosis of CKD and displaying a website with safe CKD practices. The subsequent (observation) subcohort (n=242) received usual care. All participants underwent annual visits with ascertainment of patient-reported events (class 1) and actionable safety findings (class 2). Secondary outcomes included 50% GFR reduction, ESKD, and death. Cox proportional hazards assessed the association of the medical-alert accessory with outcomes.; RESULTS: Median follow-up of pilot and observation subcohorts were 52 (interquartile range, 44-63) and 37 (interquartile range, 27-47) months, respectively. The frequency of class 1 and class 2 safety events reported at annual visits was not different in the pilot versus observation group, with 108.7 and 100.6 events per 100 patient-visits (P=0.13), and 38.3 events and 41.2 events per 100 patient visits (P=0.23), respectively. The medical-alert accessory was associated with lower crude and adjusted rate of ESKD versus the observation group (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.89; and hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.94, respectively). The association of the medical-alert accessory with the composite endpoint of ESKD or 50% reduction GFR was variable over time but appeared to have an early benefit (up to 23 months) with its use. There was no significant difference in incidence of hospitalization, death, or a composite of all outcomes between medical-alert accessory users and the observational group.; CONCLUSIONS: The medical-alert accessory was not associated with incidence of safety events but was associated with a lower rate of ESKD relative to usual care.

AB The role of mitochondria in cancer continues to be debated, and whether exploitation of mitochondrial functions is a general hallmark of malignancy or a tumor- or context-specific response is still unknown. Using a variety of cancer cell lines and several technical approaches, including siRNA-mediated gene silencing, ChIP assays, global metabolomics and focused metabolite analyses, bioenergetics, and cell viability assays, we show that two oncogenic Myc proteins, c-Myc and N-Myc, transcriptionally control the expression of the mitochondrial chaperone TNFR-associated protein-1 (TRAP1) in cancer. In turn, this Myc-mediated regulation preserved the folding and function of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex II and IV subunits, dampened reactive oxygen species production, and enabled oxidative bioenergetics in tumor cells. Of note, we found that genetic or pharmacological targeting of this pathway shuts off tumor cell motility and invasion, kills Myc-expressing cells in a TRAP1-dependent manner, and suppresses primary and metastatic tumor growth in vivo We conclude that exploitation of mitochondrial functions is a general trait of tumorigenesis and that this reliance of cancer cells on mitochondrial OXPHOS pathways could offer an actionable therapeutic target in the clinic. © 2019 Agarwal et al.

AB BACKGROUND: Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) is a recommendation in international clinical practice guidelines given its' benefits, however use is suboptimal. The purpose of this position statement was to translate evidence on interventions that increase CR enrolment and adherence into implementable recommendations.; METHODS: The writing panel was constituted by representatives of societies internationally concerned with preventive cardiology, and included disciplines that would be implementing the recommendations. Patient partners served, as well as policy-makers. The statement was developed in accordance with AGREE II, among other guideline checklists. Recommendations were based on our update of the Cochrane review on interventions to promote patient utilization of CR. These were circulated to panel members, who were asked to rate each on a 7-point Likert scale in terms of scientific acceptability, actionability, and feasibility of assessment. A web call was convened to achieve consensus and confirm strength of the recommendations (based on GRADE). The draft underwent external review and public comment.; RESULTS: The 3 drafted recommendations were that to increase enrolment, healthcare providers, particularly nurses (strong), should promote CR to patients face-to-face (strong), and that to increase adherence part of CR could be delivered remotely (weak). Ratings for the 3 recommendations were 5.95 ± 0.69 (mean ± standard deviation), 5.33 ± 1.12 and 5.64 ± 1.08, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Interventions can significantly increase utilization of CR, and hence should be widely applied. We call upon cardiac care institutions to implement these strategies to augment CR utilization, and to ensure CR programs are adequately resourced to serve enrolling patients and support them to complete programs.

AB The goal of this project was to assess usability and acceptance of a web-based tool after iterative development based on cognitive walkthroughs. The website is a "Research Roadmap", modeled after the NYC Subway map, and designed to help the user navigate the complex structure of research at a large multi-institution organization. A mixed process of evaluation and design was applied; after an initial survey phase, the website was revised, then another cycle of feedback was implemented. Surveys consisted of standardized questions with answers arranged as Likert-type scales and additional written responses. The first phase of survey feedback shaped overall design of the tool. The second phase measured task performance (time-to-completion), perceived ease-of-use, and satisfaction. These ongoing cycles of cognitive walkthroughs provided actionable data that led to redesign of the tool, an improved interface, improved user satisfaction, and 'above average' usability (top 10th percentile) as measured by the System Usability Scale.

AB Stimuli responsive hosts for C60 can control its binding and release on demand. A photoswitchable TPE based supramolecular host can encapsulate C60 in the Z-form with a markedly different visual change in the colour. In addition, the Z-1 bound C60 has been characterized by various spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. Upon exposure to visible light (>490nm), the host switches to the E-form where the structural complementarity with the guest is destroyed as a result of which the C60 is disassembled from the host. The results described herein reveals an actionable roadmap to pursue further advances in component self-assembly particularly light-induced association and dissociation of a guest molecule.

AB Background: Women in academic medicine are not attaining parity with men in several domains. This issue is not only one of fairness; some funding agencies are requesting data on gender benchmarking. However, most published reports on gender disparities have not included examination of trends or actionable recommendations to address them. Materials and Methods: The Dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine charged the Committee on the Status of Women (CSW) with conducting a comprehensive review of gender equity. In 2014, the CSW identified key domains important for academic success and created a sustainable framework to monitor trends by gender. Utilizing data from multiple key sources, the CSW measured differences in the domains of academic promotion, leadership, and satisfaction. Results: Gender differences were present in each domain. Data were not centralized and not readily available for most domains. The CSW recommended strategies to address gender disparities and created a set of measurable recommendations to monitor progress. The recommendations include requiring detailed descriptions of departmental organizational leadership charts; diverse compositions of both search committees and applicant pools; increased proportion of female faculty in top-tier leadership positions; and transparent departmental promotions criteria and processes. Conclusions: To maintain progress, we recommend that data be readily and easily accessible from a central institutional registry rather than come from multiple sources, that data be analyzed on a regular basis, and that results be shared across the institution to ensure transparency and accountability.

AB Improvements in systemic therapy are translating into more patients living longer with metastatic disease. Bone is the most common site of metastasis, where spinal lesions can result in significant pain impacting quality of life and possible neurological dysfunction resulting in a decline in performance status. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of the spine has emerged as a promising technique to provide durable local control, palliation of symptoms, control of oligoprogressive sites of disease, and possibly augment the immune response. SBRT achieves this by delivering highly conformal radiation therapy to allow for dose escalation due to a steep dose gradient from the planning target volume to nearby critical organs at risk. In our review, we provide an in-depth review and expert commentary regarding seminal literature that defined clinically meaningful toxicity endpoints with actionable dosimetric limits and/or clinical management strategies to mitigate toxicity potentially attributable to SBRT of the spine. We placed a spotlight on radiation myelopathy (de novo, reirradiation after conventional external beam radiation therapy or salvage after an initial course of spinal SBRT), plexopathy, vertebral compression fracture, pain flare, esophageal toxicity, myositis, and safety regarding combination with concurrent targeted or immune therapies.

AB In this article, we sought to understand the adaptive challenges and work faced by men with male factor infertility. Using a prospective qualitative study in private (the United States) and academic (the United Kingdom) urology clinics, we recruited seven American and five British men with primary infertility after their urology consultation for male factor infertility between December 2015 and April 2017. Individual in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted shortly after male factor infertility urology consultation and then two additional interviews at about 3 and 6months. We found three themes related to adaptive challenges faced during fertility treatment: avoidance (not disclosing, avoided social network), uncertainty (about ability to have a child, fertility-related information, and male factor infertility status), and affective symptoms (sadness, shock, disbelief, denial, about not achieving fatherhood, and poor outcomes). Four themes about adaptive work included focusing on goal (having clear, actionable steps; knowledge received from urologist; exhausted all options; focus on parenthood), support from partner (relationship and communication), support from health care team (provision of emotional support, increased comfort with staff over time, disclosure of knowing others with same condition), and acquired information (understanding issue, support from urologist, seeking information). We concluded that men with male factor infertility face adaptive challenges including avoidance, uncertainty, and affective symptoms. To manage during the treatment process, they use adaptive work including focusing on the goal, receiving support from their partner and health care team, and acquiring information. Although qualitative results cannot be generalized to larger populations, they might be applicable to men with male factor infertility during infertility treatment.

AB Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, cloud computing, and data-driven techniques together offer a great opportunity for verticals such as dairy industry to increase productivity by getting actionable insights to improve farming practices, thereby increasing efficiency and yield. In this paper, we present SmartHerd, a fog computing-assisted end-to-end IoT platform for animal behavior analysis and health monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. The platform follows a microservices-oriented design to assist the distributed computing paradigm and addresses the major issue of constrained Internet connectivity in remote farm locations. We present the implementation of the designed software system in a 6-month mature real-world deployment, wherein the data from wearables on cows is sent to a fog-based platform for data classification and analysis, which includes decision-making capabilities and provides actionable insights to farmer towards the welfare of animals. With fog-based computational assistance in the SmartHerd setup, we see an 84% reduction in amount of data transferred to the cloud as compared with the conventional cloud-based approach.

AB Background: Unaddressed high distress leads to noncompliance with treatment, negatively affects quality of life, and may also have a negative impact on the prognosis of cancer patients. Patients with brain tumors have higher levels of distress than the general population and hence we hypothesize that even routine visits during adjuvant treatment or follow-up are likely to be stressful. This analysis was performed to identify the incidence of distress and factors affecting it.; Methods: This was an audit of 84 consecutive patients seen in an adult neuro-medical oncology outpatient department who were either receiving adjuvant chemotherapy or were on follow-up. Distress screening with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) distress thermometer was performed. Patients in whom distress was scored as 4 or above were considered as having high distress. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify factors affecting distress.; Results: The median age of the cohort was 40 years (interquartile range, 28.3 to 50 years). Actionable distress defined as a distress score of 4 or more was seen in 52 patients (61.9%, 95% CI 51.2% to 71.5%). Presence of physical deficit (odds ratio [OR] = 3.412, P = .020) and treatment under the private category (OR = 5.273, P = .003) had higher odds of having high distress.; Conclusion: A high proportion of brain tumor patients either on adjuvant chemotherapy or on follow-up have high distress levels that need to be addressed even during follow-up.

AB Deaths related to pregnancy were relatively common in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century. A dramatic reduction of 99% in maternal mortality rate, from 850.0-7.5 per 100,000 live births from 1900-1982, is 1 of the most noteworthy public health success stories of the time period. This plateau continued until the late 1990s when the maternal mortality rate began to rise again. The reasons for this increase are unclear. Vital statistics data alone cannot answer the many questions surrounding this increase. The need for detailed and reliable information about causes of death and underlying factors has led to the development of state- and urban-based maternal death reviews. Although processes may vary, an expert panel is convened to review individual cases and make recommendations for systems change. Review of maternal deaths is considered to be a core public health function. There are multiple purposes for this article. The first goal is to highlight the components of a maternal mortality review. The second goal is to provide an example for new review committees. A mock case of cardiomyopathy is used to illustrate both the process and development of actionable recommendations for clinical intervention. Recommendations to address community- and system-level contributing factors and the social determinants of health are discussed. The third goal is to educate providers regarding presentation and management of cardiomyopathy. Fourth, it is hoped that policymakers in the area of maternal health and facilities that review maternal morbidity and mortality rates at the institutional level will find the article useful as well. Finally, the article provides facility-level committees with a process example for review of the circumstances of maternal deaths beyond clinical factors so that they may make recommendations to address nonclinical contributors to pregnancy-related deaths. Documenting both clinical and nonclinical contributors to maternal death are critical to influence public opinion, develop coalitions for collective impact, and engage at risk populations in proposing interventions.

AB Widely available molecular profiling technology, including next-generation sequencing has changed the landscape of drug development in cancer. An increasing number of clinical trials in early drug development require patient selection based on molecular alterations. Concurrently, efforts to identify molecular alterations in tumors that exhibited exceptional response after systemic treatment with standard or investigational agents have been published or are in progress. These discoveries may ultimately serve as predictive markers or "actionable mutations" for future therapies. To test the feasibility of collecting the archival tissues from proposed exceptional responder patients and successful subsequent molecular profiling, the National Cancer Institute opened a nationwide exceptional responder initiative protocol in 2014. In addition, an increasing number of exceptional responder cases have been identified and published from academia institutions. The Network of Enigmatic Exceptional Responders study uses crowdsourcing to identify exceptional responders and will molecularly profile tumors to discern molecular correlates with exceptional response. In this review, we discuss the potential role of exceptional responder molecular analysis in new biomarker discovery efforts to further advance precision medicine in oncology therapeutics.

AB Cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) and mimicking circulating tumor cells (mCTCs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for molecular diagnosis of cancer and have been rapidly implemented in specific settings. However, widespread clinical adoption still faces some obstacles. The purpose was to compare the performance of a BEAMing (beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics) assay (OncoBEAM-epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] [Sysmex Inostics]) and a next-generation sequencing assay (NGS; 56G Oncology panel kit, Swift Bioscience) to detect the p.T790M EGFR mutation in cfDNA of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. CfDNA samples (n=183) were collected within our hospital from patients having a known EGFR sensitizing mutation, and presenting disease progression while under first-line therapy. EGFR mutations were detected using NGS in 42.1% of samples during progression in cfDNA. Testing using the OncoBEAM-EGFR assay enabled detection of the p.T790M EGFR mutation in 40/183 NSCLC patients (21.8%) versus 20/183 (10.9%), using the NGS assay. Samples that were only positive with the OncoBEAM-EGFR assay had lower mutant allelic fractions (Mean=0.1304%; SD±0.1463%). In addition, we investigated the detection of p.T790M in mCTCs using H1975 cells. These cells spiked into whole blood were enriched using the ClearCellFX1 microfluidic device. Using the OncoBEAM-EGFR assay, p.T790M was detected in as few as 1.33 tumoral cells/mL. Overall, these findings highlight the value of using the OncoBEAM-EGFR to optimize detection of the p.T790M mutation, as well as the complementary clinical value that each of the mutation detection assay offers: NGS enabled the detection of mutations in other oncogenes that may be relevant to secondary resistance mechanisms, whereas the OncoBEAM-EGFR assay achieved higher sensitivity for detection of clinically actionable mutations. © 2019 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND: Many patients have difficulty understanding and adhering to discharge instructions once home from hospital. We assessed patient and family caregiver perspectives on factors that influence understanding of and adherence to discharge instructions.; METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews of participants aged 18 years or more enrolled in a multicentre mixed-methods study who were discharged from 3 acute care hospitals across Ontario with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumonia. Patients were recruited between March and November 2016. We used directed content analysis to derive themes and subthemes.; RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants (16 patients and 11 family members) described 5 themes that affected their understanding of and adherence to discharge instructions: 1) the role of caregivers, 2) relationships with inpatient and outpatient health care providers, 3) previous hospital stay, 4) barriers to accessing postdischarge care and 5) system-level processes. Subthemes highlighted the importance participants attributed to who provides the instructions, the development of resilience and advocacy through previous admissions, the benefits of addressing language and physical disability barriers, reviewing instructions in a unhurried manner, and ensuring that written instructions are meaningful and actionable.; INTERPRETATION: Care transition interventions targeting improved communication are unlikely to improve understanding of and adherence to discharge instructions on their own. A patient-centred framework that promotes positive relationships with a patient's circle of care, reflects previous experiences with discharge, addresses equity barriers, and enhances strategies for patient and caregiver engagement at the time of discharge may optimize understanding and adherence once the patient is home.

AB The increased number of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is of great clinical relevance and involves a large burden of the healthcare system. The management of these patients is focused on relieving symptoms and improving clinical outcomes. Therefore, the ideal test would provide the correct diagnosis and actionable information. To this aim, several non-invasive functional imaging modalities are usually used as gatekeeper to invasive coronary angiography, but their diagnostic performance remains low with limited accuracy when compared to obstructive CAD at the time of invasive coronary angiography or invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) assessment. For these reasons, an urgent need for non-invasive techniques that evaluate both the functional and morphological severity of CAD is growing. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a unique non-invasive technique providing coronary artery anatomic imaging. More recently, the evaluation of FFR with CCTA (FFRCT) has demonstrated high diagnostic performance compared to invasive FFR. Moreover, this tool has been proven to be more cost-effective than standard diagnostic pathways in large prospective multicenter trials, and to have a prognostic role. Additionally, stress myocardial computed tomography perfusion (stress CTP) represents a novel tool for the diagnosis of ischemia with high diagnostic accuracy. With advances in technical development, both static and dynamic computed tomography myocardial perfusion protocols offer functional assessment with an acceptable increase in radiation exposure. Compared to other imaging techniques, both FFRCT and stress CTP allow the combination of the anatomical evaluation of coronary arteries and the functional relevance of coronary artery lesions, having the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic paradigm of suspected CAD. FFRCT and stress CTP should be integrated in diagnostic pathways of patients with stable CAD and will likely result in a decrease of invasive diagnostic procedures and costs.

AB INTRODUCTION: The major complication of protein replacement therapy for haemophilia A is the development of anti-FVIII antibodies or inhibitors that occur in 25%-30% of persons with severe haemophilia A. Alternative therapeutics such as bypassing agents or immune tolerance induction protocols have additional challenges and are not always effective.; AIM: Assemble a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) State of the Science (SOS) Workshop to generate a national blueprint for research on inhibitors to solve the problem of FVIII immunogenicity.; METHODS: An Executive Steering Committee was formed in October 2017 to establish the scientific focus and Scientific Working Groups for the SOS Workshop in May 2018. Four working groups were assembled to address scientific priorities in basic, translational and clinical research on inhibitors.; RESULTS: Working Group 1 was charged with determining the scientific priorities for clinical trials to include the integration of non-intravenous, non-factor therapeutics including gene therapy into the standard of care for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors. Working Group 2 established the scientific priorities for 21st-century data science and biospecimen collection for observational inhibitor cohort studies. The scientific priorities for acquiring an actionable understanding of FVIII immunogenicity and the immunology of the host response and FVIII tolerance were developed by Working Group 3. Working Group 4 designed prospective pregnancy/birth cohorts to study FVIII immunogenicity, inhibitor development and eradication.; CONCLUSION: The NHLBI SOS Workshop generated a focused summary of scientific priorities and implementation strategies to overcome the challenges of eradicating and preventing inhibitors in haemophilia A. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Purpose: Implementing team-based care into existing primary care is challenging; understanding facilitators and barriers to implementation is critical. We assessed adoption and acceptability of new roles in the first 6months of launching a team-based care model focused on preventive care, population health, and psychosocial support.; Methods: We conducted qualitative rapid ethnography at a community-based test clinic, including 74hours of observations and 28 semi-structured interviews. We identified implementation themes related to team-based care and specifically the integration of three roles purposively designed to enhance coordination for better patient outcomes, including preventive screening and mental health: (1) medical assistants as care coordinators; (2) extended care team specialists, including clinical pharmacist and behavioral health professional; and (3) advanced practice providers (APPs)-ie, nurse practitioners and physician assistants.; Results: All stakeholders (ie, patients, providers, and staff) reported positive perceptions of care coordinators and extended care specialists; these roles were well defined and quickly implemented. Care coordinators effectively managed care between visits and established strong patient relationships. Specialist colocation facilitated patient access and well-supported diabetes services and mental health care. We also observed unanticipated value: Care coordinators relayed encounter-relevant chart information to providers while scribing; extended care specialists supported informal continuing medical education. In contrast, we observed uncertain definition and expectations of the APP role across stakeholders; accordingly, adoption and acceptability of the role varied.; Conclusions: Practice redesign can redistribute responsibility and patient connection throughout a team but should emphasize well-defined roles. Ethnography, conducted early in implementation with multistakeholder perspectives, can provide rapid and actionable insights about where roles may need refinement or redefinition to support ultimate physical and mental health outcomes for patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Rapid qualitative assessment was used to describe early strategies to implement an evidence-based walking program for hospitalized older adults, assiSTed eaRly mobIlity for hospitalizeD older vEterans (STRIDE), mandated by a regional Department of Veterans Affairs health care system office (Veterans Integrated Service Network [VISN]).; METHODS: Data were collected from 6 hospital sites via semistructured interviews with key informants, observations of telephone-based technical assistance, and review of VISN-requested program documents (eg, initial implementation plans). An overarching framework of actionable feedback for VISN leadership and specification of locally initiated implementation strategies, using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) compilation, was used. Actionable feedback was shared with VISN leadership 1 month after the initiative.; RESULTS: ERIC implementation strategies identified were as follows: (1) promoting adaptability-4 sites had physical therapists/kinesiotherapists instead of assistants walk patients; (2) promoting network weaving-strengthening nursing and PT/KT partnership with regular communication opportunities or a point person was important for implementation; (3) distributing educational materials-2 sites distributed information about STRIDE via e-mail and in person; and (4) organizing clinician implementation team meetings-3 sites used interdisciplinary team meetings to communicate with the clinical staff about STRIDE.; CONCLUSION: This qualitative study sheds light on early experiences with implementing STRIDE; the results have been instructive for ongoing implementation and future dissemination of STRIDE, and the approach can be applied across contexts to inform implementation of other programs.

AB BACKGROUND: A universal approach to health literacy employs clear communication and emphasizes patient action in support of understanding cardiovascular risks and making healthy lifestyle changes. The aim of this project was to evaluate the impact of a health literacy module on enhancing students' written patient education material using standardized readability assessment tools.; EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY: A professional elective course employed team-based learning and a community health fair activity. The course was enhanced with four hours of health literacy content. Pharmacy student learners were assigned a cardiovascular condition and designed an informational pamphlet. Two faculty members evaluated the student pamphlets in the pre-health literacy module (n = 15) and post-module (n = 23) groups using the Flesch grade level, Flesch reading ease score, and 15 health literacy criteria identified from previous literature.; CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY: There was a modest integration of health literacy concepts based on the Flesch grade level and the mean total health literacy criteria achieved. Student learners improved in areas of readability, message content, numeracy/statistics, and patient actionability concepts. Simplifying technical jargon remains to be a barrier. The results will be used to improve our health literacy pamphlet rubric and classroom instruction. The health literacy module was valuable in fostering understanding and application of health literacy concepts, and preparing student learners for providing patient-centered communication.

AB OBJECTIVES: After a 500 ms presentation, experts can distinguish abnormal mammograms at above chance levels even when only the breast contralateral to the lesion is shown. Here, we show that this signal of abnormality is detectable 3 years before localized signs of cancer become visible.; METHODS: In 4 prospective studies, 59 expert observers from 3 groups viewed 116-200 bilateral mammograms for 500 ms each. Half of the images were prior exams acquired 3 years prior to onset of visible, actionable cancer and half were normal. Exp. 1D included cases having visible abnormalities. Observers rated likelihood of abnormality on a 0-100 scale and categorized breast density. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic analysis.; RESULTS: In all three groups, observers could detect abnormal images at above chance levels 3 years prior to visible signs of breast cancer (p < 0.001). The results were not due to specific salient cases nor to breast density. Performance was correlated with expertise quantified by the number of mammographic cases read within a year. In Exp. 1D, with cases having visible actionable pathology included, the full group of readers failed to reliably detect abnormal priors; with the exception of a subgroup of the six most experienced observers.; CONCLUSIONS: Imaging specialists can detect signals of abnormality in mammograms acquired years before lesions become visible. Detection may depend on expertise acquired by reading large numbers of cases.; ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Global gist signal can serve as imaging risk factor with the potential to identify patients with elevated risk for developing cancer, resulting in improved early cancer diagnosis rates and improved prognosis for females with breast cancer.

AB This study uses observational causal inference to evaluate the impact of different combinations of home care services (nursing, therapies, social work, home aides) on end-of-episode disposition for individuals with chronic diseases associated with the circulatory, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. The potential to generate actionable recommendations for personalizing home care services, or treatment plans, from limited clinical and care needs data is demonstrated. For patients with chronic disease in the circulatory or musculoskeletal systems, a 2.91% and 3.38% decrease, respectively, in acute care hospitalization rates could be obtained by providing patients with therapy and nursing services, rather than therapy services alone.

AB Background: Focused transthoracic echocardiography has been used to determine etiologies of cardiac arrest and evaluate utility of continuing resuscitation after cardiac arrest. Few guidelines exist advising ultrasound timing within the advanced cardiac life support algorithm. Natural timing of echocardiography occurs during the pulse check, when views are unencumbered by stabilization equipment or vigorous movements. However, recent studies suggest that ultrasound performance during pulse checks prolongs the pause duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Transesophageal echocardiography studies have demonstrated benefits in this regard, but there have been no transthoracic echocardiography studies assessing the physical performance of compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe cases where echocardiography performed at the beginning of the cardiac arrest algorithm offers actionable information to cardiopulmonary resuscitation itself without delaying provision of compressions. Conclusion: Providers using focused echocardiography to evaluate cardiac arrest patients should consider initiating scans at the start of compressions to identify the optimal location for compression delivery and to detect inadequate compressions. Subsequent visualization of full left ventricular compression may be seen after a location change, and combined with end tidal carbon dioxide values, gives indication for improved forward circulatory flow. Although it is not possible in all patients, doing so hastens provision of quality compressions that affect hemodynamic parameters without causing prolongations to the pulse check pause. Further research is needed to determine patient outcomes from both out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is visually guided by focused echocardiography.

AB Mutations in genes encoding components of the DNA damage response (DDR) are among the most frequent aberrations in human tumors. Moreover, a large array of human syndromes is caused by mutations in genes involved in DDR pathways. Among others, homologous recombination repair (HR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is frequently affected by disabling mutations. While impaired HR is clearly promoting tumorigenesis, it is also associated with an actionable sensitivity against PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors have recently received FDA approval for the treatment of breast- and ovarian cancer. However, as with all molecularly targeted agents, acquired resistance limits its use. Both pharmaco-genomic approaches and the study of human genome instability syndromes have led to a profound understanding of PARP inhibitor resistance. These experiments have revealed new insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive mammalian DSB repair. Here, we review recent discoveries in the field and provide a clinical perspective.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide the reader an understanding of the importance and limitations of prostate cancer (PCa) screening, the heritable component of PCa and the role that germline genetic markers can play in risk-adapted screening and treatment.; RECENT FINDINGS: Despite strong science supporting the association of germline genetic change with PCa risk and outcome, there has been a reluctance to pursue practical application of these technologies. Recent findings suggest that actionable information may now be garnered from this form of testing, which can help men at risk for and with PCa.; SUMMARY: This is an exciting time whereby germline genetic markers can help overcome some of the shortcomings of current PCa screening and treatment paradigms. Understanding their benefit and limitations while keeping the patient's best interest in mind will be the key for the responsible application of these exciting technologies.

AB DATA SOURCES: Not applicable.; SUMMARY: Since at least the time of Hippocrates, health care providers have recognized their responsibility to protect patients from potential harm resulting from the care they provide. In pharmacy, such harm typically results from a violation of any of the "5 rights" of safe medication use. However, a memorable adage stops short of providing operational guidance to improve medication safety. Specific actionable recommendations are needed to identify changes that, if implemented, would significantly improve the safety of medication delivery and use.; CONCLUSION: Most threats to medication safety result from weaknesses or failures in one or more of the key system elements identified by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices. Pharmacists should be advocates for implementing targeted recommendations to strengthen their practice systems and improve medication safety. Copyright © 2019 American Pharmacists Association.

AB Adenomyoepitheliomas (AME) of the breast and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas (EMCs) of salivary gland are morphologically similar tumors defined by the presence of a biphasic population of ductal epithelial elements mixed with myoepithelial cells. We sought to explore the molecular profile of AMEs and determine whether they might also share the PLAG1, HMGA2, and HRAS alterations seen in EMCs. Tumor tissue from 19 AMEs was sequenced and analyzed using Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 covering 2800 COSMIC mutations across 50 cancer-related genes. Cases were additionally screened by FISH for PLAG1 and HMGA2 rearrangements. Of 19 AMEs (12 benign; 7 malignant), 2 cases failed the DNA extraction. Of the remaining 17 cases, 14 had at least one nonsynonymous mutation identified. The most common mutations were in PIK3CA (6/17) and AKT1 (5/17), which were mutually exclusive. Two tumors demonstrated mutations in APC, while 1 demonstrated an STK11 mutation. Mutations in ATM, EGFR, FGFR3 or GNAS were identified in 4 cases with concurrent AKT1 mutations. HRAS mutation co-occurring with PIK3CA mutation was noted in 1 case of ER-negative malignant AME. While 2 cases harbored alterations in HMGA2, none was positive for PLAG1 rearrangement. Our findings confirm that breast AMEs are genetically heterogeneous exhibiting recurrent mutually exclusive mutations of PIK3CA and AKT1 in a majority of cases. HRAS mutations co-occur with PIK3CA mutations in ER-negative AMEs and may possibly be linked to clinically aggressive behavior. We identified hotspot mutations in additional genes (APC, STK11, ATM, EGFR, FGFR3, and GNAS). We report the presence of HMGA2 alterations in 2/16 AMEs, supporting their relationship with EMC of salivary glands in at least a subset of cases. PIK3CA, AKT1 and HRAS may serve as potential actionable therapeutic targets in clinically aggressive AMEs.

AB Aberrant cholesterol metabolism is increasingly appreciated to be essential for prostate cancer initiation and progression. Transcript expression of the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol receptor scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) is elevated in primary prostate cancer. Hypothesizing that SR-B1 expression may help facilitate malignant transformation, we document increased SR-B1 protein and transcript expression in prostate cancer relative to normal prostate epithelium that persists in lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastasis. As intratumoral steroid synthesis from the precursor cholesterol can drive androgen receptor (AR) pathway activity in CRPC, we screened androgenic benign and cancer cell lines for sensitivity to SR-B1 antagonism. Benign cells were insensitive to SR-B1 antagonism, and cancer line sensitivity inversely correlated with expression levels of full-length and splice variant AR. In androgen-responsive CRPC cell model C4-2, SR-B1 antagonism suppressed cholesterol uptake, de novo steroidogenesis, and AR activity. SR-B1 antagonism also suppressed growth and viability and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy. The inability of exogenous steroids to reverse these effects indicates that AR pathway activation is insufficient to overcome cytotoxic stress caused by a decrease in the availability of cholesterol. Furthermore, SR-B1 antagonism decreased cholesterol uptake, growth, and viability of the AR-null CRPC cell model PC-3, and the small-molecule SR-B1 antagonist block lipid transport-1 decreased xenograft growth rate despite poor pharmacologic properties. Overall, our findings show that SR-B1 is upregulated in primary and castration-resistant disease and is essential for cholesterol uptake needed to drive both steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic biogenic pathways, thus implicating SR-B1 as a novel and potentially actionable target in CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight SR-B1 as a potential target in primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer that is essential for cholesterol uptake needed to drive steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic biogenic pathways. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB The health care delivery system is complex. New technologies offer new treatment options. The process of quality improvement includes system re-engineering. Telemedicine intensive care is an evolving area of delivery. Its core characteristic is the need for a merger of human and machine activity. Optimal use of quality improvement tools can lead to improved patient-centered outcomes. This article outlines how quality improvement tools can be used to facilitate the patient-centered collaboration with a focus on defining evidence-practice gaps, developing actionable metrics, analyzing the impact of proposed interventions, quantifying resources, prioritizing improvement plans, evaluating results, and diffusing best practices.

AB Chromosomal rearrangements involving the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes (NTRK genes), which encode the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TRKA), brain-derived neurotrophic factor/neurotrophin-3 (BDNF/NT-3) growth factor receptor (TRKB), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) growth factor receptor (TRKC) tyrosine kinases (TRK proteins), act as oncogenic drivers in a broad range of pediatric and adult tumor types. NTRK gene fusions have been shown to be actionable genomic events that are predictive of response to TRK kinase inhibitors, making their routine detection an evolving clinical priority. In certain exceedingly rare tumor types, NTRK gene fusions may be seen in the overwhelming majority of cases, whereas in a range of common cancers, reported incidences are in the range of 0.1% to 2%. Herein, we review the structure of the three NTRK genes and the nature and incidence of NTRK gene fusions in different solid tumor types, and we summarize the clinical data showing the importance of identifying tumors harboring such genomic events. We also outline the laboratory techniques that can be used to diagnose NTRK gene fusions in clinical samples. Finally, we propose a diagnostic algorithm for solid tumors to facilitate the identification of patients with TRK fusion cancer. This algorithm accounts for the widely varying frequencies by tumor histology and the underlying prevalence of TRK expression in the absence of NTRK gene fusions and is based on a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization, next-generation sequencing, and immunohistochemistry assays.

AB INTRODUCTION: This study explored pregnant women's experiences in accessing, understanding, evaluating, communicating, and using health information and services during pregnancy.; METHODS: Pregnant participants (aged 18-45 years) were recruited from an obstetrics and gynecology department of a large urban training hospital. Focus groups were facilitated by a moderator's guide developed from health literacy domains (access, understand, evaluate, and communicate and use), audio recorded, transcribed, and uploaded into ATLAS.ti. Constant comparative and thematic analysis were employed.; RESULTS: Participants (N = 17) were predominantly Hispanic (53%), married (67%), college educated (87%), employed (80%), insured (100%), and nulliparous (59%). Health care providers and online and digital sources were preferred sources of information. Participants' understanding was facilitated by plain language, pictures and other visuals, numbers and statistics, and tailored information. Participants evaluated information credibility by source (health care provider, advertisement, multiple sources) and personal circumstances (eg, health history, gestational age). In addition, these women used the information to communicate with health care providers, family, and partners and to change health-related behaviors.; DISCUSSION: Participants described rich, contextual health literacy experiences. Future interventions that maximize access to health care providers and online and digital sources, while ensuring materials are easy to understand, convenient, and patient centered, could facilitate informed decision making during this critical period. Future prenatal education and counseling interventions could be developed and evaluated using established health literacy principles to ensure that information is accessible, understandable, and actionable. © 2019 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB OBJECTIVE: The statin family of cholesterol-lowering drugs has been shown to induce tumor-specific apoptosis by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Accumulating evidence suggests that statin use may delay prostate cancer (PCa) progression in a subset of patients; however, the determinants of statin drug sensitivity in PCa remain unclear. Our goal was to identify molecular features of statin-sensitive PCa and opportunities to potentiate statin-induced PCa cell death.; METHODS: Deregulation of HMGCR expression in PCa was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The response of PCa cell lines to fluvastatin-mediated HMGCR inhibition was assessed using cell viability and apoptosis assays. Activation of the sterol-regulated feedback loop of the MVA pathway, which was hypothesized to modulate statin sensitivity in PCa, was also evaluated. Inhibition of this statin-induced feedback loop was performed using RNA interference or small molecule inhibitors. The achievable levels of fluvastatin in mouse prostate tissue were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.; RESULTS: High HMGCR expression in PCa was associated with poor prognosis; however, not all PCa cell lines underwent apoptosis in response to treatment with physiologically-achievable concentrations of fluvastatin. Rather, most cell lines initiated a feedback response mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), which led to the further upregulation of HMGCR and other lipid metabolism genes. Overcoming this feedback mechanism by knocking down or inhibiting SREBP2 potentiated fluvastatin-induced PCa cell death. Notably, we demonstrated that this feedback loop is pharmacologically-actionable, as the drug dipyridamole can be used to block fluvastatin-induced SREBP activation and augment apoptosis in statin-insensitive PCa cells.; CONCLUSION: Our study implicates statin-induced SREBP2 activation as a PCa vulnerability that can be exploited for therapeutic purposes using clinically-approved agents.

AB BACKGROUND: Based on the findings of a prior study of CIED (Cardiac Implantable Electrical Device) remote monitoring (RM) frequency at the same center, the University of Michigan Congenital Heart Center (UMCHC) instituted a quality improvement (QI) change to reduce the frequency of routine CIED RM from every 2 months to every 3 months. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of this QI initiative to reduce workload without compromising patient care.; METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of all UMCHC patients with CIEDs followed via Medtronic CareLink CIED remote monitoring system from July 2015 to June 2017, after the QI change in 2014. The primary outcome was success of transition to new monitoring schedule. Secondary outcomes included complications, incidence of actionable events (AES), patient compliance, and change in workload. Outcomes were compared to the prior study.; RESULTS: There were 325 patients (mean age was 24 ± 14 years) included, of who 293 (90%) completely transitioned to the new RM schedule. During the study period, 96 transmissions included AES (4% of total), of which 50 (52%) were asymptomatic and discovered on routine monitoring. No patient experienced a complication attributable to decreased RM frequency. The mean number of interrogations decreased by 1.6 per patient over the 2-year period compared to prior study.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated successful implementation of a QI initiative to reduce CIED monitoring frequency at a single center with no patient adverse events. The intervention reduced workload and potentially improved patient compliance with routine RM. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB INTRODUCTION: Patients with pulmonary large-cell carcinoma (LCC) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The identification of clinically actionable molecular alterations helps to guide personalized cancer treatment decisions.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 789 resected NSCLC cases were reviewed. Fifty-nine NSCLC cases lacking morphologic differentiation, accounting for 7.5% of all resected NSCLCs, were identified and further characterized by immunohistochemistry according to the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification. Molecular alterations were investigated by multiple technologies including target capture sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridizations.; RESULTS: Of 59 NSCLC cases lacking morphologic differentiation, 20 (33.9%) were reclassified as adenocarcinoma (LCC-AD), 14 (23.7%) as squamous cell carcinoma (LCC-SqCC), and 25 (42.4%) as LCC-Null. Approximately 92% of LCC-Null, 95% of LCC-AD, and 86% of LCC-SqCC harbored clinically relevant alterations. Alterations characteristic ofadenocarcinoma (EGFR, KRAS, ALK receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK], ROS1, and serine/threonine kinase 11 [STK11]) were detected in the LCC-AD subgroup but not in LCC-SqCC, whereas squamous-lineage alterations (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA], SRY-box 2 [SOX2], fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 [FGFR1], and AKT1) were detected in the LCC-SqCC subgroup but not in the LCC-AD group. Although some LCC-Null tumors displayed a genetic profile similar to either adenocarcinoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, more than half of the LCC-Null group were completely devoid of recognizable lineage-specific genetic profiles. High programmed death ligand 1 expression and high frequency of cell cycle regulatory gene alterations were found in the LCC-Null group offering alternative options of targeted therapy.; CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive molecular study provided further insight into the genetic architecture of LCC. The presence of clinically actionable alterations in a majority of the tumors allowed personalized treatment to emerge. Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

AB The October 2018 report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts significant threats to human health secondary to anthropogenic global warming; children have been and will continue to be disproportionately affected by these weather-related changes. Multiple physician groups have acknowledged climate change as a public health issue, calling upon providers to educate their communities about this looming health crisis while also reducing their individual carbon footprints. A significant body of literature has also documented the adverse dermatologic consequences of a warmer planet, highlighting the importance of pediatric dermatologists in addressing climate change. Here, we summarize the rationale for the pediatric dermatologist as public health advocate, providing specific actionable items through which our specialty can positively address the climate change crisis and in turn protect the health of our patients now and in the future. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Public reporting of provider performance currently encompasses a range of measures of quality, cost, and patient experience of care. However, little is known about how medical groups use measures for performance improvement. This information could help medical groups undertake internal measurement while helping payers, policy makers, and measurement experts develop more useful publicly reported measures and quality improvement strategies.; METHODS: An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted of ambulatory care medical groups across the United States that currently gather their own performance data.; RESULTS: Eighty-three interviews were conducted with 91 individuals representing 37 medical groups. Findings were distilled into three major themes: (1) measures used internally, (2) strategies for using internal measurement for performance improvement, and (3) other uses of internal measurement. Medical groups used both clinical and business process measures, including measures from external measure sets and internally derived measures. Strategies for using internal measurement for quality improvement included taking a gradual, iterative approach and setting clear goals with high priority, finding workable approaches to data sharing, and fostering engagement by focusing on actionable measures. Measurement was also used to check accuracy of external performance reports, clarify and manage conflicting external measurement requirements, and prepare for anticipated external measurement requirements. Respondents in most groups did not report a need to assess costs of internal measurement or the capacity to do so.; CONCLUSION: Despite challenges and barriers, respondents found great value in conducting internal measurement. Their experiences may provide valuable lessons and knowledge for medical group leaders in earlier stages of establishing internal measurement programs. Copyright © 2019 The Joint Commission.

AB Scientists are expected to communicate their research to a wide audience, while often lacking appreciable training. Environmental science poses many value-laden and ethical questions. This necessitates the identification and use of specific strategies or guidelines, which encourage 2-way communication and enable trust in both the experts and the scientific results. The objective of this paper is to give environmental scientists tools for effective science communication based on sound scientific evidence that does not require further specialization in communication studies. Using common scientific search engines in Europe, scientific communication literature that met specific parameters was identified. The summarized data contextualize the importance of science communication in environmental sciences but also highlight the need of scientists for communication experts to aid in establishing objectives for particularly complex topics and audiences.

AB BACKGROUND: Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent the most common malignancy in young men. While GCTs represent a model for curable solid tumors due to exquisite chemosensitivity, mortality for patients with GCT comprises the most life years lost for non-pediatric malignancies. Given limited options for patients with platinum-resistant disease, improved insight into GCT biology could identify novel therapeutic options for patients with platinum-resistant disease. Recent studies into molecular characteristics of both early stage and advanced germ cell tumors suggest a role for rationally targeted agents and potentially immunotherapy.; RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Recent GWAS meta-analyses have uncovered additional susceptibility loci for GCT and provide further evidence that GCT risk is polygenic. Chromosome arm level amplifications and reciprocal loss of heterozygosity have been described as significantly enriched in GCT compared to other cancer types. Contemporary analyses confirm ubiquitous gain of isochromosome 12 and mutations in addition to previously described GCT-associated genes such as KIT and KRAS. Alterations within the TP53-MDM2 signal transduction pathway appear to be enriched among patients with platinum-resistant disease. Potentially actionable targets, including alterations in TP53-MDM2, Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K, and MAPK signaling, are present in significant proportions of patients with platinum-resistant disease and may be exploited as therapeutic options. Pre-clinical and early clinical data also suggest a potential role for immunotherapy among patients with GCTs.; CONCLUSION: Molecular characterization of GCT patients may provide biologic rationale for novel treatment options in patients with platinum-resistant disease. © 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.

AB In this article, the authors propose a vision for exemplary learning environments in which everyone involved in health professions education and health care collaborates toward optimal health for individuals, populations, and communities. Learning environments in the health professions can be conceptualized as complex adaptive systems, defined as a collection of individual agents whose actions are interconnected and follow a set of shared "simple rules." Using principles from complex adaptive systems as a guiding framework for the proposed vision, the authors postulate that exemplary learning environments will follow four such simple rules: Health care and health professions education share a goal of improving health for individuals, populations, and communities; in exemplary learning environments, learning is work and work is learning; exemplary learning environments recognize that collaboration with integration of diverse perspectives is essential for success; and the organizations and agents in the learning environments learn about themselves and the greater system they are part of in order to achieve continuous improvement and innovation. For each of the simple rules, the authors describe the details of the vision and how the current state diverges from this vision. They provide actionable ideas about how to reach the vision using specific examples from the literature. In addition, they identify potential targets for assessment to monitor the success of learning environments, including outcome measures at the individual, team, institutional, and societal levels. Such measurements can ensure optimal alignment between health professions education and health care and inform ongoing improvement of learning environments.

AB OBJECTIVES: Patient Health Priorities Identification (PHPI) is a values-based process in which trained facilitators assist older adults with multiple chronic conditions identify their health priorities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients' perceptions of PHPI.; DESIGN: Qualitative study using thematic analysis.; SETTING: In-depth semistructured telephone and in-person interviews.; PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two older adults who participated in the PHPI process.; MEASUREMENTS: Open-ended questions about patient perceptions of the PHPI process, perceived benefits of the process, enablers and barriers to PHPI, and recommendations for process enhancement.; RESULTS: Patient interviews ranged from 9 to 63minutes (median=20min; interquartile range =15-26). The mean age was 80 years (standard deviation= 7.96), 64% were female, and all patients identified themselves as white. Of the sample, 73% reported no caregiver involvement in their healthcare; 36% lived alone. Most patients felt able to complete the PHPI process with ease. Perceived benefits included increased knowledge and insight into disease processes and treatment options, patient activation, and enhanced communication with family and clinicians. Patients identified several factors that were both enablers and barriers to PHPI including facilitator characteristics, patient demographic and clinical characteristics, social support, relationships between the patient and their primary care provider, and the changing health priorities of the patient. Recommendations for process enhancement included more frequent and flexible facilitator contacts, selection of patients for participation based on specific patient characteristics, clarification of process aims and expectations, involvement of family, written reminders of established health priorities, short duration between facilitation and primary care provider follow-up, and the inclusion of health-related tasks in facilitation visits.; CONCLUSIONS: Patients found the PHPI process valuable in identifying actionable health priorities and healthcare goals leading to enhanced knowledge, activation, and communication regarding their treatment options and preferences. PHPI may be useful for aligning the healthcare that patients receive with their values-based priorities. © 2019 The American Geriatrics Society.

AB BACKGROUND: Enrichment of patients based on molecular biomarkers is increasingly used in early phase clinical trials. Molecular profiling of patients with advanced cancers can identify specific genomic alterations to inform decisions about investigational treatment(s). Our aim was to evaluate the outcomes of new patient referrals to a large academic solid tumor phase I clinical trial program after the implementation of molecular profiling.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all new referrals to the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) phase I clinic from May 2012 to December 2014. Molecular profiling using either MALDI-TOF hotspot mutation genotyping or targeted panel DNA sequencing was performed for patients at PM or community hospitals through the institutional IMPACT/COMPACT trials.; RESULTS: A total of 971 new patient referrals were included for this analysis. Twenty-seven percent of referrals assessed in clinic were subsequently enrolled in phase I trials. Of all new referrals, 41% had prior molecular profiling, of whom 11% (n=42) were enrolled in genotype-matched trials. Patients with prior molecular profiling were younger, more heavily pretreated, and had more favorable Princess Margaret Hospital Index (PMHI) scores. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 (p=.002), internal referrals within PM (p=.002), and PMHI (p≤.001) were independently associated with successful trial enrollment in multivariable analysis.; CONCLUSION: Although nearly half of new patients referred to a phase I clinic had prior molecular profiling, the proportion subsequently enrolled into clinical trials was low. Prior molecular profiling was not an independent predictor of clinical trial enrollment.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The landscape of oncology drug development is evolving alongside technological advancements. Recently, large academic medical centers have implemented clinical sequencing protocols to identify patients with actionable genomic alterations to enroll in therapeutic clinical trials. This study evaluates patient referral and enrollment patterns in a large academic phase I clinical trials program following the implementation of a molecular profiling program. Performance status and referral from a physician within the institution were associated with successful trial enrollment, whereas prior molecular profiling was not an independent predictor. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB In non-acute promyelotic leukemia (APL)- non myelocytic leukemia (AML), identification of a signaling signature would predict potentially actionable targets to enhance differentiation effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and make combination differentiation therapy realizable. Components of such a signaling machine/signalsome found to drive RA-induced differentiation discerned in a FAB M2 cell line/model (HL-60) were further characterized and then compared against AML patient expression profiles. FICZ, known to enhance RA-induced differentiation, was used to experimentally augment signaling for analysis. FRET revealed novel signalsome protein associations: CD38 with pS376SLP76 and caveolin-1 with CD38 and AhR. The signaling molecules driving differentiation in HL-60 cluster in non-APL AML de novo samples, too. Pearson correlation coefficients for this molecular ensemble are nearer 1 in the FAB M2 subtype than in non-APL AML. SLP76 correlation to RXRalpha and p47phox were conserved in FAB M2 model and patient subtype but not in general non-APL AML. The signalsome ergo identifies potential actionable targets in AML.

AB Biomedical big data amasses from different sources such as electronic health records, health research, wearable devices and social media. Recent advances in data capturing, storage and analysis techniques have facilitated conversion of a wealth of knowledge in biomedical big data into evidence-based actionable plans to enhance population health and well-being. The delay in reaping the benefits of biomedical big data in dentistry is mainly due to the slow adoption of electronic health record systems, unstructured clinical records, tattered communication between data silos and perceiving oral health as a separate entity from general health. Recent recognition of the complex interplay between oral and general health has acknowledged the power of oral health big data to glean new insights on disease prevention and management. This review paper summarizes recent advances, limitations and challenges in biomedical big data in health care with emphasis on oral health and discusses the potential future applications of oral health big data to improve the quality and efficiency of personalized health care. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB PURPOSE: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors face long-term, elevated risk of treatment-related sequelae, including psychosocial distress associated with poor health outcomes. The magnitude and sources of distress are not well described in the routine care of HL outside of clinical trials.; METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients visiting a tertiary-care center for treatment or long-term follow-up of HL. Patient-reported distress was documented using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (DT) and Problem List. Three survivor groups were compared using descriptive methods: on treatment, surviving <5years, and surviving ≥5years since diagnosis.; RESULTS: A total of 1524 DT were abstracted for 304 patients (106 on treatment, 77 surviving <5years, and 121 surviving ≥5years). Distress was low overall (median DT=1, inter-quartile range 0-4) and was similar across survivor groups. However, actionable distress (score≥4) was reported at 29.5% of clinical encounters. Patients on treatment more frequently reported actionable distress (32.5% of visits) compared with patients surviving <5years (20.4%) and ≥5years (28.7%) (P=0.065). Distress was associated primarily with physical and emotional problems, especially fatigue, worry, and sleep. We did not observe any associations between distress and clinical prognostic factors.; CONCLUSIONS: Distress burden is low in HL, but survivorship is marked by periods of actionable distress, largely related to physical symptoms and emotional issues. This burden may be higher when on treatment and is unrelated to disease-related prognostic factors. Survivorship research typically focuses on the post-therapy period, but our results support testing the efficacy of interventions to address distress in HL during active treatment as well.

AB Mutational characterisation utilising plasma (PL)-derived circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in multiple myeloma (MM) has been recently described. Mutational analyses of paired bone marrow (BM) MM cell DNA and ctDNA from 76 patients (n = 24, new diagnosis (ND), n = 52, relapsed/refractory (RR)) for (ras/raf signaling pathway) and tumour protein p53 (TP53) mutations using the OnTarget Mutation Detection (OMD) platform was performed. The total number and proportions of mutations in each of the compartments (BM-specific, PL-specific or shared) was significantly higher in RR patients compared to ND patients (p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Patients with > 2 mutations or > 1% fractional abundance (FA) in the PL had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (p = 0.04 and p = 0.0006, respectively). Patients with PL-specific TP53 mutations had significantly shorter OS compared to patients with no PL-TP53 mutations (p = 0.003), while no differences were observed in patients with (K-ras) KRAS mutations. Targeted deep amplicon sequencing (TAS) of matched PL and BM samples from 36 MM patients for DNA-repair and RAS-RAF pathway genes found that DNA-repair genes were present at significantly higher levels in the PL when compared to RAS-RAF mutations (p = 0.0095). We conclude that ctDNA analysis identifies a higher prevalence of potentially actionable DNA-repair gene mutated subclones than BM analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease with multiple triggers. It can be managed by strict adherence to an asthma care plan and by avoiding these triggers. Clinicians cannot continuously monitor their patients' environment and their adherence to an asthma care plan, which poses a significant challenge for asthma management.; OBJECTIVE: In this study, pediatric patients were continuously monitored using low-cost sensors to collect asthma-relevant information. The objective of this study was to assess whether kHealth kit, which contains low-cost sensors, can identify personalized triggers and provide actionable insights to clinicians for the development of a tailored asthma care plan.; METHODS: The kHealth asthma kit was developed to continuously track the symptoms of asthma in pediatric patients and monitor the patients' environment and adherence to their care plan for either 1 or 3 months. The kit consists of an Android app-based questionnaire to collect information on asthma symptoms and medication intake, Fitbit to track sleep and activity, the Peak Flow meter to monitor lung functions, and Foobot to monitor indoor air quality. The data on the patient's outdoor environment were collected using third-party Web services based on the patient's zip code. To date, 107 patients consented to participate in the study and were recruited from the Dayton Children's Hospital, of which 83 patients completed the study as instructed.; RESULTS: Patient-generated health data from the 83 patients who completed the study were included in the cohort-level analysis. Of the 19% (16/83) of patients deployed in spring, the symptoms of 63% (10/16) and 19% (3/16) of patients suggested pollen and particulate matter (PM2.5), respectively, to be their major asthma triggers. Of the 17% (14/83) of patients deployed in fall, symptoms of 29% (4/17) and 21% (3/17) of patients suggested pollen and PM2.5, respectively, to be their major triggers. Among the 28% (23/83) of patients deployed in winter, PM2.5 was identified as the major trigger for 83% (19/23) of patients. Similar correlations were not observed between asthma symptoms and factors such as ozone level, temperature, and humidity. Furthermore, 1 patient from each season was chosen to explain, in detail, his or her personalized triggers by observing temporal associations between triggers and asthma symptoms gathered using the kHealth asthma kit.; CONCLUSIONS: The continuous monitoring of pediatric asthma patients using the kHealth asthma kit generates insights on the relationship between their asthma symptoms and triggers across different seasons. This can ultimately inform personalized asthma management and intervention plans. ©Revathy Venkataramanan, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Utkarshani Jaimini, Dipesh Kadariya, Hong Yung Yip, Maninder Kalra, Amit Sheth.

AB BACKGROUND: With the exception of trastuzumab, therapies directed at receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEA) have had limited success. Recurrent fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) alterations exist in GEA; however, little is known about the genomic landscape of FGFR2-altered GEA. We examined FGFR2 alteration frequency and frequency of co-occurring alterations in GEA.; SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: A total of 6,667 tissue specimens from patients with advanced GEA were assayed using hybrid capture-based genomic profiling. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA, and microsatellite instability was determined on 95 or 114 loci. Descriptive statistics were used to compare subgroups.; RESULTS: We identified a total of 269 (4.0%) FGFR2-altered cases consisting of FGFR2-amplified (amp; 193, 72% of FGFR2-altered), FGFR2-mutated (36, 13%), FGFR2-rearranged (re; 23, 8.6%), and cases with multiple FGFR2 alterations (17, 6.3%). Co-occurring alterations in other GEA RTK targets including ERBB2 (10%), EGFR (8%), and MET (3%) were observed across all classes of FGFR2-altered GEA. Co-occurring alterations in MYC (17%), KRAS (10%), and PIK3CA (5.6%) were also observed frequently. Cases with FGFR2amp and FGFR2re were exclusively microsatellite stable. The median TMB for FGFR2-altered GEA was 3.6 mut/mb, not significantly different from a median of 4.3 mut/mb seen in FGFR2 wild-type samples.; CONCLUSION: FGFR2-altered GEA is a heterogenous subgroup with approximately 20% of FGFR2-altered samples harboring concurrent RTK alterations. Putative co-occurring modifiers of FGFR2-directed therapy including oncogenic MYC, KRAS, and PIK3CA alterations were also frequent, suggesting that pretreatment molecular analyses may be needed to facilitate rational combination therapies and optimize patient selection for clinical trials.; IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Actionable receptor tyrosine kinase alterations assayed within a genomic context with therapeutic implications remain limited to HER2 amplification in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEA). Composite biomarkers and heterogeneity assessment are critical in optimizing patients selected for targeted therapies in GEA. Comprehensive genomic profiling in FGFR2-altered GEA parallels the heterogeneity findings in HER2-amplified GEA and adds support to the utility of genomic profiling in advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas. © AlphaMed Press 2019.

AB BACKGROUND: Thrombectomy is an efficacious treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, relatively few studies to date have specifically examined the impact and clinical implications of age on outcomes for thrombectomy in anterior AIS.; OBJECTIVE: To provide a snapshot of patient metrics and outcomes with respect to age following thrombectomy for anterior AIS to supplement the current body of data for predictors of clinical outcomes in a real-world setting.; METHODS: Data were collected for 20 consecutive patients with AIS treated with thrombectomy at 15 high-volume stroke centers across North America between 2015 and 2016. Patients with anterior occlusions were dichotomized based on whether they were older or younger than 80 years. Ordinal logistic regression analyzed how clinical variables impacted disability using 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores.; RESULTS: Adequate revascularization (TICI ≥2B) was achieved in 92.3% of patients aged <80 years with an average 1.7±0.1 passes taken with the primary technique and in 88.0% of patients aged ≥80 years with an average 1.7±0.2 passes. Despite similar baseline characteristics, mRS scores were significantly higher in older patients postoperatively and at 90 days after intervention. Age was a significant predictor of 90-day mRS across the study population.; CONCLUSION: This analysis affirms age is a significant determinant of 90-day mRS scores following thrombectomy for large vessel anterior AIS. Further investigation into risks faced by elderly patients during thrombectomy may provide actionable information to help refine patient selection and improve outcomes. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB AIM: To define and quantify hospital-acquired malnutrition, including the concept of preventable and non-preventable malnutrition; and identify the main causes of preventable malnutrition. Furthermore, demonstrate potential cost-savings for a quaternary hospital in Sydney (Australia) if a theoretical model of preventable malnutrition was applied to the penalties associated with hospital-acquired malnutrition, compared to the current government framework.; METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted on electronic medical records reassessing cases of hospital-acquired malnutrition previously identified by dietitians or medical coders. Costs were calculated using the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's (IHPA) pricing principles for hospital-acquired complications (version 3, 2018).; RESULTS: Twenty-three patients of 15419 admissions were identified with hospital-acquired malnutrition in the 3-month study period. Sixteen cases (70%) were classified as preventable, two cases (9%) were classified as non-preventable, and five cases were non-hospital-acquired cases of malnutrition. Under the IHPA proposed costing model, total cost of all hospital-acquired malnutrition to the hospital is estimated to be $162600 over 3 months. The theoretical model of preventable malnutrition resulted in a cost penalty of only $98600, which is a hospital cost-saving of $64000 (or 40% of the overall penalty) when compared to the current government framework.; CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospital-acquired malnutrition cases were found to have a preventable component. It is proposed that a costing model that penalises hospitals for only preventable hospital-acquired malnutrition be considered, which would permit hospitals to focus on addressing preventable (and thus actionable) causes of hospital-acquired malnutrition with not only potential health benefits to patients but cost-savings to hospitals. © 2019 Dietitians Association of Australia.

AB Global Mental Health has developed interventions that strive to work across great difference-variously conceptualized as cultural, socio-economic, geographic, or pertaining to the characteristics of health systems. This article discusses how the evaluation framework Theory of Change (ToC) facilitates the production of 'global' knowledge across such differences. Drawing on 14months of multi-sited fieldwork among Global Mental Health actors in Europe, North America and South Africa, it traces the differential use of ToC in GMH interventions. While much critical scholarship of Global Health metrics holds that techniques of quantification rely on universals that necessarily betray the "real world", ToC unsettles these critiques. It comes into view as an epistemic and relational device that produces 'contingent universals'-concepts that are true and measurable until they stop working in the field, or until the parameters of 'what works' shift to a new iteration. As such, Theory of Change produces actionable-rather than true-knowledge attuned to open-ended change, both desirable (impact) and unforeseen (adaptation). Its effects, however, are ambiguous. ToC presents us with a horizoning technique that enables what I call "virtuous failure" within the evidence-based paradigm. It may equally harbor the potential to disrupt distinctions such as bricolage (tinkering) and design (planning) and their respective politics, as it may tie neatly into audit cultures, depending on its use. The article analyzes the novel stakes of reflexive evaluation techniques and calls on anthropology and critical Global Health for renewed empirical engagement.

AB Chemoresistance is a major cause of recurrence and death from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), both in adult and pediatric patients. In the majority of cases, drug-resistant disease is treated by selecting a combination of other drugs, without understanding the molecular mechanisms by which malignant cells escape chemotherapeutic treatments, even though a more detailed genomic characterization and the identification of actionable disease targets may enable informed decision of new agents to improve patient outcomes. In this work, we describe pathways of resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents including glucocorticoids and review the resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy such as IL7R, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, NOTCH1, BRD4/MYC, Cyclin D3: CDK4/CDK6, BCL2 inhibitors, and selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). Finally, to overcome the limitations of the current trial-and-error method, we summarize the experiences of anti-cancer drug sensitivity resistance profiling (DSRP) approaches as a rapid and relevant strategy to infer drug activity and provide functional information to assist clinical decision one patient at a time.

AB Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of lung cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%-19%, and more than 80% of the patients with lung cancer have progressed to advanced stage (Stage IIIb-IV) when they are clearly diagnosed. The comprehensive treatment mainly based on chemotherapy as the primary form is now considered as the major therapy method for advanced NSCLC without actionable driver gene mutations. Pemetrexed plus platinum doublet as well as single-agent pemetrexed are respectively the first-line major regimens recommended by guidelines and the second-line optional regimens. Yet the third-line treatment or beyond in advanced NSCLC is not evidence-based but conducted based on patients' previous medications, which is one of the most commonly used clinical methods. As pemetrexed is a multi-target chemotherapy drug with high efficiency but low toxicity, pemetrexed re-challenge strategy in advanced NSCLC is also a reasonable choice. We report one effective individual case that adopted pemetrexed re-challenge strategy in advanced NSCLC for three times, and at the same time conduct the relevant literature review.

AB The complexity of human cancer underlies its devastating clinical consequences. Drugs designed to target the genetic alterations that drive cancer have improved the outcome for many patients, but not the majority of them. Here, we review the genomic landscape of cancer, how genomic data can provide much more than a sum of its parts, and the approaches developed to identify and validate genomic alterations with potential therapeutic value. We highlight notable successes and pitfalls in predicting the value of potential therapeutic targets and discuss the use of multi-omic data to better understand cancer dependencies and drug sensitivity. We discuss how integrated approaches to collecting, curating, and sharing these large data sets might improve the identification and prioritization of cancer vulnerabilities as well as patient stratification within clinical trials. Finally, we outline how future approaches might improve the efficiency and speed of translating genomic data into clinically effective therapies and how the use of unbiased genome-wide information can identify novel predictive biomarkers that can be either simple or complex.

AB ABSTRACTObjective:The Society of Academic Emergency Medicine Disaster Medicine Interest Group, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response - Technical Resources, Assistance Center, and Information Exchange (ASPR TRACIE) team, and the National Institutes of Health Library searched disaster medicine peer-reviewed and gray literature to identify, review, and disseminate the most important new research in this field for academics and practitioners.; METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched with key words. Additional gray literature and focused hand search were performed. A Level I review of titles and abstracts with inclusion criteria of disaster medicine, health care system, and disaster type concepts was performed. Eight reviewers performed Level II full-text review and formal scoring for overall quality, impact, clarity, and importance, with scoring ranging from 0 to 20. Reviewers summarized and critiqued articles scoring 16.5 and above.; RESULTS: Articles totaling 1176 were identified, and 347 were screened in a Level II review. Of these, 193 (56%) were Original Research, 117 (34%) Case Report or other, and 37 (11%) were Review/Meta-Analysis. The average final score after a Level II review was 11.34. Eighteen articles scored 16.5 or higher. Of the 18 articles, 9 (50%) were Case Report or other, 7 (39%) were Original Research, and 2 (11%) were Review/Meta-Analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: This first review highlighted the breadth of disaster medicine, including emerging infectious disease outbreaks, terror attacks, and natural disasters. We hope this review becomes an annual source of actionable, pertinent literature for the emerging field of disaster medicine.

AB Several large epidemiological studies have found robust associations between greenness and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These studies report that close residential proximity to greenness is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality as well as major adverse cardiovascular events. Although mechanisms underlying this link are not well understood, the beneficial health effects of greenness have been linked to its ability to relieve stress, decrease air pollution, and encourage physical activity. Greenness in residential neighborhoods could also increase access to healthy goods and services, as well as social interactions. Research into the health effects of greenness could provide new insights into the environmental determinants of CVD risk and could inform the development of actionable greenness-based strategies to prevent CVD and its clinical manifestations.

AB BACKGROUND: Contextual research evidence is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality due to chronic but preventable diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is particularly burdened by these diseases despite its academic and research infrastructure. A major impediment to developing robust evidence on sustainable disease prevention and treatment strategies is the lack of skilled research personnel.; OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify (1) training barriers for research assistants and coordinators and (2) potential strategies to counter these barriers using a Nominal Group Technique (NGT) exercise conductedat the 2017 conference of the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA).; METHOD: A one-hour NGT exercise was conducted with 26 groups of 2-9 persons each (N = 134) drawn from conference attendees. Group members were presented with questions related to the two objectives. Each member was asked to generate, list, discuss and vote on ideas that were eventually ranked by the group. Qualitative Thematic Analysis (QTA) was conducted for the collated responses.; FINDINGS: The QTA identified 166 training gaps and 147 potential solutions, out of which 104 were ranked. Themes that emerged for gaps included: 1) inadequate mentorship; 2) inadequate training/ lack of organized curriculum; 3) limited access to opportunities for training and employment; 4) lack of governmentfunding; 5) lack of interest, motivation; and6) lack of research culture. Themes for potential strategiesto address the gaps were: 1) trainings/curriculum development; 2) research modules implemented in secondary and tertiary institutions; 3) creating a sustainable forum for research-related questions and answers; and 4) advocating for and accessing more government fundingfor research training.; CONCLUSION: This study identified actionable strategies that reflect practical realities in implementation research in Nigeria, which can guide government agencies, policy makers, research organizations, and local foundations as they work together to increase research capacity in Nigeria. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB Among Uveal Melanoma (UM) driver mutations, those involving GNAQ or GNA11 genes are the most frequent, while a minor fraction of tumors bears mutations in the PLCB4 or CYSLTR2 genes. Direct inhibition of constitutively active oncoproteins deriving from these mutations is still in its infancy in UM, whereas BRAFV600E-targeted therapy has obtained relevant results in cutaneous melanoma. However, UM driver mutations converge on common downstream signaling pathways such as PKC/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and YAP/TAZ, which are presently considered as actionable targets. In addition, BAP1 loss, which characterizes UM metastatic progression, affects chromatin structure via histone H2A deubiquitylation that may be counteracted by histone deacetylase inhibitors. Encouraging results of preclinical studies targeting signaling molecules such as MAPK and PKC were unfortunately not confirmed in early clinical studies. Indeed, a general survey of all clinical trials applying new targeted and immune therapy to UM displayed disappointing results. This paper summarizes the most recent studies of UM-targeted therapies, analyzing the possible origins of failures. We also focus on hyperexpressed molecules involved in UM aggressiveness as potential new targets for therapy.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether collegiate athletes and nonathlete college students differ in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and help-seeking behaviors. Participants: 165,210 respondents to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment (NCHA), a survey administered to college students by participating institutions during Fall 2011 to Spring 2015. Methods: Single-level binary logistic regression with equality of coefficients tests and chi-square analyses. Results: The models for NSSI and suicide attempt differed slightly between student-athletes and nonathletes. Most notably, stress is a stronger correlate of NSSI (Z=3.03, p<.01) for nonathletes while difficulties with social relationships is a stronger correlate of suicide attempt for student-athletes (Z=-3.13, p<.01). Conclusion: Our findings highlight the salience of relationship problems as a correlate with suicide attempts in student-athletes. Difficulty in romantic or other social relationships could be a marker of risk or an identifiable, actionable target for preventing future suicidal behaviors among collegiate athletes.

AB BACKGROUND: The high operational cost of MRI limits its utility for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening. Abbreviated-protocol dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (aMRI) may help lower cost while maintaining the high accuracy of complete-protocol diagnostic MRI (cMRI).; PURPOSE: To compare aMRI to cMRI for HCC detection in cirrhosis patients.; STUDY TYPE: Cross-sectional study.; STUDY POPULATION: Cirrhosis patients undergoing MRI for suspected HCC.; FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T and 3T; aMRI (coronal T2 -weighted, axial dynamic contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted fat-suppressed sequences); cMRI (aMRI sequences and unenhanced axial T2 -, T1 -, and diffusion-weighted sequences).; ASSESSMENT: From each cMRI, an abbreviated exam was created by extracting only the aMRI sequences. Five radiologists independently reviewed aMRI and cMRI and assigned per-patient screening results by the presence/absence of any actionable observation per Liver Imaging and Reporting Data System v2018 (LI-RADS 4, 5, M, or TIV categories). Per-patient HCC status was determined by the composite reference standard of histopathology, follow-up imaging, consensus expert panel imaging review, and clinical follow-up.; STATISTICAL TESTS: Interreader agreement between aMRI and cMRI was compared with that of cMRI and tested for interchangeability against a tolerance margin of 0.05. Per-patient screening sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared between aMRI and cMRI and tested for equivalence against a tolerance margin of 0.05.; RESULTS: In 93 cirrhosis patients, five radiologists recorded on average 121 liver observations. Interreader screening agreement probability (and 95% confidence interval confidence interval [CI]) was 0.914 [0.900, 0.926] between aMRI and cMRI, and 0.927 [0.908, 0.942] for cMRI; their difference was within the 0.05 margin for interchangeability. In 86 patients in whom a final HCC status could be determined, the detection sensitivity and specificity of aMRI was 0.921 [0.864, 0.956] and 0.886 [0.844, 0.918], within the 5% equivalence margin to cMRI, 0.936 [0.881, 0.965] and 0.883 [0.840, 0.915], respectively.; DATA CONCLUSION: Abbreviated-protocol screening MRI is interchangeable with, and equivalent to, complete-protocol diagnostic MRI for per-patient HCC detection in cirrhosis.; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Technical Efficacy: Stage 6 J.

AB BACKGROUND: Cancer patients with advanced disease routinely exhaust available clinical regimens and lack actionable genomic medicine results, leaving a large patient population without effective treatments options when their disease inevitably progresses. To address the unmet clinical need for evidence-based therapy assignment when standard clinical approaches have failed, we have developed a probabilistic computational modeling approach which integrates molecular sequencing data with functional assay data to develop patient-specific combination cancer treatments.; METHODS: Tissue taken from a murine model of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma was used to perform single agent drug screening and DNA/RNA sequencing experiments; results integrated via our computational modeling approach identified a synergistic personalized two-drug combination. Cells derived from the primary murine tumor were allografted into mouse models and used to validate the personalized two-drug combination. Computational modeling of single agent drug screening and RNA sequencing of multiple heterogenous sites from a single patient's epithelioid sarcoma identified a personalized two-drug combination effective across all tumor regions. The heterogeneity-consensus combination was validated in a xenograft model derived from the patient's primary tumor. Cell cultures derived from human and canine undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma were assayed by drug screen; computational modeling identified a resistance-abrogating two-drug combination common to both cell cultures. This combination was validated in vitro via a cell regrowth assay.; RESULTS: Our computational modeling approach addresses three major challenges in personalized cancer therapy: synergistic drug combination predictions (validated in vitro and in vivo in a genetically engineered murine cancer model), identification of unifying therapeutic targets to overcome intra-tumor heterogeneity (validated in vivo in a human cancer xenograft), and mitigation of cancer cell resistance and rewiring mechanisms (validated in vitro in a human and canine cancer model).; CONCLUSIONS: These proof-of-concept studies support the use of an integrative functional approach to personalized combination therapy prediction for the population of high-risk cancer patients lacking viable clinical options and without actionable DNA sequencing-based therapy.

AB Clinical guidelines advocate for customization of exercise testing to address patient-specific diagnostic goals, including reproduction of presenting exertional symptoms. However, the diagnostic yield of adding customized exercise testing to graded exercise in patients presenting with exertional complaints has not been rigorously examined and is the focus of this study. Using prospectively collected data, we analyzed the diagnostic yield of customized additional exercise provocation following inconclusive graded exercise test with measurement of gas exchange. Additional testing was defined as "positive" if it revealed a clinically-actionable diagnosis related to the chief complaint or reproduced symptoms in the absence of an explanatory diagnosis or pathology. Of 1,110 patients who completed a graded test, 122 (11%) symptomatic patients underwent additional customized exercise testing (e.g., sprint intervals and race simulations). Compared with those who did not undergo additional testing, this group was younger (29 [interquartile range 19 to 45] vs 46 [25 to 58] year old) and disproportionately female (43% vs 27%). Presenting symptoms included palpitations (46%), lightheadedness/syncope (25%), chest pain (14%), dyspnea (11%), and exertional intolerance (3%). Additional testing was "positive" in 48 of 122 (39%) of patients by revealing a clinically actionable diagnosis in 26 of 48 (54%) or reproducing symptoms without an explanatory diagnosis in 22 of 48 (46%). In conclusion, while patient-centered customization of exercise testing is suggested by clinical guidelines, these data are the first to demonstrate that the selective addition of customized exercise provocation following inconclusive graded exercise testing improves the diagnostic yield of exercise assessment.

AB PURPOSE: Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) using genome sequencing also reveals maternal copy-number variations (CNVs). Those CNVs can be clinically actionable or harmful to the fetus if inherited. CNVs in the DMD gene potentially causing dystrophinopathies are among the most commonly observed maternal CNVs. We present our experience with maternal DMD gene CNVs detected by NIPS.; METHODS: We analyzed the data of maternal CNVs detected in the DMD gene revealed by NIPS.; RESULTS: Of 26,123 NIPS analyses, 16 maternal CNVs in the DMD gene were detected (1/1632 pregnant women). Variant classification regarding pathogenicity and phenotypic severity was based on public databases, segregation analysis in the family, and prediction of the effect on the reading frame. Ten CNVs were classified as pathogenic, four as benign, and two remained unclassified.; CONCLUSION: NIPS leverages CNV screening in the general population of pregnant women. We implemented a strategy for the interpretation and the return of maternal CNVs in the DMD gene detected by NIPS.

AB BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is still the main cause of cancer death worldwide despite the availability of targeted therapies and immune-checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy. Cancer cell heterogeneity and primary or acquired resistance mechanisms cause the elusive behaviour of this cancer and new biomarkers and active drugs are urgently needed to overcome these limitations. p65BTK, a novel isoform of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase may represent a new actionable target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).; METHODS: p65BTK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 382 NSCLC patients with complete clinico-pathological records including smoking habit, ALK and EGFR status, and in metastatic lymph nodes of 30 NSCLC patients. NSCLC cell lines mutated for p53 and/or a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and primary lung cancer-derived cells from Kras/Trp53 null mice were used as a preclinical model. The effects of p65BTK inhibition by BTK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) (Ibrutinib, AVL-292, RN486) and first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib, Erlotinib) on cell viability were evaluated by MTT. The effects of BTK-TKIs on cell growth and clonogenicity were assessed by crystal violet and colony assays, respectively. Cell toxicity assays were performed to study the effect of the combination of non-toxic concentrations of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs and standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Gemcitabine, Pemetrexed).; RESULTS: p65BTK was significantly over-expressed in EGFR-wild type (wt) adenocarcinomas (AdC) from non-smoker patients and its expression was also preserved at the metastatic site. p65BTK was also over-expressed in cell lines mutated for KRAS or for a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and in tumors from Kras/Trp53 null mice. BTK-TKIs were more effective than EGFR-TKIs in decreasing cancer cell viability and significantly impaired cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Moreover, non-toxic doses of BTK-TKIs re-sensitized drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines to both target- and SOC therapy, independently from EGFR/KRAS status.; CONCLUSIONS: p65BTK results as an emerging actionable target in non-smoking EGFR-wt AdC, also at advanced stages of disease. Notably, these patients are not eligible for EGFR-TKIs-based therapy due to a lack of EGFR mutation. The combination of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs is cytotoxic for EGFR-wt/KRAS-mutant/p53-null tumors and BTK-TKIs re-sensitizes drug-resistant NSCLC to SOC chemotherapy. Therefore, our data suggest that adding BTK-TKIs to SOC chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapy may open new avenues for clinical trials in currently untreatable NSCLC.

AB BACKGROUND: The application of various tools suggests limitations in the usage of drug information provided to medical professionals. Concurrent views of utility and suggested improvements for written information by health care practitioners are lacking.; OBJECTIVE: This study's objectives were to: (1) assess practice-based perspectives on the relative efficacy and utility of different medication-related written materials for health care practitioners, (2) discern aspects of written communications that are valued for actionable information and merit health care practitioners' attention, (3) determine common or unique themes of clinicians practicing as physicians, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurses regarding medication-related written information; and (4) organize constructs and themes as a cogent array of current deficiencies in written communications to guide improvements.; METHODS: Two focus group panels (physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, nurses) were convened to address clinical decisional balance and the utility of written information about medicines in assisting them with those decisions. A facilitated dialogue followed a semi-structured interview guide including overarching questions and tap-root probes derived from the literature. Comparative analyses were used to interpret data. An a priori coding framework informed the interview guide and served as a basis for initial identification of themes.; RESULTS: Panelists from diverse practices and settings voiced convergent agreement on the limited utility of written materials, attributed primarily to current structure, formatting, content, and design. Recommendations thematically supported the need for greater accuracy, recency, adaptability, sequencing, and accessibility of information in formats more frequently digitalized.; CONCLUSIONS: Focus group panels of practitioners provided rich information on how current written information such as Dear Doctor letters and package inserts could be improved to facilitate real-time decision-making. Overall, improvements could contribute to an improved capacity for efficient, effective, and sustained evidence-based practice behavior. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Importance: Initial hemodialysis access with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is associated with superior clinical outcomes compared with arteriovenous graft (AVG) and should be the procedure of choice whenever possible. To address the national underuse of AVF in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid has established an AVF goal of 66% or greater in 2009.; Objective: To explore contemporary practice patterns and physician characteristics associated with high AVG use compared with AVF use.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This review of 100% Medicare Carrier claims between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, includes both inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data. All patients undergoing initial permanent hemodialysis access placement with an AVF or AVG were included. All surgeons performing more than 10 hemodialysis access procedures during the study period were analyzed.; Exposures: Placement of an AVF or AVG for initial permanent hemodialysis access.; Main Outcomes and Measures: A surgeon-level AVG (vs AVF) use rate was calculated for all included surgeons. Hierarchical logistic regression modeling was used to identify patient-level and surgeon-level factors associated with AVG use.; Results: A total of 85 320 patients (median age, 70 [range, 18-103] years; 47 370 men [55.5%]) underwent first-time hemodialysis access placement, of whom 66 489 (77.9%) had an AVF and 18 831 (22.1%) had an AVG. Among the 2397 surgeons who performed more than 10 procedures per year, the median surgeon level AVG use rate was 18.2% (range, 0.0%-96.4%). However, 498 surgeons (20.8%) had an AVG use rate greater than 34%. After accounting for patient characteristics, surgeon factors that were independently associated with AVG use included more than 30 years of clinical practice (vs 21-30 years; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.96]), metropolitan setting (odds ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.02-1.54]), and vascular surgery specialty (vs general surgery; odds ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69-0.86]). Surgeons in the Northeast region had the lowest rate of AVG use (vs the South; odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73-0.96]). First-time hemodialysis access benchmarking reports for individual surgeons were created for potential distribution.; Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, one-fifth of surgeons had an AVG use rate above the recommended best practices guideline of 34%. Although some of these differences may be explained by patient referral practices, sharing benchmarked performance data with surgeons could be an actionable step in achieving more high-value care in hemodialysis access surgery.

AB Brain tumors are the leading cause of death in children. Establishing an accurate diagnosis and therapy is critical for patient management. This study evaluated the clinical utility of GlioSeq, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, for the diagnosis and management of pediatric and young adult patients with brain tumors. Between May 2015 and March 2017, 142 consecutive brain tumors were tested using GlioSeq v1 and subset using GlioSeq v2. Out of 142 samples, 63% were resection specimens and 37% were small stereotactic biopsies. GlioSeq sequencing was successful in 100% and 98.6% of the cases for the detection of mutations and copy number changes, and gene fusions, respectively. Average turnaround time was 8.7days. Clinically significant genetic alterations were detected in 95%, 66.6%, and 66.1% of high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, and low-grade gliomas, respectively. GlioSeq enabled molecular-based stratification in 92 (65%) cases by specific molecular subtype assignment (70, 76.1%), substantiating a neuropathologic diagnosis (18, 19.6%), and diagnostic recategorization (4, 4.3%). Fifty-seven percent of the cases harbored therapeutically actionable findings. GlioSeq NGS analysis offers rapid detection of a wide range of genetic alterations across a spectrum of pediatric brain tumors using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens and facilitates integrated molecular-morphologic classification and personalized management of pediatric brain tumors. © 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Cancer cells become immortalized through telomere maintenance mechanisms, such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation. In addition to maintaining telomere length, TERT activates manifold cell survival signaling pathways. However, telomerase-associated gene signatures in cancer remain elusive.; METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of TERT high (TERThigh) and low (TERTlow) cancers using multidimensional data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Multidimensional data were analyzed by propensity score matching weight algorithm. Coexpression networks were constructed by weight gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Random forest classifiers were generated to identify cancer subtypes.; RESULTS: The TERThigh-specific mRNA expression signature is associated with cell cycle-related coexpression modules across cancer types. Experimental screening of hub genes in the cell cycle module suggested TPX2 and EXO1 as potential regulators of telomerase activity and cell survival. MiRNA analysis revealed that the TERThigh-specific miR-17-92 cluster can target biological processes enriched in TERTlow cancer and that its expression is negatively correlated with the tumor/normal telomere length ratio. Intriguingly, TERThigh cancers tend to have mutations in extracellular matrix organization genes and amplify MAPK signaling. By mining the clinical actionable gene database, we uncovered a number of TERThigh-specific somatic mutations, amplifications and high expression genes containing therapeutic targets. Finally, a random forest classifier integrating telomerase-associated multi-omics signatures identifies two cancer subtypes showed profound differences in telomerase activity and patient survival.; CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results depict a telomerase-associated molecular landscape in cancers and provide therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.

AB Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that carries dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, is present throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). To reduce mosquitoborne disease transmission, the USVI Department of Health (VIDOH) is responsible for integrated mosquito management. During January 2016-January 2018, USVI experienced its first Zika outbreak, with most cases reported during January-December 2016, as well as two Category 5 hurricanes (Irma on St. Thomas/St. John on September 6, 2017, and Maria on St. Croix on September 19, 2017). The hurricanes severely damaged mosquito protection-related building structures (e.g., screens, roofs) and infrastructure (e.g., electricity, air conditioning) and might have created an environment more conducive to mosquito breeding. VIDOH, with requested technical assistance from CDC, conducted three Community Assessments for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPERs) to provide rapid community information at the household level. The three CASPERs were conducted to inform 1) the Zika outbreak response, 2) the hurricane response, and 3) the hurricane recovery. The CASPERs assessed mosquito prevention and control-related experiences, attitudes, and practices; household and environmental conditions associated with mosquito breeding, prevention, and control; and other nonmosquito-related information to inform outbreak and disaster response planning. Approximately 40% of households were very concerned about contracting Zika virus during the Zika outbreak and hurricane responses. Environmental conditions were reported to become more favorable for mosquito breeding between the Zika outbreak and hurricane response. Between 75%-80% of the community supported mosquito-spraying in all assessments. VIDOH used these data to support real-time outbreak and hurricane response planning. Mosquito prevention and control community assessments can provide rapid, actionable information to advise both mosquito education and control and emergency response and recovery efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: Both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma incur heavy health care burdens. To support tailored preventive care for these 2 diseases, predictive modeling is widely used to give warnings and to identify patients for care management. However, 3 gaps exist in current modeling methods owing to rarely factoring in temporal aspects showing trends and early health change: (1) existing models seldom use temporal features and often give late warnings, making care reactive. A health risk is often found at a relatively late stage of declining health, when the risk of a poor outcome is high and resolving the issue is difficult and costly. A typical model predicts patient outcomes in the next 12 months. This often does not warn early enough. If a patient will actually be hospitalized for COPD next week, intervening now could be too late to avoid the hospitalization. If temporal features were used, this patient could potentially be identified a few weeks earlier to institute preventive therapy; (2) existing models often miss many temporal features with high predictive power and have low accuracy. This makes care management enroll many patients not needing it and overlook over half of the patients needing it the most; (3) existing models often give no information on why a patient is at high risk nor about possible interventions to mitigate risk, causing busy care managers to spend more time reviewing charts and to miss suited interventions. Typical automatic explanation methods cannot handle longitudinal attributes and fully address these issues.; OBJECTIVE: To fill these gaps so that more COPD and asthma patients will receive more appropriate and timely care, we will develop comprehensible data-driven methods to provide accurate early warnings of poor outcomes and to suggest tailored interventions, making care more proactive, efficient, and effective.; METHODS: By conducting a secondary data analysis and surveys, the study will: (1) use temporal features to provide accurate early warnings of poor outcomes and assess the potential impact on prediction accuracy, risk warning timeliness, and outcomes; (2) automatically identify actionable temporal risk factors for each patient at high risk for future hospital use and assess the impact on prediction accuracy and outcomes; and (3) assess the impact of actionable information on clinicians' acceptance of early warnings and on perceived care plan quality.; RESULTS: We are obtaining clinical and administrative datasets from 3 leading health care systems' enterprise data warehouses. We plan to start data analysis in 2020 and finish our study in 2025.; CONCLUSIONS: Techniques to be developed in this study can boost risk warning timeliness, model accuracy, and generalizability; improve patient finding for preventive care; help form tailored care plans; advance machine learning for many clinical applications; and be generalized for many other chronic diseases.; INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/13783. ©Gang Luo, Bryan L Stone, Corinna Koebnick, Shan He, David H Au, Xiaoming Sheng, Maureen A Murtaugh, Katherine A Sward, Michael Schatz, Robert S Zeiger, Giana H Davidson, Flory L Nkoy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) occurs frequently in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and confers a poor prognosis. Multiplex profiling of primary GACs has been insightful but the underpinnings of PC's development/progression remain largely unknown. We characterised exome/transcriptome/immune landscapes of PC cells from patients with GAC aiming to identify novel therapeutic targets.; DESIGN: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on 44 PC specimens (43 patients with PC) including an integrative analysis of WES, RNA-seq, immune profile, clinical and pathological phenotypes to dissect the molecular pathogenesis, identifying actionable targets and/or biomarkers and comparison with TCGA primary GACs.; RESULTS: We identified distinct alterations in PC versus primary GACs, such as more frequent CDH1 and TAF1 mutations, 6q loss and chr19 gain. Alterations associated with aggressive PC phenotypes emerged with increased mutations in TP53, CDH1, TAF1 and KMT2C, higher level of 'clock-like' mutational signature, increase in whole-genome doublings, chromosomal instability (particularly, copy number losses), reprogrammed microenvironment, enriched cell cycle pathways, MYC activation and impaired immune response. Integrated analysis identified two main molecular subtypes: 'mesenchymal-like' and 'epithelial-like' with discriminating response to chemotherapy (31% vs 71%). Patients with the less responsive 'mesenchymal-like' subtype had high expression of immune checkpoint T-Cell Immunoglobulin And Mucin Domain-Containing Protein 3 (TIM-3), its ligand galectin-9, V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) and transforming growth factor-beta as potential therapeutic immune targets.; CONCLUSIONS: We have uncovered the unique mutational landscape, copy number alteration and gene expression profile of PC cells and defined PC molecular subtypes, which correlated with PC therapy resistance/response. Novel targets and immune checkpoint proteins have been identified with a potential to be translated into clinics. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB Importance: Implementation of pharmacogenetic testing to guide drug prescribing has potential to improve drug response and prevent adverse events. Robust data exist for more than 30 gene-drug pairs linking genotype to drug response phenotypes; however, it is unclear which pharmacogenetic tests, if implemented, would provide the greatest utility for a given patient population.; Objectives: To project the proportion of veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) with actionable pharmacogenetic variants and evaluate how testing might be associated with prescribing decisions.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included veterans who used national VHA pharmacy services from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2017. Data analyses began April 26, 2018, and were completed February 6, 2019.; Exposures: Receipt of level A drugs based on VHA pharmacy dispensing records.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Projected prevalence of actionable pharmacogenetic variants among VHA pharmacy users based on variant frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project and veteran demographic characteristics; incident number of level A prescriptions, and proportion of new level A drug recipients projected to carry an actionable pharmacogenetic variant.; Results: During the study, 7 769 359 veterans (mean [SD] age, 58.1 [17.8] years; 7 021 504 [90.4%] men) used VHA pharmacy services. It was projected that 99% of VHA pharmacy users would carry at least 1 actionable pharmacogenetic variant. Among VHA pharmacy users, 4 259 153 (54.8%) received at least 1 level A drug with 1 188 124 (15.3%) receiving 2 drugs, and 912 189 (11.7%) receiving 3 or more drugs. The most common incident prescriptions during the study were tramadol (923 671 new recipients), simvastatin (533 928 new recipients), citalopram (266 952 new recipients), and warfarin (205 177 new recipients). Gene-drug interactions projected to have substantial clinical impacts in the VHA population include the interaction of SLCO1B1 with simvastatin (1 988 956 veterans [25.6%]), CYP2D6 with tramadol (318 544 veterans [4.1%]), and CYP2C9 or VKORC1 with warfarin (7 163 349 veterans [92.2%]).; Conclusions and Relevance: Clinically important pharmacogenetic variants are highly prevalent in the VHA population. Almost all veterans would carry an actionable variant, and more than half of the population had been exposed to a drug affected by these variants. These results suggest that pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to affect pharmacotherapy decisions for commonly prescribed outpatient medications for many veterans.

AB Background: Up to 15% of young adults with glioblastoma have the activating oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation, an actionable target of the MAPK signal transduction pathway governing tumor cell proliferation. Small molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK, a downstream protein immediately following BRAF, have been shown to confer a survival advantage for patients with BRAF V600E mutant advanced melanoma. We describe our experience using this combined target therapy for two patients with BRAFV600E mutant glioblastoma (GBM) as primary treatment due to extenuating clinical circumstances that prohibited the prescription of standard treatment.; Case Presentation: The two patients were both 22 years old on presentation. After the initial tumor resection, they both developed rapid deterioration in performance status within a few weeks due to leptomeningeal metastases. In view of the critical condition, BRAF and MEK inhibitors were prescribed as first line treatment. The two patients both achieved dramatic clinical response, which was parallel to the impressive radiological regression of the disease. Unfortunately, the duration of disease control was short as drug resistance developed rapidly. The two patients died 7 and 7.5 month after initial diagnosis of GBM.; Conclusions: Primary treatment with inhibitors of BRAF and MEK can lead to tumor regression for patients with BRAF V600E mutant glioblastoma. We therefore recommend that all young GBM patients should undergo BRAFV600E mutation testing, especially for those with unusual aggressive clinical course.

AB PURPOSE: To examine how qualitative narrative comments and quantitative ratings from end-of-rotation assessments change for a cohort of residents from entry to graduation, and explore associations between narrative feedback and quantitative ratings.; METHOD: The authors obtained end-of-rotation quantitative ratings and narrative comments for one cohort of internal medicine residents at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine over three years, July 2013-June 2016. They inductively identified themes in comments, coded orientation (praising/critical) and relevance (specificity and actionability) of feedback, examined associations between codes and ratings, and evaluated changes in themes and ratings across years.; RESULTS: Data comprised 1,869 assessments (828 comments) on 33 residents. Five themes aligned with ACGME competencies (interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, medical knowledge, patient care, and systems-based practice) and three did not (personal attributes, summative judgement, and comparison to training level). Work ethic was the most frequent subtheme. Comments emphasized medical knowledge more in year 1 and focused more on autonomy, leadership, and teaching in later years. Most comments (714/828 [86%]) contained high praise and 412/828 (50%) were very relevant. Average ratings correlated positively with orientation (beta = 0.46, P < .001) and negatively with relevance (beta = -0.09, P = .01). Ratings increased significantly with each training year (year 1, mean [standard deviation]: 5.3 [0.6]; year 2: 5.6 [0.5]; year 3: 5.9 [0.4]; P < .001).; CONCLUSIONS: Narrative comments address resident attributes beyond the ACGME competencies and change as residents progress. Lower quantitative ratings are associated with more specific and actionable feedback.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) either alone or in combination with chemotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, only a small percentage of mCRC patients receive clinical benefits from anti-EGFR therapies, due to the development of resistance mechanisms. In this regard, HER2has emerged as an actionable target in the treatment of mCRC patients with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.; METHODS: We have used SW48 and LIM1215 human colon cancer cell lines, quadruple wild-type for KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PI3KCA genes, and their HER2-amplified (LIM1215-HER2 and SW48-HER2) derived cells to perform in vitro and in vivo studies in order to identify novel therapeutic strategies in HER2 gene amplified human colorectal cancer.; RESULTS: LIM1215-HER2 and SW48-HER2cells showed over-expression and activation of the HER family receptors and concomitant intracellular downstream signaling including the pro-survival PI3KCA/AKT and the mitogenic RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathways. HER2-amplified cells were treated with several agents including anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab, SYM004 and MM151); anti-HER2 (trastuzumab, pertuzumab and lapatinib) inhibitors; anti-HER3 (duligotuzumab) inhibitors; and MEK and PI3KCA inhibitors, such as refametinib and pictilisib, as single agents and in combination. Subsequently, different in vivo experiments have been performed. MEK plus PI3KCA inhibitors treatment determined the best antitumor activity. These results were validated in vivo in HER2-amplified patient derived tumor xenografts fromthree metastatic colorectal cancer patients.; CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that combined therapy with MEK and PI3KCA inhibitorscould represent a novel and effective treatment option for HER2-amplified colorectal cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths, and an increased number of GC patients adopt to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify tumor genomic alterations for precision medicine.; METHODS: In this study, we established a hybridization capture-based NGS panel including 612 cancer-associated genes, and collected sequencing data of tumors and matched bloods from 153 gastric cancer patients. We performed comprehensive analysis of these sequencing and clinical data.; RESULTS: 35 significantly mutated genes were identified such as TP53, AKAP9, DRD2, PTEN, CDH1, LRP2 et al. Among them, 29 genes were novel significantly mutated genes compared with TCGA study. TP53 is the top frequently mutated gene, and tends to mutate in male (p=0.025) patients and patients whose tumor located in cardia (p=0.011). High tumor mutation burden (TMB) gathered in TP53 wild-type tumors (p=0.045). TMB was also significantly associated with DNA damage repair (DDR) genes genotype (p=0.047), Lauren classification (p=1.5e-5), differentiation (1.9e-7), and HER2 status (p=0.023). 38.31% of gastric cancer patients harbored at least one actionable alteration according to OncoKB database.; CONCLUSIONS: We drew a comprehensive mutational landscape of 153 gastric tumors and demonstrated utility of target next-generation sequencing to guide clinical management.

AB Mutations affect gene functions related to cancer behavior, including cell growth, metastasis, and drug responses. Genome-wide profiling of cancer mutations and drug responses has identified actionable targets that can be utilized for the management of cancer patients. Here, the recapitulation of pharmacogenomic data revealed that the mutation of EPHB6 is associated with paclitaxel resistance in cancer cells. Experimental data confirmed that the EPHB6 mutation induces paclitaxel resistance in various cancer types, including lung, skin, and liver cancers. EPHB6 mutation-induced paclitaxel resistance was mediated by an interaction with EPHA2, which promotes c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated cadherin 11 (CDH11) expression. We demonstrated that EPHB6-mutated cells acquire cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) in association with CDH11 expression and RhoA/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Targeted inhibition of EPHA2 or CDH11 reversed the acquired paclitaxel resistance, suggesting its potential clinical utility. The present results suggest that the EPHB6 mutation and its downstream EPHA2/JNK/CDH11/RhoA/FAK signaling axis are novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in cancer patients.

AB Despite growing interest in data visualization and graphically aided reporting, the evaluation literature could benefit from additional guidance on systematically integrating visual communication design and marketing into comprehensive communication strategies to improve data dissemination. This article describes the role of targeted communication strategies-based on visual communications, design, and marketing theory-in producing more effective reports. In evaluation practice, well-synthesized and translated reports often require the integration of data from multiple sources, methods, and/or time points to communicate complex findings in ways that elicit productive responses. Visual communication strategies, such as project branding or designing actionable tools with marketing principles in mind, can be applied to optimize effective reporting of complex evaluation findings. This article references a longitudinal, mixed-method evaluation of public school administrators in Michigan to illustrate the application of a systematic communication design framework to produce several graphically aided project materials and subsequent findings reports.

AB Objective. To assess the value of an advanced pharmacy practice experience in which students engaged in population health management (PHM) activities for a managed care setting. Methods. Students were provided with a list of patients, trained on the requirements for each PHM activity and completed them independently. The students reviewed the electronic record for each patient on their list to identify those who were non-adherent to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) within one year of coronary stent placement, non-adherent to beta blockers (BB) within six months post-acute myocardial infarction, or with renal dysfunction and requiring dose adjustment of lipid-lowering therapy. Students coded each intervention based on predefined categories such as patient education, medication discontinuation, or medication reconciliation, and then if necessary were reviewed with the pharmacy preceptor. The primary investigator determined the intervention to be either actionable or non-actionable. The primary outcome was the proportion and type of interventions made by each student. The secondary outcome was clinical pharmacist time offset. A retrospective, data-only pilot study was conducted to determine the outcomes from the program over four years. Results. Forty-six students made 3,774 interventions over the study period, 37% of which were categorized as actionable. The most common actionable interventions were providing patient education (52%), verifying prescription adherence (23%), and medication therapy adjustment (10.5%). Over the study period, an estimated 765.6 hours of clinical pharmacist time was offset, or approximately 191.4 hours per academic year. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that a population health management approach can be used successfully within an APPE. This approach can result in offset pharmacist time for precepting organizations, while offering meaningful clinical interventions for patients and learning opportunities for students.

AB Background: Ensuring the quality of health service data is critical for data-driven decision-making. Data quality assessments (DQAs) are used to determine if data are of sufficient quality to support their intended use. However, guidance on how to conduct DQAs specifically for community-based interventions, such as integrated community case management (iCCM) programs, is limited. As part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Rapid Access Expansion (RAcE) Programme, ICF conducted DQAs in a unique effort to characterize the quality of community health worker-generated data and to use DQA findings to strengthen reporting systems and decision-making.; Methods: We present our experience implementing assessments using standardized DQA tools in the six RAcE project sites in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, and Nigeria. We describe the process used to create the RAcE DQA tools, adapt the tools to country contexts, and develop the iCCM DQA Toolkit, which enables countries to carry out regular and rapid DQAs. We provide examples of how we used results to generate recommendations.; Results: The DQA tools were customized for each RAcE project to assess the iCCM data reporting system, trace iCCM indicators through this system, and to ensure that DQAs were efficient and generated useful recommendations. This experience led to creation of an iCCM DQA Toolkit comprised of simplified versions of RAcE DQA tools and a guidance document. It includes system assessment questions that elicit actionable responses and a simplified data tracing tool focused on one treatment indicator for each iCCM focus illness: diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia. The toolkit is intended for use at the national or sub-national level for periodic data quality checks.; Conclusions: The iCCM DQA Toolkit was designed to be easily tailored to different data reporting system structures because iCCM data reporting tools and data flow vary substantially. The toolkit enables countries to identify points in the reporting system where data quality is compromised and areas of the reporting system that require strengthening, so that countries can make informed adjustments that improve data quality, strengthen reporting systems, and inform decision-making.

AB Objectives: Nutritional metabolomics to objectively assess dietary intake in aging permit the opportunity to circumvent measurement errors that accompany subjective means of dietary assessment. At the same time, they may offer insights into mechanisms of action and metabolic disturbances that are actionable targets for modulation through diet in hopes of disease prevention and treatment. However, prior to more broad deployment the pre-analytical and temporal variation over time should be documented in order to design and interpret epidemiological studies properly. We quantified and examined 155 nutrient biomarkers and metabolites selected for their potential relevance to dementia.; Methods: Blood samples from three time points, spanning a 2-year period, were obtained from older adults participating in the NIA-Layton Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center's Nutrition and Brain Aging Study (NBAS). Blood samples were batched randomly across three time points for quantification of blood amino acids, minerals, water and fat-soluble micronutrients, lipids, one carbon, and kynurenine pathway metabolites using a variety of methods including, tandem mass spectrometry. Pre-analytical coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for all the biomarkers and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to evaluate the within-person reproducibility in a subset of 137 participants.; Results: The mean baseline age of the analytic sample (n=137) was 85.6 (±8.3, 57 - 101 years), 70% are female, 21% carry the ApoEe4 allele and MMSE was 28.3 (±1.78). The pre-analytical CVs ranged from 0.9% to 55.0% and the ICC ranged from 0 to 0.87 (25%-tile/ median /75%-tile 0.41/ 0.54 /0.66). Twenty four % had ICC<0.40, 66% had ICC 0.40 -0.75 and 10% had ICC>0.75.; Conclusions: The pre-analytical and within-person reproducibility of nutritional metabolomics in aging ranges widely. The majority can reliably estimate average concentrations over a 2 year period from a single time point and the biomarkers with ICC's above 0.40 can be used for correction of measurement error and those below 0.40 should consider multiple samples per subject and exploring the methodological and biological explanation for the variation over time.; Funding Sources: Nestle Institute of Health Sciences, Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research, NIA-Layton Aging & Alzheimer's Disease Center (P30AGO8017).

AB Objectives: There is a growing global demand for information to track nutritional status and its determinants, including intervention coverage. We developed an online survey to identify which nutrition indicators and data sources the global nutrition community uses currently and what information gaps remain.; Methods: We created the survey using Qualtrics software and distributed it through multiple online nutrition-focused listservs and professional networks. Respondents were asked about their professional background, use of nutrition indicators in previous year, sources of accessed data, unfilled data needs, and how they used data in their work. Data were collected from July 16 to August 16 2018. Results were tabulated using Stata Version 14.0.; Results: A total of 264 survey responses were received, 235 with responses beyond identifiers. The majority of stakeholders were from NGO and research communities. Two-thirds reported using data to make monitoring and evaluation decisions (Table 1). Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) were the most accessed national data source in the past year (74%), followed by the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (42%) (Table 2). When data sources were stratified by respondent geographic focus area (single country vs. multi-country), 60% of stakeholders with a single country focus and 85% of stakeholders with a multi-country focus accessed the DHS. Among stakeholders who accessed aggregated data sources, most accessed the Global Nutrition Report (75%).The majority of respondents accessed or used at least one nutrition coverage or utilization indicator in the last 12 months (97%) including iron and folic acid supplementation for pregnant or lactating women (54%) (Figure 1). Several challenges to accessing and using data were identified such as data sometimes or frequently not being available at the geographical level needed (82%) or being out of out-of-date (77%) (Figure 2).; Conclusions: High-quality, actionable nutrition data are needed to understand progress towards reducing malnutrition and reaching global nutrition targets. Effective monitoring of progress in nutrition requires data that are accessible to decision makers who assess programs and allocate resources.; Funding Sources: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.; Supporting Tables Images and/or Graphs:

AB Objectives: High population coverage of fortified foods is needed for a fortification program to be impactful yet there is a dearth of data on the extent of consumption of foods targeted for fortification and foods in a fortifiable form (i.e., processed in an industry or value chain where fortification can occur). This is driven in part by a lack of tools to assess coverage. The objective of this work was to develop standardized indicators to assess coverage of fortified foods in population-based fortification programs.; Methods: A Fortification Assessment Coverage Toolkit (FACT) was developed to assess household coverage defined as: 1) consumption of a vehicle; 2) consumption of a fortifiable vehicle; and 3) consumption of a fortified vehicle. Validated risk factors associated with poor micronutrient intakes (e.g., poverty, rural residence, low dietary diversity) are also assessed to determine equity in coverage across vulnerable population subgroups. The FACT method was piloted in Ghana in 2013 then operationalized in 16 countries in 2014-2017.; Results: FACT results were found to be actionable and to drive programmatic and policy decisions. In Nigeria, results revealed universal coverage of fortifiable bouillon (>99%) indicating its potential as a fortification vehicle and were used to advocate for bouillon fortification in West Africa. In Pakistan, results revealed a large proportion of fortifiable wheat flour consumed was from small-scale chakki mills (32-60%), which resulted in a feasibility assessment of chakki mill fortification to understand the program's potential for impact. In Nigeria and Tanzania, large differences in coverage of fortifiable and fortified foods (8-17% for wheat flour, 3-34% for maize flour, 16-39% for oil and 11-33% for salt) revealed quality issues, which resulted in increased donor funding to improve quality and compliance. In 2018, coverage indicators were tested in PMA2020 surveys in Kenya and Burkina Faso to determine their potential in large surveys such as Demographic Health and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys.; Conclusions: FACT has filled a gap in standardized tools to assess fortification program coverage and generate data for decision-making. The integration of FACT indicators in recurring national surveys will allow for more comprehensive tracking of coverage over time.; Funding Sources: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID.

AB Objectives: Food price data is routinely collected by governments but has not been utilized to its full potential for tracking the cost of nutritious diets. Food prices typically are used to monitor the cost of a basket of goods purchased by consumers, which may bear little relation to recommended diets. National food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) attempt to provide specific, actionable recommendations for diets that meet nutritional needs and protect long-term health, based on expert evidence review and in-country dialogue. The objective of this research is to show how governments can use their food price data to track the cost of meeting FBDG.; Methods: The Cost of Recommended Diets (CoRD) is an estimate of the minimum cost of meeting FBDG. It requires data on food prices and quantitative FBDG. Food price data can be sourced from national statistical organizations that track inflation using a Consumer Price Index (CPI); from ministries of food/agriculture/trade; and from national household budget surveys. CoRD is calculated by identifying the least-cost 2-3 foods (by edible portion) in each food category contained in FBDG (e.g., starchy staples, protein foods, dairy, fruits, vegetables, oils), and summing the mean cost of obtaining the average gram amounts of each group. We demonstrate the results of CoRD using data from Ghana. A stakeholder dialogue was conducted with official food price data collectors in Ghana in 2016-2018 on the applicability of CoRD within existing monitoring systems.; Results: Using data from the Ghana Statistical Service and the Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), we find that meeting FBDG for vegetables and fruits is relatively expensive compared to starchy staples and the cheapest forms of protein foods, and that consumers typically underspend on fruits and vegetables compared to the expenditure shares required to obtain recommended amounts. MoFA has made changes in their food price monitoring system to enable tracking of CoRD.; Conclusions: The CoRD indicator is a policy-coherent metric of food prices that measures the cost of meeting FBDG. It rests on existing data and can be incorporated into national food price monitoring systems.; Funding Sources: Funding for this work is provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and DFID, partially through an IMMANA (Innovative Metrics and Methods for Agriculture and Nutrition Actions) grant.

AB Objectives: To discuss good practices and criteria for optimal design and interpretation of pre-clinical and clinical natural product (NP) research in order to increase benefit from our investment in NP clinical trials (CT). Background: Large, randomized, controlled CT often fail to reject the null hypothesis or show rigorous evidence of benefit. This includes recent large, NIH-supported CT of nutrients such as vitamin D and selenium, and of botanical dietary supplements. Negative and positive outcomes may be equally important for public health, but because large CT cost at least $20 M each, plus opportunity costs, it is important that CT designs maximize the yield of actionable information regardless of outcome.; Methods: Experts and stakeholders from academia, government and the private sector collaboratively developed a broadly attended workshop in which good practices to enhance rigor, reproducibility and translational relevance were discussed.; Results: N/A.; Conclusions: Critical issues in CT design include product identity, reproducibility and pharmacology (where feasible), power to test a primary outcome significant to consumers, and placebo controls. When basing a CT on traditional use or prior in vitro or in vivo studies, similarity of product (e.g., source identity, methods of preparation, form and intake), health outcome and population (e.g., age, sex, genetics, diet and environment), require careful consideration. Appropriate controls for known types of in vitro assay interference (e.g., aggregation, membrane disruption, protein denaturation) are imperative. Compounds with limited bioavailability, or activity only at concentrations above those achievable by ingestion, are likely poor candidates for dietary CT. Translational validity of model systems should be carefully assessed. Appropriate analyses (e.g., p-curve and meta-regression methods) should be used to obtain bias-corrected effect size estimates, and to identify research areas where the evidence base may be weaker than published findings suggest. Finally, CT prioritization should consider expected impact on public health, and whether known NP causal mechanisms of action are such that useful information, e.g., on product bioavailability or biological activity, are generated even if the completed CT fails to reject the null hypothesis.; Funding Sources: NIH, FDA, USDA.

AB Use of precision medicine in oncology is burgeoning and can provide patients with new treatment options. However, it is not clear how precision medicine is impacting healthcare professionals (HCPs), particularly with regards to their concerns about this new approach. We therefore synthesized the existing literature on HCPs' attitudes toward cancer precision medicine. We searched four databases for relevant articles. Two reviewers screened eligible articles and extracted data. We assessed the quality of each article using the QualSyst tool. We found 22 articles, representing 4,321 HCPs (63.7% cancer specialists). HCPs held largely positive attitudes toward cancer precision medicine, including their capacity to facilitate treatment decisions and provide prognostic information. However, they also had concerns regarding costs, insurance coverage, limited HCP knowledge about precision medicine, potential misuse, difficulties accessing the tests, and delays in receiving test results. Most HCPs felt that test-related decisions should be shared between families and HCPs. HCPs intended to disclose actionable results but were less inclined to disclose negative/secondary findings. HCPs had a strong preference for genetic counselor involvement when disclosing germline findings. Most HCPs intended to use somatic and germline tests in their future practice but the extent to which pharmacogenomic tests will be used is uncertain. HCPs indicated that additional evidence supporting test utility and increased availability of treatment guidelines could facilitate the use of testing. HCPs held generally positive attitudes toward cancer precision medicine, however there were some key concerns. Addressing concerns early, devising educational support for HCPs and developing guidelines may facilitate the successful implementation of precision medicine trials in the future.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Common Residency Program Requirements stipulate that each faculty member's performance be evaluated annually. Feedback is essential to this process, yet the culture of medicine poses challenges to developing effective feedback systems. The current study explores existing and ideal characteristics of faculty teaching evaluation systems from the perspectives of key stakeholders: faculty, residents, and residency program directors (PDs).; METHODS: We utilized two qualitative approaches: (1) confidential semistructured telephone interviews with PDs from a convenience sample of eight family medicine residency programs, (2) qualitative responses from an anonymous online survey of faculty and residents in the same eight programs. We used inductive thematic analysis to analyze the interviews and survey responses. Data collection occurred in the fall of 2017.; RESULTS: All eight (100%) of the PDs completed interviews. Survey response rates for faculty and residents were 79% (99/126) and 70% (152/216), respectively. Both PD and faculty responses identified a desire for actionable, real-time, frequent feedback used to foster continued professional development. Themes unique to faculty included easy accessibility and feedback from peers. Residents expressed an interest in in-person feedback and a process minimizing potential retribution. Residents indicated that feedback should be based on shared understanding of what skill(s) the faculty member is trying to address.; CONCLUSIONS: PDs, faculty, and residents share a desire to provide faculty with meaningful, specific, and real-time feedback. Programs should strive to provide a culture in which feedback is an integral part of the learning process for both residents and faculty.

AB Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. A number of targeted therapies have been approved for clinical use or are in clinical trials. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is widely applied in the identification of actionable genomic alterations and enables personalized cancer therapy for patients. Several multiple-gene panels are available in China for the practice of precision medicine-based cancer therapy. However, the efficiency of these panels requires evaluation. The current study investigated 23 NSCLC samples using a custom designed panel of complete coding regions of ~180 cancer driver genes (FD-180) and whole exome sequencing for control samples, obtained from white blood cell samples. The results obtained suggested that actionable mutations with available targeted therapeutic options were identified in 69.6% of cases, including 60.9% of therapeutic targets recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Furthermore, 8.7% of patients had a gene mutation that potentially qualified them for clinical trials or associated off-label therapies. As such, the results obtained in the current study demonstrated the reliability of the targeted NGS panel and its potential use for identifying actionable gene alterations and designing personalized therapies for patients with NSCLC.

AB Introduction: The systemic treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed dramatically with the identification of actionable mutations and the use of targeted agents. Unfortunately, many tumors will acquire resistance and >75% of NSCLC cases lack for an actionable gene aberration. In this setting, immunotherapy rises as effective therapeutic where immune checkpoint inhibitors have entered or are entering the market in many neoplasms, including NSCLC. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4, promoting T-cell activation and its subsequent anti-tumoral immune effect. Ipilimumab might have a very important role in NSCLC as it does in melanoma because of its synergistic effect with PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors. Areas covered: We summarize current results of clinical studies of ipilimumab for efficacy and safety in NSCLC and also the current knowledge about potential biomarkers for its efficacy. Expert Opinion: Combined use of PD-1/PDL-1 and anti-CTL4 inhibitors increases the efficacy against NSCLC and it is a very promising approach not only in NSCLC but also in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for first or second-line therapy. It's very important to identify biomarkers that can better select the population of patients that benefit the most with these checkpoint inhibitors.

AB BACKGROUND: A reliable and valid clinically practical multi-domain self-report and caregiver-report tool is needed for tracking actionable symptoms in primary care for elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs).; OBJECTIVE: Assess internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity to change for SymTrak.; DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Among 600 (200 patient-caregiver dyads, 200 patients without an identified caregiver) participants, SymTrak was telephone interviewer-administered at baseline and 3-month follow-up, and at 24h post-baseline for assessing test-retest reliability in a random subsample of 180 (60 dyads, 60 individual patients) participants.; MAIN MEASURES: Demographic questions, SymTrak, Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3).; KEY RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis indicated a single dominant dimension for SymTrak items for both patients and caregivers. Coefficient alpha and 24-h test-retest reliability, respectively, were high for the 23-item SymTrak total score for both patient-reported (0.85; 0.87) and caregiver-reported (0.86; 0.91) scores. Construct validity was supported by monotone decreasing relationships between the mean of SymTrak total scores across the poor-to-excellent categories of physical and emotional general health, and by high correlations with HUI3 overall utility score, even after adjusting for demographic covariates (standardized linear regression coefficient=-0.84 for patients; -0.70 for caregivers). Three-month change in the SymTrak total score was sensitive to detecting criterion standard 3-month reliable change categories (Improved, Stable, Declined) in HUI3-based health-related quality of life, especially for caregiver-reported scores.; CONCLUSIONS: SymTrak demonstrates good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity to change over a 3-month period, supporting its use for monitoring symptoms for older adults with MCCs.

AB In 2010, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDoC) as a research framework aimed at advancing research into the etiology of mental disorders, the development of clinically actionable biomarkers, and the eventual development of precision medications. The foundation of RDoC in that first phase rested in the assumption that mental disorders are brain disorders that originate in aberrant neural circuitry, and that therapeutic advances could flow from alterations in that circuitry. RDoC proposed a matrix of psychological constructs with seven levels of analysis ranging from the cell to self-report, but with neural circuitry at the center. In 2016, another model was proposed in which neural circuitry became equivalent to other units of analyses. With the advent of a new Director of the NIMH, the emphasis returned to neural circuitry as a priority, along with computational psychiatry. Have these shifts undermined the RDoC project?

AB Immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies have therapeutic activity against relapsed or progressive classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), but Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells can develop resistance to this therapy via multiple mechanisms. To improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade, we need a more precise understanding of the immune escape mechanisms active in individual cHL patients, and this requires a detailed characterization of immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. These cell-cell interactions can now be studied by multiplex immunohistochemistry coupled to digital image analysis. This method should allow the identification of actionable target molecules mediating resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in individual cHL patients, thereby favoring the implementation of personalized therapies. © 2019 The Authors.

AB The aim of this research was to evaluate the patient education materials prepared and published by nurses and physicians in terms of the qualitative properties of these materials, including readability, understandability, and actionability. A total of 38 patient education materials prepared by nurses and physicians in a university hospital in Turkey were evaluated. The readability of the materials was assessed using the formulas proposed by Atesman and Cetinkaya. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) form was used for estimating the understandability and actionability. Data were analyzed using the percentile and mean values, and the Kendall's Tau-c and correlation tests were used for interobserver agreement. According to the assessments based on the readability formulas, 55.3% of the materials were moderately difficult, while 81.6% had instructional-level readability (U.S. Grades 8 and 9) with a moderate to low level of understandability and actionability. Consequently, the patient education materials evaluated in our study had a moderate level of readability, understandability, and actionability.

AB Although there is evidence of a significant rise of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) incidence, current treatments are largely insufficient due to somewhat poor knowledge of these tumours. Despite many efforts achieved to expose driver oncogene mutations in NETs, the genetic landscape of NETs is characterized by relatively few mutations and chromosomal aberrations per tumour compared with other tumour types. In addition, NETs display few actionable mutations providing compelling rationale for targeted therapies. Recent works aiming at characterizing currently used NETs in vitro models at the genomic level raised concerns on their reliability as bona fide tools to study NETs biology. However, the lack of actionable mutation in NETs implies that sole use of genomic is not sufficient to describe these models and establish appropriate therapeutic strategies. Several kinases and kinase-involving signalling pathways have been demonstrated as abnormally regulated in NETs. Yet, kinases have only been investigated regardless of their involvement in large intracellular signalling networks. In order to assess the validity of in vitro NETs models to study NETs biology, "next-generation" high throughput functional technologies based on "kinome-wide activity" will demonstrate the similarities between signalling pathways in NETs models and patients' samples. These approaches will significantly assist in identifying actionable alterations in NETs signalling pathways and guide patient stratification into early-phase clinical trials based on kinase inhibition targeted therapies.

AB OBJECTIVE: Respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (RV PCR) tests assist in rapidly identifying viral pathogens and differentiating viral versus bacterial causes of pneumonia. Studies evaluating the use of RV PCR tests on antibiotic use in adults have demonstrated mixed results. We implemented an antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) intervention for patients with a positive RV PCR test result who were receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and aimed to assess the impact on antibiotic usage.; METHODS: Retrospective quasi-experimental study of adult hospitalized patients comparing time to antibiotic deescalation, duration of antibiotic therapy, and antiviral use preintervention (January-March 2016) and postintervention (January-March 2017).; RESULTS: Of 172 ASP alerts reviewed, 55 (32%) were considered actionable. Of these, 47% of interventions were accepted. No significant difference was observed in median time to antibiotic deescalation (pre: 2.7days vs post: 2.3days, p=0.88). Time to discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy pre- and postintervention was reduced from 4 to 1.9days (p=0.057) for piperacillin-tazobactam, from 2.7 to 1.8days (p=0.75) for ceftriaxone, and from 3.6 to 2days (p=0.4) for levofloxacin, respectively. Time to initiation of oseltamivir for influenza was significantly shorter in the postintervention group (pre: 11.3hrs vs post: 3.6hrs, p=0.02).; CONCLUSION: A third of patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics with a positive RV PCR had an opportunity for antimicrobial optimization, although this did not translate into a significant impact on the time to antibiotic deescalation or overall antibiotic use. Combination of RV PCR results with biomarkers to rule out bacterial coinfections and chest radiographic findings may help enhance the likelihood of accepted antibiotic deescalation recommendations and represents an area of future research. © 2019 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Persons with multiple sclerosis are increasingly treated with intermediate- or high-dose chemotherapy and a hematopoietic cell autotransplant. This is often done in an inpatient setting using frozen blood cell grafts.; OBJECTIVE: Determine if chemotherapy and a hematopoietic cell autotransplant can be safely done in an outpatient setting using refrigerated, non-frozen grafts.; METHODS: We developed an autotransplant protocol actionable in an outpatient setting using a refrigerated, non-frozen blood graft collected after giving cyclophosphamide, 50mg/kg/d*2days and filgrastim, 10mug/kg/d. A second identical course was given 9days later followed by infusion of blood cells stored at 4°C for 1-4days. The co-primary outcomes were rates of granulocyte and platelet recovery and therapy-related mortality.; RESULTS: We treated 426 consecutive subjects. Median age was 47years (range, 21-68years). A total of 145 (34%) were male. Median graft refrigeration time was 1day (range, 1-4days). Median interval to granulocytes >0.5*10E+9/L was 8days (range, 2-12) and to platelets >20*10E+9/L, 8days (range, 1-12). Only 15 subjects (4%) were hospitalized, predominately for iatrogenic pneumothorax (N=5) and neutropenic fever (N=4). There was only 1 early death from infection.; CONCLUSION: Intermediate-dose chemotherapy and a hematopoietic cell autotransplant can be safely done in an outpatient setting using, refrigerated, non-frozen grafts. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the assessment of a broader spectrum of non-oncological diseases, among adults, remains poorly studied. We assessed the utility of WES in the diagnosis and management of adults with unexplained liver disease despite comprehensive evaluation by a hepatologist and with no history of alcohol overuse.; METHODS: We performed WES and deep phenotyping of 19 unrelated adult patients with idiopathic liver disease recruited at a tertiary academic health care center in the US.; RESULTS: Analysis of the exome in 19 cases identified 4 monogenic disorders in 5 unrelated adults. Patient 1 suffered for 18 years from devastating complications of undiagnosed type 3 familial partial lipodystrophy due to a deleterious heterozygous variant in PPARG. Molecular diagnosis enabled initiation of leptin replacement therapy with subsequent normalization of liver aminotransferases, amelioration of dyslipidemia, and decreases in daily insulin requirements. Patients 2 and 3 were diagnosed with MDR3 deficiency due to recessive mutations in ABCB4. Patient 4 with a prior diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was found to harbor a mitochondrial disorder due to a homozygous pathogenic variant in NDUFB3; this finding enabled initiation of disease preventive measures including supplementation with antioxidants. Patient 5 is a lean patient with hepatic steatosis of unknown etiology who was found to have a damaging heterozygous variant in APOB.; CONCLUSIONS: Genomic analysis yielded an actionable diagnosis in a substantial number (25%) of selected adult patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. This study supports the use of WES in the evaluation and management of adults with idiopathic liver disease in clinical practice.; LAY SUMMARY: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 19 adult patients with unexplained liver disease after an unrevealing conventional work-up performed by a hepatologist. In 5 cases, genomic analysis led to a diagnosis and informed treatment and management of the disease. Therefore, we suggest using whole-exome sequencing in the evaluation and management of adults with unexplained liver disease. Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB BACKGROUND: The real-time generation of information about pathogen genomes has become a vital goal for transmission analysis and characterisation in rapid outbreak responses. In response to the recently established genomic capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we explored the real-time generation of genomic information at the start of the 2018 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu Province.; METHODS: We used targeted-enrichment sequencing to produce two coding-complete Ebola virus genomes 5 days after declaration of the EVD outbreak in North Kivu. Subsequent sequencing efforts yielded an additional 46 genomes. Genomic information was used to assess early transmission, medical countermeasures, and evolution of Ebola virus.; FINDINGS: The genomic information demonstrated that the EVD outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri Provinces was distinct from the 2018 EVD outbreak in Equateur Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Primer and probe mismatches to Ebola virus were identified in silico for all deployed diagnostic PCR assays, with the exception of the Cepheid GeneXpert GP assay.; INTERPRETATION: The first two coding-complete genomes provided actionable information in real-time for the deployment of the rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine, available therapeutics, and sequence-based diagnostic assays. Based on the mutations identified in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (GP12) observed in all 48 genomes, deployed monoclonal antibody therapeutics (mAb114 and ZMapp) should be efficacious against the circulating Ebola virus variant. Rapid Ebola virus genomic characterisation should be included in routine EVD outbreak response procedures to ascertain efficacy of medical countermeasures.; FUNDING: Defense Biological Product Assurance Office.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Residual cardiovascular disease risk and increasing metabolic syndrome risk underscores a need for novel therapeutics targeting lipid metabolism in humans. Unbiased human genetic screens have proven powerful in identifying novel genomic loci, and this review discusses recent developments in such discovery.; RECENT FINDINGS: Recent human genome-wide association studies have been completed in incredibly large, detailed cohorts, allowing for the identification of more than 300 genomic loci that participate in the regulation of plasma lipid metabolism. However, the discovery of these loci has greatly outpaced the elucidation of the underlying functional mechanisms. The identification of novel roles for long noncoding RNAs, such as CHROME, LeXis, and MeXis, in lipid metabolism suggests that noncoding RNAs should be included in the functional translation of GWAS loci.; SUMMARY: Unbiased genetic studies appear to have unearthed a great deal of novel biology with respect to lipid metabolism, yet translation of these findings into actionable mechanisms has been slow. Increased focus on the translation, rather than the discovery, of these loci, with new attention paid to lncRNAs, can help spur the development of novel therapeutics targeting lipid metabolism.

AB We developed and characterized a next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for streamlined analysis of DNA and RNA using low-input, low-quality cancer specimens. A single-workflow, targeted NGS panel for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was designed covering 135 RNA and 55 DNA disease-relevant targets. This multiomic panel was used to assess 219 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded NSCLC surgical resections and core needle biopsies. Mutations and expression phenotypes were identified consistent with previous large-scale genomic studies, including mutually exclusive DNA and RNA oncogenic driver events. Evaluation of a second cohort of low cell count fine-needle aspirate smears from the BATTLE-2 trial yielded 97% agreement with an independent, validated NGS panel that was used with matched surgical specimens. Collectively, our data indicate that broad, clinically actionable insights that previously required independent assays, workflows, and analyses to assess both DNA and RNA can be conjoined in a first-tier, highly multiplexed NGS test, thereby providing faster, simpler, and more economical results.

AB Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options and poor outcome. Twenty-nine primary resected SDC, including 15 SDC de novo (SDCDN), and 14 SDC ex pleomorphic adenoma (SDCXPA) were subjected to the massive parallel sequencing assay (MSK-IMPACT) targeting 287 to 468 cancer-related genes. TP53 was the most frequently altered gene (69%). TP53 mutations and ERBB2 amplification were more frequent in SDCXPA than in SDCDN (P = .0007 and P = .01, respectively). Potentially targetable mutations were detected in 79% (23/29) of SDC involving ERBB2 (31%), PIK3CA (28%), HRAS (21%), ALK (7%) and BRAF (3%), and 22% (5/23) of those cases harbored possible primary resistance mutations involving CCNE1, NF1 and PTEN. A novel HNRNPH3-ALK rearrangement was found in one SDCDN. In another case, EML4-ALK fusion detected in the primary tumor was associated with ALK G1202R secondary resistance mutation in the post-treatment metastasis. A germline analysis of the DNA repair genes revealed a case with a pathogenic BRCA1 E23fs germline variant. SDCDN and SDCXPA are genetically distinct. Although the majority of SDC may be amenable to molecular targeted therapy, concurrent possible resistance mutations may be found in a significant minority of cases. A broad genomic profiling is necessary to ensure detection of rare but clinically actionable somatic alterations in SDC. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Transgender (TG) people are individuals who experience an incongruity between their gender and the sex they were assigned at birth. Constituting 0.5%-2% of the population, TG individuals experience greater rates of discrimination, even in health care. Up to 23% of transgender people report having been refused basic medical care based on their gender identity, leading many to avoid seeking care. Familiarity of health care providers with TG issues and terminology has been shown to improve the experience of TG individuals in health care. This article aims to familiarize interventional radiologists with the TG community and provide actionable goals for creating an affirming, inclusive department. Copyright © 2018 SIR.

AB Diarrheal illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, yet the etiologic agent of many cases of gastrointestinal illness remains unspecified, often due to the lack of convenient, timely, and sensitive diagnostic testing. Although bulk fecal specimens remain the recommended specimen type for enteric culture, rectal swabs may be an option preferred by clinicians and patients due to the convenience and timing of collection. However, the lack of data evaluating the sensitivity of rectal swabs compared to fecal specimens for detection of enteric pathogens precludes this specimen type from being recommended by national guidelines. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 480 paired rectal swab and fecal specimens submitted for enteric culture to the Barnes-Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital microbiology laboratories in St. Louis, MO, from 2002 to 2017. We report 32% positivity of paired specimens with an overall agreement of 93% and Cohen's kappa of 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.89). Additionally, we evaluated the time to result from the time of patient presentation to the health care setting and demonstrate that rectal swabs have a significantly shorter time to an actionable result than bulk fecal specimens (median, 67.4h versus 78.4h, respectively; P<0.001). These findings indicate that rectal swabs facilitate on-demand culture-based testing with a sensitivity comparable to that of fecal specimens and thus should be recommended for enteric bacterial culture when bulk fecal specimens are unavailable.

AB Angiogenesis is critical to cancer development and metastasis. However, anti-angiogenic agents have only had modest therapeutic success, partly due to an incomplete understanding of tumor endothelial cell (EC) biology. We previously reported that the microRNA (miR)-200 family inhibits metastasis through regulation of tumor angiogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. Here, using integrated bioinformatics approaches, we identified the RNA-binding protein (RBP) quaking (QKI) as a leading miR-200b endothelial target with previously unappreciated roles in the tumor microenvironment in lung cancer. In lung cancer samples, both miR-200b suppression and QKI overexpression corresponded with tumor ECs relative to normal ECs, and QKI silencing phenocopied miR-200b-mediated inhibition of sprouting. Additionally, both cancer cell and endothelial QKI expression in patient samples significantly corresponded with poor survival and correlated with angiogenic indices. QKI supported EC function by stabilizing cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA to promote EC G1/S cell cycle transition and proliferation. Both nanoparticle-mediated RNA interference of endothelial QKI expression and palbociclib blockade of CCND1 function potently inhibited metastasis in concert with significant effects on tumor vasculature. Altogether, this work demonstrates the clinical relevance and therapeutic potential of a novel, actionable miR/RBP axis in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.

AB The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas ranks among the largest outbreaks in modern times. Like other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, ZIKV circulates in sylvatic cycles among primates that can serve as reservoirs of spillover infection to humans. Identifying sylvatic reservoirs is critical to mitigating spillover risk, but relevant surveillance and biological data remain limited for this and most other zoonoses. We confronted this data sparsity by combining a machine learning method, Bayesian multi-label learning, with a multiple imputation method on primate traits. The resulting models distinguished flavivirus-positive primates with 82% accuracy and suggest that species posing the greatest spillover risk are also among the best adapted to human habitations. Given pervasive data sparsity describing animal hosts, and the virtual guarantee of data sparsity in scenarios involving novel or emerging zoonoses, we show that computational methods can be useful in extracting actionable inference from available data to support improved epidemiological response and prevention.
