#### Overview:  
The purpose of this project is to investigate the provision of timely and effective outpatient and emergency department care in Pennsylvania. Using CMS “Timely and Effective Care” data set, the goals of the project are:  
+ To compare Pennsylvania to other states and national progress on emergency department access and care and display the results using interactive maps.  
+ To approximate service areas for major hospitals in Pennsylvania and determine if timely and effective care is available for for certain domains in emergency care, specifically: stroke interventions, heart attack interventions, wait time.
+ To investigate if there are any relationships between demographic variables and TEC using multivariable regressions.  


#### Introduction:  
According to the United Health Care Foundation’s report _America’s Health Rankings_ in 2015, Pennsylvania fell below national averages in rankings of state population health, ranking 29th among the 50 states. Furthermore, according to CDC data published in 2014, measures of health status in Pennsylvania vary by race/ethnicity, and patterns across these measures in Pennsylvania are similar to national data. Moreover, disparities in health and health access exist across the geographic regions of the state, with Pennsylvanians living in rural communities more likely to have unmet heath needs and have poor access to health care than those in urban communities. 

Access to health care means having "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes" (IOM, 1993). Timely and effective ambulatory care is an important cornerstone of healthcare access, and is essential for good patient outcomes and satisfaction. This is especially true in the US, where the cost of healthcare is high and ever increasing, but healthcare outcomes remain poor, especially for a developed nation. It is important that care not only be evidence-based and clinically indicated, but also timely and prompt, with delivery of the “right care at the right time.” 

Ambulatory care includes primary care, outpatient care and emergency room care. Ideally, patients are able to use primary care and outpatient for usual care, and only visit the ED for emergent conditions. Unfortunately, given the cost of healthcare and differential access to quality insurance, many patients use the ED as a ready alternative to their usual source of medical care. Many studies have examined the associations between perceived timely access barriers and reported use of the ED, which have shown that the benefits of usual medical care are often limited by barriers that limit effective and timely access to such care. Addressing these barriers first involves an identification of the ways in which timely and effective care is lacking.

This is an interdisciplinary issue, requiring the input of physicians, public health advocates, epidemiologists, economists, public service advocates, etc. As such, addressing the problem of timely access to care requires a multidisciplinary approach, and aim to employ one in this project to identify region-specific factors influencing access to care, or lack thereof. I thereby hope to provide critical insight into the state of healthcare in Pennsylvania.


#### Methods:
Using the Timely and Effective Care (TEC) data from CMS through 2020, I will compare Pennsylvania to other states and national progress on emergency department access and care. The TEC data set includes data for measures of cataract surgery outcome, colonoscopy follow-up, heart attack care, emergency department care, preventive care, pregnancy and delivery care, and cancer care. I will focus on some of the most general issues in emergency care -- interventions for stroke, interventions for myocardial infarctions (MI; heart attacks), and wait time for patients in the ED.

*First* I will generate graphs to visualize how TEC in Pennsylvania compares nationally. *Second*, I will compare TEC in Pennsylvania to its regional neighbors in the Northeast. *Next*, I will attempt to look at more granular data for Pennsylvania and compare within state access. The TEC data set contains hospital, state-level and national data but, unfortunately, does not contain county-level data. Using the hospital data, I will attempt to calculate service areas of emergency departments using ~2 mile radius of the ED hospital data, building in assumptions to build critical diversions and other necessary information. I will explain all assumptions made.

*Finally*, I will merge the state-level data with demographic data available in the US census data set, and, controlling for certain demographic characteristics, will run multivariate regressions to determine if there are any relationships that can be deduced from the data set and help explain differences in TEC. I will explain all assumptions made.

This project was supported by  Dr. Gary Weissman, MD, MSHP (Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Fellow Leonard Davies Institute) and Dr. John Holmes PhD, FACE, FACMI (Professor of Medical Informatics in Epidemiology, Associate Director of the Institute for Biomedical Informatics), who both provided invaluable advice and guidance for mapping the data and assumptions for service areas.

##### Visualizing national data  
First, national data is visualized using *us_states* dataset provided by the spData package. Note: 'total_pop_15' is the numerical vector of total population in 2015. For simplicity only the contiguous United States is considered.

Metrics investigated are:
+ OP_18b: Average (median) time patients spent in the ED  
+ OP_18c: Average (median) time patients spent in the ED (Psychiatric/Mental Health Patients)  
+ OP_2: Percentage of outpatients with chest pain or possible heart attack who got drugs to break up blood clots within 30 minutes of arrival  
+ OP_3b: Percentage of patients who came to the ED with stroke symptoms who received brain scan results within 45 minutes of arrival  
+ OP_23: Average (median) number of minutes before outpatients with chest pain or possible heart attack who needed specialized care were transferred to another hospital

##### Investigating Access to Hospitals

Next, I explore the availability of hospitals across Pennsylvania. I will map hospital densities using the hospital data from TEC. Using the package ggmap, I will get latitude and longitude data for each hospital address in the TEC data using the Google API. To do this, I registered for a free Google console account, generated an API key that I registered in R Studio, and enabled the following APIs on the Google Console:
+ Directions API  
+ Geocoding API  
+ Geolocation API  
+ Places API  
+ Maps Javascript AVI  
+ Maps Embed API  

I then converted the data frame of resultant cartesion coordinates to an sf object. I used the the projection WGS84, which is the CRS code #4326, a priori defined in the sf object. I mapped the hospitals onto a map of Pennsylvania using the counties dataset tigris library, overlayed with county population data.

```{r}
#Subset data to metrics of interest and PA
df_hosp <- tec_hosp %>% filter(Measure.ID %in% varlist & State=="PA")

#Get list of hospital names
df_hosp_fac <- df_hosp %>% 
   mutate(addr=paste0(Address,", ",City, ", ",State," ",ZIP.Code)) %>%
   distinct(Facility.Name,addr) %>% 
   arrange(Facility.Name)

df_hosp_fac$addr <- gsub('34TH ST &', '3400', df_hosp_fac$addr)
df_hosp_fac$addr <- gsub('34TH &', '3400', df_hosp_fac$addr)

#Getting map coordinates (lat and long) of hospital addresses 
for(i in 1:nrow(df_hosp_fac))
{
    ifelse(is.na(df_hosp_fac$addr[i]), NA,      
    hosp_ggmap_pa <- geocode(df_hosp_fac$addr[i], output = "more", source = "google", messaging = FALSE))
          df_hosp_fac$Longitude[i] <- as.numeric(hosp_ggmap_pa[1])
          df_hosp_fac$Latitude[i] <- as.numeric(hosp_ggmap_pa[2])

Next, I will break down this distribution of hospitals across a few key service lines, namely pediatric hospitals, trauma centers and stroke centers.

#### Discussion:  
As shown in the above maps, patients in Pennsylvania, on average, spend more time waiting in the ED than the national average (Figures 1 and 2). Additionally, patients who go to the ED with signs of a possible heart attack or stroke, on average, were received timely care less often (Figures 3 and 4). Patients with chest pain in PA had to wait longer before transfer to a specialty hospital than the US national average (Figure 5). 

Though PA underperforms nationally, the regional graphs shows that PA performs the second best in the Northeast region (behind Vermont) with respect to general ED wait time (Fig. 6), but on par with the region for timely care for acute life-threatening symptoms (chest pain, stroke symptoms, Fig. 7).
problem solving.
As expected, the largest number of hospitals are in the most densely populated states.



Limitations: 
1. Assumption that only pediatric hospitals see pediatric patients, which is not true. This underestimates access to pediatric care, but still exists as a proxy for access to high quality pediatric care.
