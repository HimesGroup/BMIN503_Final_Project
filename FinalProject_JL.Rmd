### Overview
> This project will examine the effect of COVID-19 cases, the vaccination rate, and their corresponding effects in the medical device industry. The stock price data for the Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, Boston Scientific, and Medtronic will be examined in this study and these are the top medical device company here in the United States. These four companies are mainly medical device company with few pharmaceutical Products. Johnson &Johnson has been excluded from this study to eliminate the effect due to its Covid- 19 vaccine products on its stock price.

>Dataset Used:
1.Stock Price: Yahoo Fiance (2020 - 2021)
2.COVID-19 cases Data: NYTimes and JHU dataset by states and counties(Kaggle) (2020 - 2021)
3.COVID-19 Vaccination Rate: NYTimes and JHU dataset by states (Kaggle) (2020 - 2021)


### Introduction 
>The final project will be focus on the effect of COVID 19 Vaccination rate here in the US with the medical device market performance.Due to COVID-19, some of the device sales has significantly decreased in the past year while some has little to no impact to their market share. Therefore, determine which catagory has the most signifcant impact that can provide the company with the most flexible to make strategic business change.

>As an Bioengineering student with strong interest in business and medical device, I think it is interesting to have a look about the impact of the COVID-19 Vaccine and its related impact to the device market as some of them has been significantly disrupted. Increasing vaccination rate will definitely change the current disruptive market and rapid and dynamic change will be important for companies to succeed in post-COVID period.

>It is significant for the company to dynamiclly monitor the market and make changes to their business plan to maxmize their profits. This will be an interdisciplinary research with focus in both bioinformatics and business field. Some market analysis, knowledge from medical device, and bioinfomatics knowledge will be a plus in this scenario.

### Methods

##Data Loading

##Data Cleaning

##Data Visualization
> The data will be visualized in this section to get a general view of the data and the corresponding trend in 2020 and 2021 and make general assumption based on the results

##Regression 
> Linear and random frost with cross validation will be performed here to detemine the relationship between the covid 19 cases, covid 19 vaccination rate, and the stock price for the four companies listed above. Time series will also be used in this case. RMSE and AUC will also be calculated to ensure accuracy and the most accurate model will be adopted for prediction. (If data is available, still searching, the empty bed in united states data will also take into consideration)

## Prediction
> Predict the stock price trend based on COVID 19 Cases and COVID19 Vaccination rate. (details will be updated soon after consulting with friends in Business Analysis program)


### Results
> demographic graphs and other graphs are expected to be shown here
> Expect to see the company with products less related to impatient care receive relative little impact towards their stock price.
