# Overview

For my final project, I am looking at trends in the case counts and rates of [infectious diseases reported in California](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/infectious-diseases-by-disease-county-year-and-sex-d8912) from 2001 to 2021. California regulations require cases of [selected communicable diseases](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ReportableDiseases.pdf) to be reported (PDF) to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH); CDPH work with and local health departments to monitor cases and to identify, control, and prevent infections. I want to see if there is a increase in the number of diseases in the past two decades and more specifically identify which disease is becoming more frequent; I'd like to look at the spatial distribution of the diseases as well to identify potential hot spots. I spoke with two DBEI faculties (Quy Cao and Haochang Shou), as well as my coworker who is a wonderful data analyst. They provided valuable feedback on what to include and data visualizations, as well as asking questions that helped me dive a bit deeper into the dataset (e.g., doing more research on the diseases, identifying potential reasons for increasing cases, and etc).

# Introduction

For some brief background, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) maintains a passive reporting system for a list of communicable disease cases and outbreaks mandated by state law and regulation. A full list of selected communicable diseases can be found [here](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ReportableDiseases.pdf). Healthcare providers are required to report cases of these diseases to local health departments, which in turn report these cases to the CDPH. Tracking and monitor these diseases is very important because it helps us understand the magnitude and burden of specific diseases, quickly identify disease outbreaks, and also help us identify potential risk groups which we can then design targeted intervention strategies and actions, as well as assessing the effectiveness of any control or prevention efforts.

In simple words, surveillance is a fundamental bedrock of public health. Usually when everything is normal and nothing bad happens, the public is unaware of the public surveillance that is occuring in the background. Only when there is a big outbreak will the public then realize the importance of active disease monitoring. Public health surveillance is itself a really interdisciplinary team effort - first you need providers and laboratories reporting these cases to local health departments, which is potentially followed by fieldwork to examine and identify sources of outbreaks, then the Department of Health aggregates these information across regions and entire data analyst teams are dedicated to cleaning and extracting valuable information from the data to identify potential risk factors and inform future prevention planning. This final data project is a great way for me to get some hands-on practice on a actual surveillance dataset to extract patterns and see how data and evidence-based approaches can help us allocate resources to who needs them the most.

# Methods

First, for exploratory analysis, I aggregated data across all years (2001 - 2021) for each reported disease and identified the top 10 diseases by cumulative case count. Next, I looked at the trend more closely year by year for the top 3 reportable communicable diseases to see if there has been a drastic decrease or increase in cases over the years. General trends for the diseases are described and possible explanations for the trends are provided when relevant, along with a brief overview of each disease. Next, I looked at the spatial distribution for each disease to identify which region or population are affected more using choropleth maps. All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1.

### Campylobacteriosis

*Campylobacter* is the #1 cause of bacterial diarrheal illness in the United States. CDC estimates 1.5 million illnesses each year in the US. People usually get infected by eating raw or undercooked poultry. Common symptoms include diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps, and also nausea/vomiting. Symptoms usually start 2-5 days after person ingests *Campylobacter* and last about one week. Fortunately, most people recover without antibiotic treatment. However, those at risk for severe illnesses might need antibiotic treatment (i.e., 65+, pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems). 

```{r}
# find the number of cases and incidence rate for each disease, at each year
diseases <- infectious_data %>% 
  filter(county == "California") %>% #state level data
  filter(sex == "Total") %>% #across all cases 
  mutate(rate = (cases *100000)/population) %>% #calculate the rate
  #mutate(rate = as.numeric(rate)) %>%  #convert rate to numeric
  #filter(cases > 0) %>% 
  select(disease, year, cases, rate) 

# Create a bar plot for Campylobacteriosis cases
diseases %>% filter(disease == "Campylobacteriosis") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#66c2a5") +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(cases)), nudge_y = 150, size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = "Campylobacteriosis Cases by Year", x = "Year", y = "Number of Cases") +
  theme_bw()

# bar plot of incidence rates
diseases %>% filter(disease == "Campylobacteriosis") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#66c2a5") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(rate,1)), nudge_y = 0.4, size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = "Campylobacteriosis Incidence Rate by Year", x = "Year", y = "Rate (# cases/100K population") +
  theme_bw()
```

::: callout-tip
## Findings
From the case and incidence rates trends above, we see that the number of people who get sick from the *Campylobacter* bacteria has been increasing steadily since 2006. In fact, the # of cases have more than doubled from 2006 (4631 cases) to 2019 (10022 cases). The significant drop observed in year 2020 is likely impacted by COVID, an timepoint at which most health resources are divested toward controlling the new SARs-Cov2 Virus. Another reason why we see this drop is people eating out less so there are fewer food-related outbreaks.
:::

### Salmonellosis

Salmonellosis is an infection with a bacteria called *Salmonella*, which usually live in the intestinal tracts of animals. Salmonella are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Contaminated foods are often of animal origin (e.g., poultry, pork, poultry, etc). Common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, and fever.

```{r}
disease_of_interest <- "Salmonellosis"

diseases %>% filter(disease == disease_of_interest) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#fc8d62") +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(cases)), nudge_y = 100, size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = paste0(disease_of_interest, " Cases by Year"), x = "Year", y = "Number of Cases") +
  theme_bw()

diseases %>% filter(disease == disease_of_interest) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#fc8d62") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(rate,1)), nudge_y = 0.3, size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = paste0(disease_of_interest, " Incidence Rate by Year"), x = "Year", y = "Rate (# cases/100K population") +
  theme_bw()
```

::: callout-tip
## Findings
The incidence rate of Salmonellosis is more stable compared to that for Campylobacteriosis; the incidence rate have fluctuated between 10 to 16 cases per 100K population. Again, note the drastic decrease in Salmonellosis due to COVID-19. 
:::

### Coccidioidomycosis

Cocci or Valley fever is a disease caused by a fungus that grows in the soil and dirt in some areas of California and southwestern US. People get sick when they breathe in dust that contains Valley fever fungus. Valley fever can be serious and fatal. Currently there is no vaccine to prevent cocci but antifungals medications are available.

```{r}
disease_of_interest <- "Coccidioidomycosis"

diseases %>% filter(disease == disease_of_interest) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#8da0cb") +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(cases)), nudge_y = 150, size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = paste0(disease_of_interest, " Cases by Year"), x = "Year", y = "Number of Cases") +
  theme_bw()

diseases %>% filter(disease == disease_of_interest) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#8da0cb") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(rate,1)), nudge_y = 0.4, size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = paste0(disease_of_interest, " Incidence Rate by Year"), x = "Year", y = "Rate (# cases/100K population") +
  theme_bw()
```

::: callout-tip
## Findings
The number of cases and incidence rate of Valley Fever have increased drastically over the years. The incidence rate is only 4.3 cases (per 100K population) in 2001 but increased to more than than 22.9 in 2019. Note that the drop in cases in 2020 is not as drastic as compared to the other two diseases. Because Coccidioidomycosis usually affect those who work in the field and farming is still an essential activity despite of the pandemic, field workers are likely to be still working and thus at risk of Cocci infection.

# Discussion
For this study, I conducted a brief epidemiologic examination of selected communicable diseases in the state of California. Using publicly available data from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), I looked at the top 3 reportable communicable diseases by cumulative case count within the years 2001-2021 and examined the annual trends. The top two disease, Campylobacteriosis and Salmonellosis, are both bacterial infections, usually via contact with raw/undercooked food or foods contaminated with the bacteria. To mitigate foodborne disease infection and outbreaks in the future, we need to prevent contamination during the processing and production of foods. In addition, to prevent outbreaks in the long term, we need to implement food safety practices and work with partners throughout the food production chain. As with any other public health issue, it is also important to educate people about food safety practices such as washing hands thoroughly before preparing or eating food, after using the toilet, etc. Geographically, food-borne outbreaks are more frequent in more populous areas such as San Francisco. This could be an artifact of health resource availability. For instance, many smaller and rural hospitals might not have the resources to conduct and report cultures studies for these diseases; many infections might go untested and unreportabled in less populated locations. Thus, to have more reliability surveillance, there is a need to strengthen surveillance systems across the state in the future. 

Unlike the first two bacterial diseases, the 3rd disease Coccidioidomycosis (or Valley Fever) is a fungal infection caused by inhalation of a fungus that grows in the soil and dirt. Valley Fever infections is most common is some areas of California and southwestern US such as Arizona. Because valley fever can be serious and fatal, proactive prevention strategies are needed. Currently there is no vaccine to prevent the disease but antifungal medications are available. In California, most cases are reported in people who live in the Central Valley and Central Coast regions. Central Valley is known for its agricultural productivity, in fact, it provides more than half of fruits,vegetables, and nuts grown in the US. Those at higher risk of infection include people participate in outdoor activities that involve close contact with dirt or dust, including construction and farming. To reduce the likelihood of infection for these populations, we need to promote activities such as wetting down soil before disturbing to reduce dust or wearing an N95 mask or respirator. Education campaigns will also be very helpful to raise awareness of the disease. 

To conclude, this project was a great exercise for me to use an actual surveillance dataset to extract patterns and see how data can be used to inform decision-making. Through the exercise, I also realized the importance of tracking and monitoring of communicable diseases - understanding the magnitude and burden of specific diseases informs allocation of resources and helps identify potential risk groups. Having surveillance data available helps us design targeted intervention strategies and also assess the effectiveness of control or prevention efforts. With increasing globalization and climate change, we will likely experience more spill-over events in the future so having a active and strong surveillance system is vitally important in detecting new cases and outbreaks. **Surveillance is a fundamental bedrock of public health! **
