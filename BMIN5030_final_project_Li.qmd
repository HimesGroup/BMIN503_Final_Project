### Overview

Season influenza viruses continues to be a major global burden. There are around a billion cases annually and up to 650,000 people die of influenza. Influenza activity patterns vary geographically and temporally, so we want to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity in the United States and determine if variations in influenza activities across states or regions are associated with distribution of circulating virus strains. I will be using surveillance data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and viral sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GIDSAID) to answer these questions. Understanding patterns of seasonal influenza activity can help guide early influenza surveillance and inform influenza prevention and control programs. Materials for this project can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/graceshli/BMIN503_Final_Project).


### Introduction

Influenza has a large seasonal burden in the United States: up to 35 million people are infected annually causing between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths. In the U.S., flu season typically starts on the 40th week of the year (1st week of October), but influenza activity including time of onset, duration, and number of peaks varies greatly across the states.

The CDC routinely publishes weekly reports of influenza surveillance data providing a national picture of influenza virus activities in the U.S. One aspect of these surveillance is performed by clinical laboratories across the country determining the percentage of specimens positive for influenza virus. These test results allow us to evaluate if influenza cases are increasing or decreasing. Efforts by public health laboratories to sequence influenza genomes have also allowed researchers to study sequences of influenza viruses using databases like GISAID. By linking regional epidemiologic data to circulating influenza sequencing data, we hope to identify patterns of clade distribution associated with influenza activities in the U.S. An understanding of the spatial and temporal spread of influenza can help inform public health decisions in influenza prevention and control.

### Methods

Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.
