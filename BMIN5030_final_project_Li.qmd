### Overview

Season influenza viruses continues to be a major global burden. There are around a billion cases annually and up to 650,000 people die of influenza. Influenza activity patterns vary geographically and temporally, so we want to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity in the United States and determine if variations in influenza activities across states or regions are associated with distribution of circulating virus strains. I will be using surveillance data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and viral sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GIDSAID) to answer these questions. Understanding patterns of seasonal influenza activity can help guide early influenza surveillance and inform influenza prevention and control programs. Materials for this project can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/graceshli/BMIN503_Final_Project).

### Introduction

Influenza has a large seasonal burden in the United States: up to 35 million people are infected annually causing between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths. In the U.S., flu season typically starts on the 40th week of the year (1st week of October), but influenza activity including time of onset, duration, and number of peaks varies greatly across the states.

The CDC routinely publishes weekly reports of influenza surveillance data providing a national picture of influenza virus activities in the U.S. One aspect of these surveillance is performed by clinical laboratories across the country determining the percentage of specimens positive for influenza virus. These test results allow us to evaluate if influenza cases are increasing or decreasing. Efforts by public health laboratories to sequence influenza genomes have also allowed researchers to study sequences of influenza viruses using databases like GISAID. By linking regional epidemiologic data to circulating influenza sequencing data, we hope to identify patterns of clade distribution associated with influenza activities in the U.S. An understanding of the spatial and temporal spread of influenza can help inform public health decisions in influenza prevention and control.

*Influenza surveillance*

We obtained influenza surveillance data from the CDC Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report. Viral surveillance from approximately 300 clinical laboratories in the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Laboratories System and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) is reported weekly and data can be accessed through FluView Interactive.

For this project, I downloaded data from all 50 states starting from the 2010-11 season. Data from clinical laboratories include the weekly total number of specimens tested, the number of positive influenza tests, and the percent positive by influenza type.

*GISAID*

GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, is a global database that provides access to genomic data of influenza viruses and other pathogens including coronaviruses and poxvirus. Add more here!

Within the EpiFlu database in GISAID, I searched for human influenza A and influenza B viruse isolates collected in the United States from October 2010 to October 2019. I further filtered isolate selection by requiring the isolate to contain complete sequences of both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase segment and not been passaged in cells or eggs. I downloaded the virus metadata that contains information including isolate name, subtype, and clade.

#### Download and clean data

First, we will download the weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report. Data collection from both the U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System and NREVSS began during the 1997-98 season. The total number of respiratory specimens tested and %positive rate for influenza are reported weekly.

```{r}
#| label: load_clinical_labs_surveillance data

# Load WHO/NREVSS surveillance data from clinical labs
clinical_labs <- read_csv("WHO_NREVSS_Clinical_Labs.csv")
```

Next, I will clean the surveillance data by removing unused variables and renaming variables. Influenza season typically starts on week 40 (first week of October), so I will include a variable named "ordered_week" that arrange weeks starting with week 40.

```{r}
#| label: organize_CDC_file

# Rename variables and order week variable
clinical_labs <- clinical_labs |>
        dplyr::select(-c("REGION TYPE")) |>
        dplyr::rename(state = REGION, 
               year = YEAR,
               week = WEEK,
               total_specimens = `TOTAL SPECIMENS`, 
               total_A = `TOTAL A`,
               total_B = `TOTAL B`,
               percent_positive = `PERCENT POSITIVE`,
               percent_A = `PERCENT A`,
               percent_B = `PERCENT B`) |> 
        mutate(ordered_week = (week - 40) %% 52 + 1) |>
        mutate(season = ifelse(week >= 40, year, year - 1)) |>
        mutate(ordered_week = as.factor(ordered_week)) |>
        mutate(percent_positive = as.numeric(percent_positive))
```

Since I will be drawing maps, I will retrieve shapefile for all states using tigris() and obtain information on states using the R Datasets Package.

```{r}
#| label: retrieve_state_info

# Retrieve shapefile for all states using tigirs() 
states <- states()

# Obtain state information on names and division using the package datasets
states_division <- data.frame(NAME = datasets::state.name, 
                              division = datasets::state.division)

# Merge shapefile with state information 
states <- inner_join(states, states_division, by = "NAME") |>
            rename(state = NAME)
```

Now I will merge the shapefile data frame with surveillance data.

```{r}
#| label: combine_surveillance_state_df

# Include state division info in clinical_labs df  
clinical_labs <- inner_join(states, clinical_labs, by = "state")

```

Finally, I am going to download influenza sequencing data from GISAID.

```{r}
#| label: GISAID_data

# Load data for influenza A and influenza B viruses
gisaid_a <- read_csv("gisaid_epiflu_isolates_fluA.csv")
gisaid_b <- read_csv("gisaid_epiflu_isolates_fluB.csv")

# Combine data for influenza A and influenza B viruses
gisaid <- bind_rows(gisaid_a, gisaid_b)

# Select relevant variables and rename variables
gisaid <- gisaid |>
            dplyr::select(c("Isolate_Id", "Isolate_Name", 
                            "Subtype", "Clade", "Collection_Date")) |>
            rename(id = Isolate_Id, 
                   name = Isolate_Name,
                   subtype = Subtype,
                   clade = Clade,
                   collection_date = Collection_Date) 

# Convert 'collection_date' to Date format
gisaid$collection_date <- as.Date(gisaid$collection_date)

# Create a new column 'week' indicating the week of the year
gisaid$week <- week(gisaid$collection_date)

# Create a new column 'season' indicating the flu season from which the isolate was sequenced
gisaid$season <- ifelse(gisaid$week >= 40, year(gisaid$collection_date), 
                        year(gisaid$collection_date) - 1)

# Create a new column 'ordered_week' for graphing and convert 'ordered_week' to numeric type
gisaid <- gisaid |>
            mutate(ordered_week = (week - 40) %% 52 + 1) |>
            mutate(ordered_week = as.numeric(ordered_week))
# Create a new column 'state' to indicate where the virus isolate came from
gisaid <- gisaid |>
  mutate(state = sapply(strsplit(as.character(name), "/"), `[`, 2))

head(gisaid)

```

Next we will clean up the GISAID dataset.

```{r}
#| label: GISAID_data_cleanup

# Remove rows where 'subtype' is "A", "A / H1N2", or "A / H3" (incomplete sequencing)
gisaid <- gisaid |> 
            filter(!(subtype %in% c("A", "A / H1N2", "A / H3")))

# Remove rows where 'clade' or 'collection_date' is NA or if clade is unassigned
gisaid <- gisaid |>
            filter(!is.na(clade) & !is.na(collection_date)) |>
            filter(!(clade %in% c("unassigned")))

# Define a vector containing the names of all 50 states
states_list <- c(
  "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado",
  "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho",
  "Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maine",
  "Maryland", "Massachusetts", "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Mississippi",
  "Missouri", "Montana", "Nebraska", "Nevada", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey",
  "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", "North Dakota", "Ohio", "Oklahoma",
  "Oregon", "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", "South Carolina", "South Dakota",
  "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont", "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia",
  "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"
)

# Keep only rows where the "state" column matches any state in the 50 states (exclude entries like New Yock City or District of Columbia)
gisaid <- gisaid |>
            filter(state %in% states_list)

head(gisaid)

```

### Results

#### Exploratory data analysis

I will start with some exploratory data analysis by looking at the CDC surveillance data in the 2017-18 flu season.

```{r}
#| label: drawing_map

# Filter data from the 2017-18 season 
season2017 <- clinical_labs |>
                filter(season == "2017")

# Set up theme for graphing maps 
my_theme <- function() {
  theme_minimal() +                                  
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),                 
        axis.text = element_blank(),                 
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "white"),  
        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm"),          
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8),       
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12))      
}

# Create a color palette function
myPalette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "YlOrRd"))

# Function to create a single map for a given week
create_weekly_map <- function(week_data) {
  
  weekly_map <- week_data |> 
    st_simplify() |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = percent_positive)) + 
    my_theme() +
    labs(title = paste("Week", unique(week_data$week))) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(name = "% Positive", colours = myPalette(100),
                         limit = range(0, 70))
}

# Create a list to store individual plots
season2017_map_list <- list()

# Create plots for each week
unique_week <- unique(season2017$week)

for (i in unique_week) {
  # Filter data for the specific week and shift geometry
  week_data <- season2017 |> 
    filter(week == i) |>
    shift_geometry()
  
  # Create a weekly map and add it to the list
  weekly_map <- create_weekly_map(week_data)
  
  season2017_map_list[[length(season2017_map_list) + 1]] <- weekly_map
}

```

```{r, animation.hook='gifski'}
#| label: percent_positive_map

# Create animation using gifski()
for (i in seq_along(season2017_map_list)) {
  print(season2017_map_list[[i]])
}

```

Overall, we can see that the timing and duration of flu seasons varied in different parts of the country. In some states, flu season began as early as October and November while some states had a later start but continued to have flu circulation until May. We can also see some of the potential issues we might run into using the CDC FluView data. For example, surveillance data is incomplete for some of the states or even completely absent in several states, and this problem is consistent across flu seasons. This is both an artifact of how I selected the surveillance data and the overall surveillance system in the United States.

Next let's take a closer look of the CDC surveillance data by state.

```{r}
#| label: 2017_season_percent_positive

# Percent positive cases in 2017-18 season 
season2017 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ordered_week, y = percent_positive, fill = division)) +
        facet_wrap(~ state, nrow = 5, ncol = 10) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "GnBu") +
        scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1, 14, 27, 40, 52), labels = c(40, 1, 14, 27, 39)) +
        scale_y_continuous() +
        labs(x = "Week", y = "Percent Positive", title = "2017-18 Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC") +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none",
              strip.background = element_blank(),
              panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA))

```

It is clear that influenza activity varied greatly across states in the 2017-18 season. States like Nevada had pretty early influenza detection whereas some states did not experience peak flu activity until later. Flu activity remained elevated in the spring in some regions such as the East North Central states. In addition, some states have longer flu season than others and some experienced several waves of influenza activity.

The U.S. Census Bureau has grouped the 50 states and the District of Columbia into nine divisions based on geographic proximity. I will also look at the surveillance data within each division to see if states in close proximity might exhibit similar flu activity patterns.

```{r}
#| label: 2017_season_percent_positive_division

# Get unique divisions
unique_divisions <- unique(season2017$division)

# Create a list to store individual plots
season2017_plot_list <- list()

# Create plots for each division
for (i in unique_divisions) {
        
  division_data <- season2017 |> 
          filter(division == i)
  
  p <- ggplot(division_data, aes(x = ordered_week, y = percent_positive, fill = state)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    facet_wrap(~ state, ncol = 4, nrow = 2, scales = "free") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Zissou1", n = 8, type = "continuous")) +
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1, 14, 27, 40, 52), labels = c(40, 1, 14, 27, 39)) +
    scale_y_continuous() +
    ylim(0, 66) +
    labs(x = "Week", y = "Percent Positive", title = i) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          strip.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA),
          aspect.ratio = 1)
 season2017_plot_list[[length(season2017_plot_list) + 1]] <- p
}

print(season2017_plot_list)

```

In some divisions, flu activity was very similar between states. For example, New York and Pennsylvania had similar pattern of flu activities, peaking around week 5. East North Central states also had relatively homogenous flu activity.

In contrast, states in the Mountain/West region had pretty distinct patterns. Nevada was one of the first states to start the 2017-18 flu season but flu activity did not start until later in the year in Utah. Interestingly, Idaho experienced two waves of influenza activity.

```{r}
#| label: 2017_season_percent_positive_pacific

# Percent positive cases in 2017-18 season in Mountain
season2017 |>
        filter(division == "Mountain") |>
        ggplot(aes(x = ordered_week, y = percent_positive, fill = state)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        facet_wrap(~ state) +
        scale_fill_manual(values = c('#855C75', '#D9AF6B', '#AF6458', '#736F4C', '#526A83', '#625377', '#68855C', 'deepskyblue4')) +
        scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1, 14, 27, 40, 52), labels = c(40, 1, 14, 27, 39)) +
        scale_y_continuous() +
        labs(x = "Week", y = "Percent Positive", title = "2017-18 Mountain Influenza Activity") +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none",
              strip.background = element_blank(),
              panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA))

# Percent positive cases in 2017-18 season in Idaho
season2017 |>
        filter(state == "Idaho") |>
        ggplot(aes(x = ordered_week, y = percent_positive, fill = division)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        scale_fill_manual(values = "#AF6458") +
        scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:52, labels = c(40:52, 1:39)) +
        scale_y_continuous() +
        labs(x = "Week", y = "Percent Positive", 
             title = "2017-18 Idaho Influenza Positive Tests") +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Now let's take a look at the influenza sequencing data retrieved from GISAID.

```{r}
#| label: gisaid_summary

# Group by 'subtype' and count the occurrences of each subtype
gisaid |>
  group_by(subtype) |>
  count()

# Create a table summary by 'state'
gisaid |> 
  select(-c(id, name, collection_date, week, clade, ordered_week, season)) |> 
  tbl_summary(by = state)

# Create a table summary by 'season'
gisaid |> 
  select(-c(id, name, collection_date, week, clade, ordered_week, state)) |> 
  tbl_summary(by = season)


```

From the summaries, we can see that we have more influenza A sequences than influenza B sequences in the United States between 2010 to 2019, which is consistent with influenza circulation pattern since influenza A is more common overall. Similar to the issue we encountered with the surveillance data, we will also have varied numbers of isolate sequences from state to state depending on the number of laboratories and resources allocated for influenza genome sequencing. My selection criteria might have also introduced bias in sampling. Finally, if we break it down by seasons, we can see that we have more sequencing data from 2015 to 2018, so I will focus my analysis on those flu seasons.


#### Duration of flu season and clade distribution

I want to start by determining which states had the longest/shortest flu season for every season between 2015 and 2018. To calculate this, I am counting the number of weeks where more than 10% of specimens tested are positive for influenza virus for each state.

```{r}
# | label: flu_season_duration

# Define the season of interest
seasons <- 2015:2018

# Extract relevant columns from clinical_labs and convert to dataframe
clinical_labs_1 <- clinical_labs |>
                      select(week, state, year, percent_positive, ordered_week)
                      
clinical_labs_1 <- as.data.frame(clinical_labs_1)

# Initialize an empty data frame to store flu season duration results
flu_duration <- data.frame()  

# Iterate over each season to find states with maximum and minimum flu season durations
for (season in seasons) {
  
  # Filter and summarize data for each state in the current season
  season_data <- clinical_labs_1 |>
    filter(!is.na(percent_positive)) |>
    group_by(state) |>
    summarize(flu_season_duration = sum(percent_positive > 10, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  # Find the state with the maximum flu season duration
  max_duration_state <- season_data |>
    filter(flu_season_duration == max(flu_season_duration, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
    select(state)
  
  # Find the state with the minimum flu season duration
  min_duration_state <- season_data |>
    filter(flu_season_duration == min(flu_season_duration, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
    select(state)

  # Append results to the flu_duration data frame
  flu_duration <- bind_rows(flu_duration, 
                            data.frame(Season = season, 
                                       Max_State = max_duration_state$state, 
                                       Min_State = min_duration_state$state))
}

flu_duration
```

However, due to unequal sampling between states in each season, I want to make sure that the number of missing values is not biasing our calculation above in finding the state with the longest/shortest duration of flu activity. Therefore, I am also calculating the ratio of weeks with percent_positive > 10 to the total number of weeks with non-missing values in order to account for the proportion of available data rather than just the count of weeks meeting the condition. 

```{r}
# | label: flu_season_duration_ratio

# Initialize an empty data frame to store flu season duration ratio results
flu_duration_ratio <- data.frame()

# Iterate over each season to find states with maximum and minimum flu season duration ratios
for (season in seasons) {
  
  # Filter and summarize data for each state in the current season
  season_data <- clinical_labs_1 %>%
    filter(season == season) %>%
    group_by(state) %>%
    summarize(
      total_weeks = sum(!is.na(percent_positive)),
      flu_season_duration = sum(percent_positive > 10, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    mutate(ratio = flu_season_duration / total_weeks)
  
  # Find the state with the maximum flu season duration ratio
  max_ratio_state <- season_data %>%
    filter(ratio == max(ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    select(state)
  
  # Find the state with the minimum flu season duration ratio
  min_ratio_state <- season_data %>%
    filter(ratio == min(ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    select(state)
  
  flu_duration_ratio <- bind_rows(flu_duration_ratio, 
                                  data.frame(Season = season, 
                                             Max_State = max_ratio_state$state, 
                                             Min_State = min_ratio_state$state))
}

flu_duration_ratio
```

I am still working on the code below.

```{r}
#| label: stacked_area_chart

create_stacked_area_chart <- function(season_data) {
  
  stacked_area_chart <- season_data |>

                          geom_area(stat = "count", position = "fill",
