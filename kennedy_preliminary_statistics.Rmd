# Purpose
This document aligns with the preliminary analysis section in the main analysis rmd file. Although I did not eliminate any values based on univariable analysis, I did run them for all variables of interest using Chi-squared tests and univariable logistic regression models comparing categorized to dichotomized results where applicable. Those results are included below, starting with chi-squared tests.

# Univariable Analysis Pre-Dichotomization

## Chi Squared Tests
Chi-Squared Tests of Variables (Pre-Dichotomization) to look at univariable relationship between clinically important predictors and 30-day readmissions. Significant variables included  

**Categorical/continuous variables**  

* Admission type (p=0.019)
* Discharge categories (p<0.001)
* Insurance (p=0.02)
* Ethnicity (p<0.001)
* Elixhauser comorbidities (p<0.001)
* LOS (p<0.001)

  
**Dichotomized variables**  

* Admission type (p=0.006)
* Discharge Disposition (p<0.001)
* Insurance (p=0.01)
* Ethnicity (p=0.004)
* Surgical vs non.surgical (p=0.03)
* Elixhauser comorbidities (p<0.001)
* LOS (p<0.001)

# Age

## Univariable Logistic Regression
Univariable Logistic Regression between clinically important predictors and readmissions. 

**Categorical/continuous variables**  

* Admission type: Emergency (p=0.005)
* LOS (p<0.001)


**Dichotomized variables**  

* Admission type: Emergency/Urgent (p<0.001)
* Discharge Disposition: Non-Home (p<0.001)
* Insurance: Public (p=0.004)
* Ethnicity: Non-white (p=0.004)
* Surgical vs non.surgical (p=0.02)
* Elixhauser comorbidities: 1 or more (p<0.001)
* LOS (p<0.001)
