### Overview
  Medically unnecessary Cesarean sections (C-sections) are associated with poor health outcomes for mother and baby. This project will explore several social predictors of C-sections.
  
  For this project, I conferred with Dr. Shimrit Keddem, PI at the Center for Health Equity, Research, and Promotion; she has used the NSFG in previous publications, and familiarized me with the National Survey of Family Growth which is a freely accessible dataset from the CDC to analyze my outcome. Dr. Keddem also helped me identify the revelant social predictors to explore this topic. Dr. Allison Curry, PI at the Center for Injury Research and Prevention helped me gather the background data on this topic and identify critical gaps in the literature. Finally, Professor Jessica Rast, STATA instructor and PhD Epidemiology candidate at Drexel University, taught me how to import the data into STATA so that it could then be imported into R.

### Introduction 
   In 2020, about 26% of births in the United States ended in Cesarean delivery.[1] As C-section rates continue to rise in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services announced one of the Healthy People 2030’s goals to reduce C-section rates among low-risk first births.[2] Compared to vaginal births, C-sections pose greater risks of complications at birth,[3] the postpartum period,[4] and negative long-term health outcomes.[5] These complications translate into high health care costs for patients, hospitals, and health insurance providers and diminished levels of maternal and infant health.[6–9]
  
  
   The issue of rising rates of medically unneccessary C-sections requires an interdisciplinary approach. The goal of public healh is to prevent negative healh outcomes. Healh care providers, government officials, insurance companies, and hospital systems all share this goal. Additionally, they share another goal which is to reduce unneccessary medical costs. An economic and policy analysis contribute to the understanding of this insidious trend. 

### Methods
  I will use the National Survey of Family Growth's (NSFG) 2017-2019 Female Pregnancy file for this analysis. The Female Pregnancy file is a subset of the NSFG that contains all relevant variables related to pregnancy and birth. The NSFG is a cross-sectional, nationally representative study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the purposes of this analysis, the analytic sample only includes first-births. The independent variables are prenatal care, age, insurance status, race/ethnicity, and smoking status during pregnancy. The dependent variable is C-section. Logistic regression will be used to explore the relationship between these social predictors and C-section.
  
   As of today, the NSFG does not have downloadable files available for use in RStudio; nevertheless, the data were imported into R by creating a .dta outfile in STATA and then read into R through the appropriate "Import Dataset" feature. Using the *write.csv* command, the data were saved to R.
   
   To clean this dataset, I am filtering the dataset by first pregnancy. The literature shows that the strongest predictor of C-section is having a previous C-section. By excluding all pregnancies but the first, I am eliminating a known confounder. I am also excluding any birth that resulted in twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc. because those pregnancies and births have additional risks outside the scope of this project. I am also defining my outcome variable as "c-section vs. vaginal birth" using the variable: *PREGEND1* (transformed into *birth.outcome*). The question asks each respondent: "How Pregnancy Ended - 1st mention". 
   
   I will perform logistic regression to compare odds of having a c-section vs. a vaginal birth; therefore, I excluded all other pregnancy outcomes. The social predictors I am including in this analysis are: maternal age, number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy, race, Hispanic origin, prenatal care, and insurance status.

```{r}
# packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gtsummary)
library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)
```


``` {r, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(nsfg, file = "nsfg.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

There is a typo in the upload of 2017-2019 data which says this is the 2015-2017 NSFG, but each observation has a "Calendar year when interview occurred" (intvwyear) variable and all observations occurred within the stated 2017-2019 study period. I also contacted the NCHS, and I was reaffirmed that it was a mistype on their end.
``` {r}
# clean the original nsfg file


library(dplyr)
# save datafile in a way that R will save it when it's time to knit
nsfg <- read.csv("nsfg.csv")

# WGT2017_2019: Final weight for the 2017-2019 NSFG; Applicable for all Respondents
# secu: Randomized version of the sampling error computational unit; : Applicable for all pregnancies (respondent-level variable)
# sest: Randomized version of the stratum; Applicable for all pregnancies (respondent-level variable)


clean_nsfg <- nsfg %>% #### error: object 'nsfg' not found
    filter(pregordr == 1) %>% # filtering for responses about R's first pregnancy (all pregnancies after the first are excluded).
    select(PREGEND1, agepreg, npostsmk, race, hispanic, pncarewk, paydeliv, WGT2017_2019, secu, sest) %>% # selecting all relevant social predictors including my dependent variable.
    rename(birth.outcome = PREGEND1, mom.age = agepreg, cigs.per.day = npostsmk, prenatal.care = pncarewk, delivery.payment.type = paydeliv) %>% # giving vars common sense names
    mutate(birth.outcome = factor(birth.outcome, levels = c(5, 6), labels = c("C-section", "vaginal birth"))) %>% # by setting birth.outcome of first pregnancy to live c-section or live vaginal birth, I am creating a nominal, dichotomous outcome variable (which is what I need for logistic regression) 
    mutate(cigs.per.day = factor(cigs.per.day, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 6), labels = c("about 1", "2-4", "5-14", "15-24", "35-44"))) %>% # removed the "25-34" category (5th level) because this response was empty
    mutate(hispanic = factor(hispanic, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Hispanic", "Non-hispanic"))) %>%
    mutate(race = factor(race, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("Black", "White", "Other"))) %>%
    mutate(prenatal.care = factor(prenatal.care, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("<13 weeks", ">14 weeks", "no prenatal care"))) %>%
    mutate(delivery.payment.type = factor(delivery.payment.type, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), labels = c("own income only", "insurance only", "own income & insurance only", "medicaid/govt assistance", "all other combinations of payment")))
